0,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 11 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings expects to assign a 'BBB' rating to Unum  Group Inc.'s (UNM) planned issuance of $300 million of senior unsecured notes  due 2024. UNM's Long-term Issuer Default Rating is not affected by this rating  action. Fitch affirmed the ratings of UNM and its insurance operating subsidiaries with  a stable outlook on Sept. 30, 2013. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch expects proceeds from the issuance to be used for general corporate  purposes. Barring any offsetting reduction in outstanding debt, Fitch expects  the new issuance to increase UNM's financial leverage to approximately 25%,  which is the upper limit Fitch has established for the company's ratings. The  company's financial leverage was approximately 23% at Dec. 31, 2013. UNM's recent operating performance has been in line with Fitch's expectations  for the company's current ratings. UNM is headquartered in Chattanooga, TN and reported total GAAP revenue of $10.4  billion in 2013 and shareholders' equity of $8.7 billion at Dec. 31, 2013.  RATING SENSITIVITIES  The key rating triggers that could lead to an upgrade include: --Improved general economic conditions including growth in employment, salaries  and disposable income which enable UNM to achieve its long-term target of 5%-7%  annual earnings growth on its core operations;  --GAAP earnings-based interest coverage over 12x and statutory maximum allowable  dividend coverage of interest expense over 5x; --U.S. risk-based capital ratio above 400% and run-rate financial leverage below  20%. Key rating triggers that could lead to a downgrade include: --Deterioration in financial results that includes an increase in the U.S. group  disability benefit ratio to over 87%; --GAAP earnings-based interest coverage falling below 8x and statutory maximum  allowable dividend interest expense coverage falling below 3x;  --Any additional reserve strengthening charges in the near term; --Holding company cash falling below management's target of approximately 1x  fixed charges (interest expense plus common stock dividend), or roughly $300  million; --U.S. risk-based capital ratio below 350% and financial leverage above 25%. Fitch expects to assign the following rating: Unum Group Inc. --$300 million senior unsecured notes due 2024 'BBB'.  Contact: Primary Analyst Bradley S.

1,"  (Repeat for additional subscribers)July 17 (The following statement was released by the rating agency)Fitch Ratings has affirmed Unum Group Inc.'s (NYSE:UNM)  holding company ratings, including the senior debt rating at 'BBB'. In addition,  Fitch affirms the Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) ratings for of all of UNM's  domestic operating subsidiaries at 'A'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full  list of ratings follows at the end of this release.KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating rationale includes the following: UNM's overall operating  performance, which has remained strong despite continued adverse global economic  conditions; conservative investment portfolio; solid capital and liquidity at  both the insurance subsidiary and holding company levels; the company's  leadership position in the U.S. employee benefits market; and increased  diversification. Offsetting these positives are Unum U.K.'s somewhat stagnant  recent results and continued challenges UNM faces in managing its run-off  long-term care book of business, particularly in the current low interest rate  environment.The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's belief that while UNM's premium growth and  operating margins continue to be challenged by the weak economic environment and  competitive market conditions, the company's overall profitability will continue  to support the current rating. Operating margins in UNM's U.S. disability  business have held up better than Fitch's expectations, and they have favorable  relative to the company's peers. The company has been experiencing an improving  trend in the benefit ratio of its core U.S. group disability income business  over the past year and a half, which has helped support the company's overall  profitability.While Unum U.K. results have shown deterioration, particularly within the group  life segment, the company has taken steps to improve results going forward  including implementing significant rate increases and claims management  improvements while reducing its focus on the large case market. Unum U.K. also  entered into a 50% coinsurance arrangement effective Jan. 1, 2013 designed to  reduce earnings volatility and capital requirements. While these measures appear  to have halted deterioration in the unit's operating profitability, persistency  has suffered, particularly in the U.K. group life segment.During 2013, UNM repurchased $319 million of its shares, down from $501 million  in 2012. Fitch's expectation is that further share repurchases will be funded  through operating earnings to mitigate the impact on financial leverage and the  capitalization of the operating subsidiaries. Further, Fitch generally views  measured stock repurchase as a more prudent use of capital than acquisitions or  premium growth in a soft rate environment.UNM's financial leverage was 25% at March 31, 2014. Fitch considers the  company's debt service capacity to be strong for the rating level with GAAP  earnings based interest coverage of 9.5x in 2013. Holding company liquidity,  including an intermediate holding company, totaled $820 million at March 31,  2014. UNM reported consolidated risk-based capital of its U.S. insurance  subsidiaries 403% at Dec. 31, 2013, which is at the high end of management's  near to intermediate term target of 375% - 400%.RATING SENSITIVITIES The key rating triggers that could lead to an upgrade include:--Improved general economic conditions including a growth in employment,  salaries and disposable income which enable UNM to achieve its long-term target  of 5% - 7% annual earnings growth on its core operations.--GAAP earnings-based interest coverage over 12x and statutory maximum allowable  dividend coverage of interest expense over 5x.--U.S. risk-based capital ratio above 400% and run-rate financial leverage below  20%.Key rating triggers that could lead to a downgrade include:--Deterioration in financial results that includes an increase in the U.S. groupdisability benefit ratio over 87%, GAAP earnings-based interest coverage falling  below 8x, and statutory maximum allowable dividend interest expense coverage  falling below 3x. --Any additional reserve strengthening charges in the near  term; --Holding company cash falls below management's target of approximately 1x fixed  charges (interest expense plus common stock dividend), or roughly $290 million.--U.S. risk-based capital ratio below 350% and financial leverage above 25%.

2,"  (Adds details from conference call)By Soham ChatterjeeAug 27 Workday Inc reported a better-than-expected 74 percent rise in quarterly revenue due to strong growth in subscriptions for its Web-based human resources and financial management software, and the company raised its full-year revenue forecast.Workday's shares rose about 3 percent in extended trading.The company's subscription revenue jumped 77 percent in the second quarter, accounting for three-quarters of total revenue.Workday said it had more than 800 customers for its human capital management and financial management software as of July 31, up from 675 customers at the end of April.Bank of America Corp became the company's largest human resource software customer in the quarter, Workday said on a conference call on Wednesday.In June, insurance provider Unum Group subscribed to Workday's financial and human resources software to manage nearly 10,000 employees. Workday, whose rivals include SAP SE and Oracle Corp, makes cloud-based software to manage employee performance, payroll and expenses.Cloud computing software, which allows customers to process data on remote servers, is faster and cheaper than traditional in-house systems. More companies are opting for Web-based software as they are easier to update, maintain and customize.""Our checks suggest that (Workday's) growth momentum remains solid and we expect upside trends to persist,"" Susquehanna analyst Derrick Wood wrote in a pre-earnings note.Workday raised its revenue forecast for the year ending Jan. 31 to $760 million-$770 million from $730 million-$750 million. Analysts were expecting revenue of $748.7 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Workday also raised its full-year billings forecast to $940 million-$960 million from $890 million-$910 million. Billings are a key indicator of the company's future sales.The company forecast revenue of $200 million-$205 million for the third quarter ending October, above the average analyst estimate of $195.6 million. However, its net loss widened to $69.2 million, or 38 cents per share, in the quarter ended July 31 from $36 million, or 21 cents per share, a year earlier, as it spends heavily on product development, sales and marketing, and workforce expansion.Excluding items, Workday had a loss of 11 cents per share.Revenue rose to $186.8 million from $107.6 million.Analysts on average had expected a loss of 14 cents per share and revenue of $177.5 million.Expenses jumped about 78 percent in the quarter as Workday invests in developing software for data analytics, financial management and recruitment to take on Salesforce.com and NetSuite Inc.The company said it expected to launch a data analytics product in November.Workday's shares closed at $90.30 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. Up to Wednesday's close, the stock had risen about 9 percent this year.
