The other 14 states run their own websites and some have also had issues.UnitedHealth said it held onto more small business and individual customers during the fourth quarter than usual because it had extended some existing small group plans that were due to expire into 2014 rather than canceling them.

8,"  NEW YORK Feb 19 A flurry of bearish bets placed Wednesday in the options for some health insurers caught the eye of several analysts, who said it appears that someone is banking on a sizeable drop in their stocks by the end of the week, which is also when 2015 Medicare payment rates are expected from the government.The most aggressive activity occurred in options on UnitedHealth Group Inc's shares, with a spate of purchases of puts that would benefit from a drop in the stock.According to options analytics firm TradeAlert, a trader bought 2,053 contracts of February puts at a strike price of $71, which is about 3.5 percent lower than the stock's current price of $73.55. These contracts will expire on Friday, and it has been more than two months since the stock has seen that large a move lower over a two-day period.The February $72 puts also saw heavy activity, according to TradeAlert. Volume was brisker than normal.""Given that other trades are usually 200-300 contracts (in the stock), this purchase, which was made so close to expiration, definitely seems to be some sort of speculative move if there is news coming out,"" said Randy Frederick, managing director at Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. Options activity in Humana Inc also perked up, with one of the most active contracts being some weekly February $94 puts that expire Feb. 28, as well as some monthly Feb $92.35 puts that expire on Friday. Both strike prices are substantially below the stock's $101.98 closing price on Wednesday.The activity comes ahead of a key government announcement due as early as this week about next year's expected Medicare reimbursement rates, a key revenue source for both UnitedHealth and Humana. It has jolted these stocks before. Just about one year ago, the stocks took a pounding when Medicare Advantage plan payment rates were forecast to be cut under a preliminary proposal from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Humana's shares plunged 6.4 percent in one day, while UnitedHealth's stock shed 3.7 percent over two days.The stocks rebounded sharply just over a month later when the final payment rates did not reflect as large a cut as originally proposed. Meanwhile, readings of implied volatility, a key component of options prices, have been rising for both stocks ahead of the expected announcement.The 30-day at-the-money implied call and put volatilities for United National Health were at around 23 on Wednesday, the highest level since before the company's third-quarter earnings announcement in October, according to Thomson Reuters data. The level was also higher than ahead of last year's Medicare rate announcement.In Humana, the 30-day implied volatility  options as well, up to nearly 40 percent from a day ago and at the highest level in nearly a year.As implied volatility rises, options premiums, or prices, typically follow suit, reflecting the elevated risk to the seller in the event of an outsized move in the stock.",2014-02-20,UNH,"Wed Feb 19, 2014 | 7:20pm EST",Bearish bets seen on U.S. insurers ahead of Medicare rate announcement,http://www.reuters.com//article/medicare-insurers-options-idUSL2N0LO24F20140220?type=companyNews
9,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, April 10 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed UnitedHealth Group Inc.'s  (UnitedHealth) ratings, including the rating on the company's senior unsecured  securities at 'A-' and insurance-company subsidiaries' Insurer Financial  Strength (IFS) ratings at 'AA-'. A complete list of rating actions follows at  the end of this release. The Rating Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings affirmation reflects Fitch's recognition that UnitedHealth has  continued to report strong operating margins and solid key credit metrics,  despite the headwinds presented by the implementation of various elements of the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA).  UnitedHealth reported record net earnings of $5.6 billion in 2013, which  translates into an EBITDA margin of 9.0%, versus 9.5% for the prior year period.  Despite the modest year-over-year decline, UnitedHealth's operating margins  remain strongly supportive of the company's current rating category. UnitedHealth's financial leverage improved moderately, benefitting from earnings  growth related to increased medical membership. UnitedHealth completed its purchase of Amil SA Participacoes S.A. (Amil)during the first  quarter of 2013 and issued debt in the second half of 2012 to help fund the  first step of the multi-stage transaction.  The company's financial leverage as measured by debt/ EBITDA improved to 1.5x at  Dec. 31, 2013 from 1.6x in the prior year. UnitedHealth reported EBITDA-to-interest coverage of 15.5x in 2013, a moderate decline from very  strong levels of 16.7x in 2012.  Fitch considers UnitedHealth's Debt-to-EBITDA ratio to be adequate relative to  the current rating category, while EBITDA-to-interest coverage remains strong  relative to its current ratings.  UnitedHealth's financial leverage as measured by its ratio of debt-to-total  capital also remains at a level that is adequate to support the current ratings.  As of Dec. 31, 2013, the company's debt-to-total capital ratio stood at 34%,  which is moderately higher than levels reported for the several years prior to  the Amil acquisition. Fitch views UnitedHealth's overall market position within the health insurance  and managed care sector as largely unique, in that it enjoys strength across a  broad spectrum of products, services, and geographies.  Fitch also notes the increasing scale and diversity of UnitedHealth's  businesses, particularly its sources of unregulated earnings and cash flows,  which have grown steadily over the past several years. UnitedHealth's Optum  business segment, which is comprised predominantly of unregulated businesses,  contributed over $2.3 billion of operating income in 2013, a $900 million  increase versus 2012. In Fitch's view, UnitedHealth's diversified business platform and scale  advantages provide increased confidence that the company will continue to  generate results that support the company's current high rating category,  despite the uncertainty created by the evolving regulatory environment facing  the health insurance industry. RATING SENSITIVITIES An upgrade to UnitedHealth's IFS ratings is unlikely over the next 12-24 months.  Upward rating pressure is constrained due to UnitedHealth's current ratings  approaching the high end of Fitch's ratings range for health insurers and the  possibility of continued unfavorable regulatory developments and their potential  effect on UnitedHealth's profits, primarily in government-sponsored businesses.  If the company were to report debt/EBITDA ratios approximating 1.0x and  debt-to-capital below 30% on a sustained basis, while maintaining  EBITDA/interest coverage ratios in the mid-teens or better, Fitch could compress  the notching between UnitedHealth's operating company IFS ratings and holding  company Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs). This would result in a one-notch upgrade  to UnitedHealth's debt ratings. Key rating triggers that could result in a downgrade to all of UnitedHealth's  ratings include developments related to healthcare reform that significantly  impair UnitedHealth's ability to appropriately price its products, or otherwise  severely restrict the company's cash flow. In addition, expectations for  sustained ratios of debt/EBITDA above 1.9x, debt-to-capital above 35% and  EBITDA/interest below 8x could lead to negative rating actions.

10,"   By Caroline Humer  UnitedHealth Group Inc, the largest U.S. health insurer, said it spent more than $100 million to cover a pricey new hepatitis C drug from Gilead Sciences Inc in its first three months on the market, an amount that was ""multiple"" times what it had expected.UnitedHealth is the first insurer to quantify its costs to cover patients using Gilead's new Sovaldi treatment, whose $84,000 price tag has spurred a national outcry over the rising costs of specialty medicines.UnitedHealth shares fell nearly 4 percent on Thursday and shares of rivals WellPoint Inc and Aetna Inc fell 3.8 percent and 3.4 percent, respectively, as investors weighed what their potential costs could be as well.The disclosure indicates that industry-wide, insurers spent $1 to $1.5 billion on treatments in the first quarter, Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Borsch said in a research note.U.S. drug regulators approved Sovaldi in December, the first of a handful of ground-breaking hepatitis C treatments that are expected to be on the market in the next few years.Sovaldi has been shown to cure most patients of the liver-wasting virus with few side effects, but health officials, insurers and Medicaid directors are balking at the cost. The national cost of treating even two-thirds of the estimated 3.2 million people with the virus could reach $200 billion.This has focused scrutiny on U.S. drug prices, which outstrip the rest of the world. Biotechnology shares were already in the midst of a selloff when U.S. lawmakers asked on March 21 for Gilead Sciences to explain the price for the Sovaldi treatment.Since then, shares of Gilead have lost more than 7 percent as investors feared that regulators and insurers would pressure the company to restrain prices. It pulled other biotech stocks down in tandem and the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index has dropped nearly 14 percent since March 20. Some doctors and health officials say the drug's cost must be viewed in comparison to spending on treating liver disease or on liver transplants, which can be more expensive and may not prevent a relapse in hepatitis C.Daniel Schumacher, chief financial officer of the group's UnitedHealthcare division, said the spending on Sovaldi could begin to moderate after the first big wave of patients are treated with the drug.He did not disclose what it had anticipated spending on the hepatitis C drug but said the cost ""is a multiple of what we had expected.""Because Sovaldi is widely viewed as a breakthrough in treating the liver-wasting virus in typically as few as 12 weeks, many doctors had waited for the drug before prescribing treatment to patients. ""What we're seeing is ... higher pent-up demand as there were more patients that were warehoused leading up to the launch,"" Schumacher said.UnitedHealth saw increased spending levels due to Sovaldi in its Medicaid, Medicare and commercial businesses during the first quarter of 2014, he said. A Gilead spokeswoman declined to comment.Schumacher said the company is working with state Medicaid directors, whose agencies could bear much of the cost because they cover a disproportionate share of people with the virus, and expects to be reimbursed at some point.State Medicaid directors are pushing Gilead for discounts, but it so far has refused to give much ground. Medicaid receives at least a mandatory 23 percent discount from pharmaceutical makers, but states can negotiate for more cuts. Some insurers, such as pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co, has said it will use anticipated products from AbbVie Inc and Merck & Co as price leverage with Gilead. ACA COSTS UnitedHealth said its quarterly profit was cut by 35 cents a share due to costs and taxes related to President Barack Obama's healthcare law, more formally known as the Affordable Care Act, and government cuts to private Medicare funding.The hepatitis C cost is one of several new pressures UnitedHealth said it has an eye on this year including commercial premium prices in several markets. In New York, which is also a large market for WellPoint, it said new competitors were underpricing at unsustainable levels.""This is really the first look of anyone operating under the full brunt of ACA-mandated cuts and sequestration and you have to revise your thinking a little bit,"" CRT Capital analyst Sheryl Skolnick said.UnitedHealth, a small player on the Obamacare exchanges created by that reform law in 2014, said that it had a ""bias"" towards expansion in 2015. Insurers must submit new plans and rates to the federal government by the end of June if they want to participate.The company's quarterly results slightly beat analyst expectations. UnitedHealth said net profit was $1.1 billion, or about $1.10 per share, compared with $1.2 billion, or $1.16 per share a year earlier. Analysts had expected first quarter profit of $1.09 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.UnitedHealth stuck by its previous forecast for 2014 earnings of $5.40 to $5.60 per share and said it sees revenue growth of about 5 percent to $128 billion to $129 billion.(Reporting by Caroline Humer; Editing by Michele Gershberg, Chizu Nomiyiama and Cynthia Osterman)",2014-04-17,UNH,"Thu Apr 17, 2014 | 2:30pm EDT",UnitedHealth: New hepatitis C drug costs far more than forecast,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-unitedheal-grp-results-idUSBREA3G0KN20140417?type=companyNews

The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose less than expected in the latest week and came near pre-recession levels. Factory activity in the U.S. mid-Atlantic region expanded in April at a faster clip than anticipated, according to a survey from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.The combined reported and expected earnings-per-share growth estimate for S&P 500 components rose to 1.7 percent from Wednesday's 0.6 percent, Thomson Reuters data showed, indicating  most companies that reported results in the past 24 hours exceeded expectations. The technology sector capped the S&P 500's gain, with Google  shares down 3.2 percent at $545.81 and IBM off 3.2 percent at $190.28 after both reported earnings late Wednesday that failed to impress Wall Street. Their results raised questions about those of other tech-sector companies.""The market is digesting the sharp move we've seen this week and doing its best to ignore the results from IBM and Google, which didn't look great,"" said Steve Sosnick, equity risk manager at Timber Hill/Interactive Brokers Group in Greenwich, Connecticut.""I'm mostly focused on bank earnings, which have been OK for the most part, and there haven't been many outliers, which is a good thing.""He said moves should be taken with a grain of salt as many trading desks are short-handed ahead of the long weekend. U.S. markets will be closed for Good Friday. Shares of Morgan Stanley, rose 3.6 percent to $30.97 after the financial services company reported a rise in first-quarter earnings, while Goldman Sachs edged up 0.4 percent to $157.91 after the bank reported an 11 percent drop in profits but beat expectations.UnitedHealth Group shares fell 3.2 percent to $75.70 after the largest U.S. health insurer said it has spent more than $100 million to cover a pricey new hepatitis C drug from Gilead Sciences, a higher cost than it expected by ""multiples."" Shares in the health insurance sector fell on the news, with WellPoint down 3.4 percent at $92.45.  Questions from U.S. lawmakers on the cost of that drug prompted a sharp selloff in Gilead in mid-March that  lasted for nearly a month.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 6.84 points or 0.04 percent, to 16,431.69. The S&P 500 gained 4.05 points or 0.22 percent, to 1,866.36. The Nasdaq Composite  added 15.908 points or 0.39 percent, to 4,102.133. If the indexes hold their gains, the Dow and the S&P 500 will post their largest weekly advance this year.General Electric posted a 12 percent rise in overall industrial profits and its shares gained 2.1 percent to $26.67.Shares of China's Weibo Corp opened slightly below the $17 pricing of its initial public offering, which was at the lower end of expectations on concerns about the microblogging service's slowing user growth. The stock, however, turned sharply higher and shot up 18.7 percent to $20.18 in afternoon trading.Western Union shares fell 3.8 percent to $15.44 after Wal-Mart Stores said it was launching a domestic money transfer service in partnership with Euronet Worldwide  subsidiary Ria Money Transfer.Shares of MoneyGram International, which currently provides money transfer services for Wal-Mart, plunged 15.3 percent to $15.23. Euronet shares rose 5.5 percent to $43.04. Wal-Mart's stock gained 0.6 percent to $77.71.Baker Hughes shares hit their highest since August 2011 after the world's third-largest oilfield services company posted better-than-expected results as revenue in its core North American business rose nearly 7 percent. The stock climbed 4.2 percent to $69.08 after earlier rising as high as $69.78.

The study, written by a team that focuses on executive compensation issues, provides a look into how much revenue the government could raise if it eliminated this deduction more broadly.      After examining the 10 largest publicly traded health insurers, it found that corporate taxes on their pay would likely increase in coming years because some 2013 compensation included stock options that predated the law.Based on those disclosures, it calculated the corporate tax each company paid on the compensation of the top five executives versus what the companies would have paid based on the U.S. tax code that applied to insurers prior to 2013 and that continues to be used by most other U.S. corporations outside of the health insurance industry. The report said that if all corporations were to be taxed this way, it would raise $50 billion more in revenue for the U.S. government.""I do see real momentum in applying this across the board,"" Sarah Anderson, Global Economy Project Director at the institute and a report author, said.

Health insurers have been at the center of the national healthcare reform law, which has set new benefit standards for coverage, changed government payments for private Medicare benefits, expanded Medicaid to more income levels and created a new type of health insurance for individuals.

22,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, September 22 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has published a new report detailing  key credit metrics of nine-publicly-traded U.S. health insurance and managed  care companies that are either rated or followed by Fitch: Aetna, Inc., Centene  Corp., Cigna Corp., Health Net Inc., Humana, Inc., Molina Health Care Inc.  UnitedHealth Group, Incorporated, WellCare Health Plans, Inc. and WellPoint,  Inc.  The report is meant to be used as a desktop guide, providing financial data and  rankings, key credit strengths and concerns, and current ratings levels and  rating sensitivities. Fitch views the key credit metrics of these nine publicly traded health insurers  as improving in the first half of 2014 compared to the prior year period. Strong  revenue growth driven by the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) exchanges and Medicaid  expansion, continuing popularity of Medicare Advantage products and  acquisition-related growth generated increases in EBITDA that more than offset  declining margins. Interest coverage ratios improved, and leverage ratios  declined modestly. The first section of the report includes company rankings based on revenue  growth, EBITDA margin and returns on capital as well as capitalization measures  such as debt-to-EBITDA and financial leverage. The second section of the report  provides a more detailed discussion of the nine individual companies including  credit strengths and concerns, ratings and rating triggers (where applicable),  and detailed information about each company's capital structure.

33,"   By Caroline Humer  UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) said on Thursday that patients had used medical services at low rates in the third quarter, easing worries among investors that higher admissions reported by hospitals would cost insurers more than they planned.UnitedHealth reported a net profit increase that beat Wall Street expectations and described medical use as ""restrained."" The portion of premiums that it spent on medical claims fell, including for the division that manages health plans sold on the new Obamacare health exchanges.The company said it expected medical cost trends to remain at slow growth rates and gave its first take on 2015, backing analysts' estimates for a profit of about $6.09 per share. UnitedHealth stock rose 4.6 percent to $85.98, lifting shares in competitors Aetna Inc (AET.N), WellPoint Inc WLP.N, Cigna Corp (CI.N) and Humana Inc (HUM.N) as well.Both hospitals and insurers are benefiting from increased patient volume, which appears to be related to the Affordable Care Act, Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte said. At the same time, UnitedHealth was clear that its costs were not rising. ""Medical costs as a percentage of premiums is the most important metric when investors are looking at core managed care, and they did tremendously well on it,"" Gupte said. The ACA, known as Obamacare, is estimated to have expanded insurance to more than 10 million more people through the creation of health exchanges and the expansion of Medicaid. The economic downturn and an increase in consumers' out-of-pocket costs for doctor and hospital visits have driven medical use down in recent years, but investors have been watching to see if that trend turned this year.  UnitedHealth Chief Financial Officer Dan Schumacher eased those worries, saying during a conference call that the company was seeing ""very stable utilization patterns"" and that medical costs during the third quarter were ""a little bit better"" than expected.The percentage of medical claims that UnitedHealth spent on care fell by 90 basis points to 79.7 percent in the third quarter. At its commercial business, which includes health plans in which UnitedHealth manages the risk, its medical care ratio decreased 220 basis points to 79.1 percent.

40,"   By Caroline Humer  UnitedHealth Group Inc, the largest U.S. health insurer, said on Friday that it hit the right competitive price in many of the 23 states where it will offer Obamacare plans for the first time this year including two of the biggest markets: Florida and Texas.""We think based on what we've seen so far we are actually going to be very competitive in key states,"" UnitedHealth Senior Vice President Jeff Lucht said on Friday in an interview.While the Obamacare plans are a very small component of UnitedHealth, which is estimated to have revenues of $130 billion this year, Wall Street analysts are watching to see who succeeds in the sector which is expected to be a high volume business with 3 to 5 percent profit margins.The government's Healthcare.gov website and other state-run health exchanges opened this week to allow consumers to get an early peak at individual plans that go on sale Nov. 15 when the open enrollment period opens. UnitedHealth, which dominates the employer-based insurance market, sold these individual plans in only 4 states for 2014.  Some other states where Lucht says that the company has among the lowest prices are Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Missouri. UnitedHealth is also selling individual insurance outside of the exchanges in all 23 markets.In 2014 just over 7 million people signed up for individual plans on the Obamacare exchanges, which were created under President Barack Obama's national healthcare reform and provide income-based subsidies. WellPoint Inc, Humana Incand Aetna Inc were among the largest players and competed with dozens of non-profit cooperatives, new health plans run by hospital groups and start-up insurers. In 2015, the number of insurers selling these plans will increase by 25 percent, the government has said. Some insurers have said they expect growth of anywhere from 20 percent to double their current enrollment or more. For 2015, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that 13 million people will sign up. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, however, has forecast enrollment at a total of 9.1 million.  It is not known how many of the 7 million people with 2014 plans will shop for new plans for 2015. A Gallup poll released on Friday said that 68 percent of the people who bought a policy on the government exchange planned to renew their current policy.

45,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, December 03 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-(EXP)' rating to  UnitedHealth Group Incorporated's (UnitedHealth) planned issue of senior notes  of various maturities.  The ratings are equivalent to Fitch's ratings on  UnitedHealth's currently outstanding senior notes. Fitch anticipates UnitedHealth using proceeds from the planned issuance for  general corporate purposes, including repayment of outstanding commercial paper.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The 'A-(EXP)' rating reflects expectations that UnitedHealth's capitalization  and interest coverage will not materially change from levels reported at Sept.  30, 2014. Specifically, Fitch expects that debt-to-total capital will remain at  35%, debt-to-annualized nine-month 2014 EBITDA should remain at 1.5x, and  EBITDA-to-interest expense would be approximately 18x. Fitch views UnitedHealth's overall market position within the health insurance  and managed care sector as largely unique, in that it enjoys strength across a  broad spectrum of products, services, and geographies.  UnitedHealth's ratings  continue to reflect strong operating margins consistent with Fitch's median  guidelines for the rating category. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch could upgrade UnitedHealth's ratings if the company were to report  debt/EBITDA ratios approximating 1.3x and debt-to-capital below 30% on a  sustained basis, while maintaining EBITDA/interest coverage ratios in the  mid-teens or better. Key rating triggers that could result in a downgrade to UnitedHealth's ratings  include developments related to healthcare reform that significantly impair  UnitedHealth's ability to appropriately price its products, or otherwise  severely restrict the company's cash flow. In addition, expectations for  sustained ratios of debt/EBITDA above 1.9x, debt-to-capital above 35%, and  EBITDA/interest below 8x could lead to negative rating actions.

46,"   By Rodrigo Campos | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. stocks edged up in a choppy Wednesday session as traders digested reports that new stimulus would be announced by the European Central Bank at its Thursday meeting, while declines in IBM limited gains.Market participants have been looking for more aggressive measures from central banks, specifically the ECB, to combat the risk of deflation and a weakening euro zone economy.A source told Reuters the ECB's Executive Board has proposed a program that would enable the bank to buy 50 billion euros ($58 billion) in bonds per month starting in March. ECB President Mario Draghi will speak to the media at 1330 GMT (8.30 a.m. EST) on Thursday. ""The ECB rumor was very important. The market's perception was that Draghi was going to disappoint tomorrow in the magnitude"" of the program, said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors in New York.He said that regardless of the size of the expected purchase program, there are many details to be decided in terms of the assets available for purchase and how those will affect individual members of the bloc.""The rules of the game may not be as fortuitous as investors and Draghi might like to be able to get the most bang for the buck."" U.S. stocks would benefit from a program to support the euro zone economy because Europe is one of the United States' most important trade partners.The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 39.05 points, or 0.22 percent, to 17,554.28, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 9.57 points, or 0.47 percent, to 2,032.12 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 12.58 points, or 0.27 percent, to 4,667.42.The S&P closed 2.8 percent below its record closing high set in late December.S&P 500 energy shares .SPNY were the day's best performers, up 1.8 percent alongside a 2.8 percent gain in the price of U.S. crude futures CLc1.

The stock was the biggest points decliner on the S&P 500 and weighed the most on the price-weighted Dow industrials.The blue-chip index, however, got a boost from UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N), which rose 3.5 percent to $109.32 after its fourth-quarter earnings topped expectations.

47,"  UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N), the largest U.S. health insurer, on Wednesday reported a better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit as it added new customers in government-paid plans and its Optum pharmacy management business hit record revenue.Profit in its health insurance business, which includes commercial and government customers, was helped by medical costs that the company described as being ""well controlled,"" and decreased inpatient hospital use per person in 2014. Low hospital and medical use has helped keep medical claims down and profits up at insurers during the past several years, even as the U.S. healthcare system has undergone major reform under the Affordable Care Act.""We believe these results offer a solid finish to a year of transition,"" BMO Capital Markets analyst Jennifer Lynch said in a research note.UnitedHealth's shares rose 2.2 percent in premarket trading. The company reported a medical care ratio, or the amount it spends on medical claims compared with the insurance premiums that it brings in, of 79.8 percent. It was 81.2 percent a year earlier.Health insurers have faced many changes during the past few years as the national healthcare reform law, often called Obamacare, took effect. The law has brought higher fees and taxes for insurers and has also created a new individual healthcare insurance market and expanded the ranks of Medicaid, which has helped increase revenue.The company reported quarterly revenue of $33.4 billion, up from $31.1 billion a year earlier. Revenue in its Optum  pharmacy management business increased to $8.5 billion from $6.9 billion a year earlier.

UnitedHealth's shares rose 2.2 percent in premarket trading.The company reported a medical care ratio, or the amount it spends on medical claims compared with the insurance premiums that it brings in, of 79.8 percent. It was 81.2 percent a year earlier. Health insurers have faced many changes during the past few years as the national healthcare reform law, often called Obamacare, took effect. The law has brought higher fees and taxes for insurers and has also created a new individual healthcare insurance market and expanded the ranks of Medicaid, which has helped increase revenue.The company reported quarterly revenue of $33.4 billion, up from $31.1 billion a year earlier. Revenue in its Optum  pharmacy management business increased to $8.5 billion from $6.9 billion a year earlier.

In its update, the insurer cites the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists as identifying vaginal hysterectomies as the preferred method.The Food and Drug Administration issued an advisory nearly a year ago recommending that surgeons avoid the use of surgical morcellators in performing hysterectomies because of evidence  the technique could spread cancerous tissue. Morcellators are devices used in laparoscopic surgery to cut up tissue so that it can be removed through small incision sites.

62,"   By Sneha Banerjee  Health insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) agreed to buy Catamaran Corp CTRX.OCCT.TO in a deal worth about $12.8 billion to boost its pharmacy benefit business as it competes with bigger rivals such as Express Scripts Holdings Co (ESRX.O).Pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) administer drug benefits for employers and health plans and run large mail order pharmacies, helping them get better prices from drugmakers.As employers look to cut prescription costs on expensive drugs, the deal with Catamaran will give UnitedHealth's pharmacy benefits unit, OptumRx, the scale to negotiate favorable prices from pharmacy companies.U.S. drug prices rose 12 percent in 2014 due to a new treatment for hepatitis C that cost more than $80,000 but cured almost all recipients with few side effects. Another new class of drugs, to treat high cholesterol, is expected to hit the market in 2015 and has insurers worried about drug costs this year as well.The purchase of Catamaran will increase UnitedHealth's market share to 15 percent to 20 percent of the people who receive their drug benefits through pharmacy benefit managers, BMO Capital Markets analyst Jennifer Lynch said in a research note. With a combined 1 billion scripts annually, UnitedHealth will be about the same size as current industry number two, CVS Health Corp (CVS.N), she added. Catamaran was formed after SXC Health Solutions and PBM Catalyst Health Solutions merged in 2012.UnitedHealth's offer of $61.50 per share represents a premium of 27 percent to Catamaran's Friday close on the Nasdaq.Catamaran's stock was trading at $60.01 premarket on Monday, while UnitedHealth was up nearly 4 percent. The deal ""makes sense to us, but admittedly came much earlier than we expected,"" Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut said in a research note.""We had always viewed Catamaran as a compelling asset for companies looking for scale in the PBM sector such as Optum or Walgreens but expected Catamaran to grow the business much further before pursuing a sale.""He added that the offer seemed adequate and he did not expect competing bids at this point. The deal value is based on Illinois-based Catamaran's total diluted shares outstanding as of Dec. 31.The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2015 and add about 30 cents per share to UnitedHealth's profit in 2016, the companies said.Catamaran Chief Executive Officer Mark Thierer will be CEO of OptumRx and OptumRx CEO Timothy Wicks will become president.

63,"   By Caroline Humer | NEW YORK  NEW YORK UnitedHealth Group Inc's (UNH.N) planned takeover of No. 4 U.S. pharmacy benefits provider Catamaran Corp CCT.TO will give the companies added heft in price talks with drug companies, serving as a catalyst for deals allowing other insurers to bulk up.The $12.8 billion deal comes at a time when Wall Street has been parsing the possibilities that top insurers like Aetna Inc (AET.N) with Cigna Corp (CI.N) could pair up. Smaller companies like Health Net Inc HNT.N , Molina Healthcare Inc (MOL.N) or WellCare Health Plans Inc (WCG.N) are also increasingly seen as takeover targets.""There has been chatter about large-scale M&A coming out of some recent investor conferences,"" Mizuho Securities senior healthcare analyst Sheryl Skolnick said. ""I don't know if $12.8 billion qualifies as large scale M&A in the space, but now you have the answer. Yes, there will be transactions.""Express Scripts Holdings Corp (ESRX.O), the largest pharmacy benefit manager and the only stand-alone PBM, may be pressed to do a deal with a distribution company or pharmacy if margins become too tight, analysts said on Monday.The link-up could force a tie-up between Express Scripts and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA.O), for instance, which has pharmacy and drug distribution operations but no pharmacy management business, Evercore ISI analyst Michael Cherny said in a research report.

64,"   By Caroline Humer | NEW YORK, March 30  NEW YORK, March 30 UnitedHealth Group Inc's  planned takeover of No. 4 U.S. pharmacy benefits provider Catamaran Corp will give the companies added heft in price talks with drug companies, serving as a catalyst for deals allowing other insurers to bulk up.The $12.8 billion deal comes at a time when Wall Street has been parsing the possibilities that top insurers like Aetna Inc  with Cigna Corp could pair up. Smaller companies like Health Net Inc, Molina Healthcare Inc or WellCare Health Plans Inc are also increasingly seen as takeover targets.""There has been chatter about large-scale M&A coming out of some recent investor conferences,"" Mizuho Securities senior healthcare analyst Sheryl Skolnick said. ""I don't know if $12.8 billion qualifies as large scale M&A in the space, but now you have the answer. Yes, there will be transactions.""Express Scripts Holdings Corp, the largest pharmacy benefit manager and the only stand-alone PBM, may be pressed to do a deal with a distribution company or pharmacy if margins become too tight, analysts said on Monday.The link-up could force a tie-up between Express Scripts and Walgreens Boots Alliance, for instance, which has pharmacy and drug distribution operations but no pharmacy management business, Evercore ISI analyst Michael Cherny said in a research report.That could put it at a disadvantage to CVS Health, the No. 2 pharmacy benefit manager which also owns one of the nation's largest pharmacy chains.

65,"  (Adds Breakingviews link)By Sneha BanerjeeMarch 30 Health insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc  agreed to buy Catamaran Corp  in a deal worth about $12.8 billion to boost its pharmacy benefit business as it competes with bigger rivals such as Express Scripts Holdings Co.Pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) administer drug benefits for employers and health plans and run large mail order pharmacies, helping them get better prices from drugmakers.As employers look to cut prescription costs on expensive drugs, the deal with Catamaran will give UnitedHealth's pharmacy benefits unit, OptumRx, the scale to negotiate favorable prices from pharmacy companies.U.S. drug prices rose 12 percent in 2014 due to a new treatment for hepatitis C that cost more than $80,000 but cured almost all recipients with few side effects. Another new class of drugs, to treat high cholesterol, is expected to hit the market in 2015 and has insurers worried about drug costs this year as well.The purchase of Catamaran will increase UnitedHealth's market share to 15 percent to 20 percent of the people who receive their drug benefits through pharmacy benefit managers, BMO Capital Markets analyst Jennifer Lynch said in a research note. With a combined 1 billion scripts annually, UnitedHealth will be about the same size as current industry number two, CVS Health Corp, she added.Catamaran was formed after SXC Health Solutions and PBM Catalyst Health Solutions merged in 2012.UnitedHealth's offer of $61.50 per share represents a premium of 27 percent to Catamaran's Friday close on the Nasdaq. Catamaran's stock was trading at $60.01 premarket on Monday, while UnitedHealth was up nearly 4 percent.The deal ""makes sense to us, but admittedly came much earlier than we expected,"" Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut said in a research note.""We had always viewed Catamaran as a compelling asset for companies looking for scale in the PBM sector such as Optum or Walgreens but expected Catamaran to grow the business much further before pursuing a sale."" He added that the offer seemed adequate and he did not expect competing bids at this point.The deal value is based on Illinois-based Catamaran's total diluted shares outstanding as of Dec. 31.The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2015 and add about 30 cents per share to UnitedHealth's profit in 2016, the companies said.Catamaran Chief Executive Officer Mark Thierer will be CEO of OptumRx and OptumRx CEO Timothy Wicks will become president.(Additional reporting by Caroline Humer in New York; Editing by Savio D'Souza, Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Meredith Mazzilli)",2015-03-30,UNH,"Mon Mar 30, 2015 | 2:50pm EDT",UPDATE 4-UnitedHealth to buy pharmacy benefit firm Catamaran for $12.8 bln,http://www.reuters.com//article/catamaran-ma-unitedheal-grp-idUSL3N0WW3HB20150330?type=companyNews

UnitedHealth's increased participation in the second open enrollment period on healthcare exchanges from November to February was a major driver of membership increases.The company's individual and employer plans served 680,000 more people in the first quarter and 320,000 more people year-over-year under the public healthcare exchanges, UnitedHealth said.Revenue from the Optum business, which includes a managed care, software and consulting, and pharmacy benefit management, rose 15 percent to $12.82 billion.The company raised its full-year profit forecast to $6.15-$6.30 per share and said it now expects revenue of about $143 billion in 2015.UnitedHealth shares had risen 48 percent in the past 12 months to Wednesday's close, outperforming a 10 percent rise in Dow Jones Industrial Average Index.

(on.wsj.com/1JTBQP0)Anthem's last bid was worth about $175 per Cigna share, the Journal said, valuing the company at about $45 billion according to Thomson Reuters calculations.Cigna had a market capitalization of $35.34 billion as of Friday's close. U.S. health insurers have come under pressure as the government and employers toughen their stance on spending for medical procedures and drugs. In such a scenario, growing through acquisitions makes sense and could even grant insurers leverage in negotiating prices with hospitals.Cigna's rejection of Anthem's takeover offer is the latest in a series of moves involving potential deals in the sector.UnitedHealth Group Inc, the largest U.S. health insurer, is also eyeing Cigna and Aetna, the Journal said on Monday, citing sources.

84,"  * Deal to create leader in government health insurance programs* Deal could prompt mergers among smaller insurers - analyst* Health Net shares rose as much as 18 pct, shy of 21 pct premium   (Adds Breakingviews link)By Vidya L Nathan and Amrutha PenumudiJuly 2 U.S. health insurer Centene Corp  will buy smaller rival Health Net Inc for $6.3 billion, underscoring the healthcare industry's rush to bulk up to negotiate better prices with suppliers and hospitals, and attract new customers.Health Net's shares touched a record high of $76.67 on Thursday, but stayed shy of Centene's offer of $78.57, which is at a 21 percent premium. Centene shares were down 3 percent at $78.42. The deal comes a week after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld subsidies for individuals under President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law, keeping a large chunk of patients intact under the Medicare and Medicaid programs.Insurers have said subsidies are key to bringing in new customers and the ruling has removed uncertainty for insurers looking for acquisitions. It could also spur more deal making in the health insurance sector, which has already seen a blitz of merger activity this year.Aetna Inc, the third largest insurer is looking to buy smaller rival Humana Inc. No. 2 Anthem Inc  has offered to buy Cigna Corp to create the largest insurer in the country, toppling UnitedHealth Group Inc  . Media reports have also said UnitedHealth could be eyeing Cigna and Aetna. Health insurers are not alone in trying to beef up.Drugmakers, retailers and pharmacy benefit managers have contributed to the wave of healthcare acquisitions since 2014, pushing deal-making in the industry to record levels.Also, an expected increase in federal interest rates, which will make borrowing costly, is expected to push companies to close deals over the next few months. UnitedHealth could bid for either Health Net or Centene, or even the combined company, Leerink & Co analyst Anagha Gupte said. Gupte said she now expects other smaller insurers such as WellCare Health Plans Inc and Molina Healthcare Inc  to merge.Centene's buyout of Health Net will catapult it to the top of the government insurance heap, ahead of bigger rivals who dominate the private insurance market.The combined company will serve more than 10 million members across the country, but will still be small in terms of total membership. Market leader UnitedHealth, for example, has nearly 46 million members.Centene, which will also assume $500 million in Health Net debt, said the deal is expected to boost adjusted profit by more than 20 percent in the first year.(Editing by Savio D'Souza and Sayantani Ghosh)",2015-07-02,UNH,"Thu Jul 2, 2015 | 4:09pm EDT",UPDATE 3-Health insurer Centene adds muscle with $6.3 bln Health Net deal,http://www.reuters.com//article/health-net-ma-centene-idUSL3N0ZI3QS20150702?type=companyNews

87,"  * Combined company will cover about 53 million members* To pay $103.40 in cash and 0.5152 for every Cigna share* Says confident of getting regulatory approvals   (Adds comments from Anthem, Cigna CEOs, background on businesses)By Ankur Banerjee and Ransdell PiersonJuly 24 Anthem Inc said on Friday it would buy Cigna Corp for about $54.2 billion, a deal that would create the largest U.S. health insurer by membership and accelerate the consolidation of an industry from five national players to three.The proposed acquisition - the biggest ever in the health insurance industry - comes three weeks after Aetna Inc  agreed to buy Humana Inc for $37 billion.Health insurers are finding it tougher to raise prices following the roll-out of President Barack Obama's healthcare law, while grappling with soaring costs for a growing list of innovative new medications such as some new cancer drugs that cost $100,000 annually for patients.State insurance regulators and federal antitrust authorities are expected to aggressively scrutinize how both of the proposed health insurer acquisitions will affect competition for Medicare and individual and commercial insurance.Under the deal, which the companies expect to close in the second half of 2016, Anthem Chief Executive Joseph Swedish would serve as CEO and Chairman of the combined company. Cigna CEO David Cordani would be president and Chief Operating Officer.In a joint conference call with industry analysts, Swedish said that Anthem has had no discussions ""at all"" with regulators ahead of the deal announcement, but was confident it will receive their approval. Shares of Cigna on Friday were trading at $147.64, far below their $188 per share value under the announced deal, suggesting significant Wall Street skepticism over whether it will survive antitrust scrutiny.""Strategically and financially it's very attractive, but they will face regulatory scrutiny,"" said Ana Gupte, analyst with Leerink Partners. ""They also both possibly face divestitures and may have to make concessions to consumers to make the merger go through.""The same apparent wariness of approval has been seen with Aetna's planned purchase of Humana. Humana shares are trading in the $183 range, well below the value of Aetna's cash-and-stock offer of $230 per share when it was first announced.Both Anthem and Cigna would be liable to pay the other a fee equivalent to 3.8 percent of the deal's value if either of them walk away from the planned merger. BIGGER THAN UNITEDHEALTH Anthem and Cigna are two of just four major insurers that administer self-insured plans for major companies. The other two are UnitedHealth Group Inc and Aetna. The combined company would have about 53 million members. UnitedHealth had 45.86 million members as of June 30.Growing concerns about market concentration came into sharp focus earlier this year when regulatory concerns scuttled Comcast Corp's $45 billion bid for Time Warner Cable Inc. Anthem said it will pay $103.40 in cash and 0.5152 of its shares for every Cigna share. The deal is valued at $183.36 per share based on Anthem's Thursday close of $155.21. Anthem said the offer is valued at $188 per share, based on its unaffected share price as of May 28 before media reports surfaced that the two companies were in talks.The equity portion of the offer is valued at $49.11 billion, according to Reuters calculations based on 261.2 million Cigna shares outstanding as of March 31.Swedish said Anthem's mainstay Blue Cross/Blue Shield insurance coverage requires the company to maintain a concentrated focus on that business, according to Blue Cross rules.""We will remain Blue,"" Swedish said on the conference call, adding that Anthem feels confident that even after acquiring Cigna and its core Medicare Advantage plans, the combined company will satisfy ""the Blue rules.""The company has said the deal will help it reduce costs and allow it to negotiate lower prices with doctors and hospitals.(The) spirit of our collaboration going forward is total collaboration,"" Swedish said, saying his and Cordani's different roles and responsibilities ""are perfectly aligned.""Swedish said he intended to remain CEO of the combined company for two years, and afterward become chairman.Anthem's lead financial adviser is UBS Investment Bank. Credit Suisse also served as financial adviser, and White & Case LLP as legal adviser.Morgan Stanley is Cigna's financial adviser and Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP its legal adviser.

89,"  (Adds comments, background, share price)By Caroline HumerOct 15 UnitedHealth Group Inc reported a slightly better-than-expected profit in the third quarter, helped by stable medical costs in its health plans, but failed to impress investors and its shares fell more than 2 percent in midday trading.Analysts said shares in UnitedHealth, the largest U.S. health insurer and the first to report, have tended to fall following profit reports if the company has not well exceeded Wall Street expectations.""It's sentiment as opposed to true fundamentals,"" said Mizuho Securities Managing Director Sheryl Skolnick.In terms of medical costs being stable, the company said members were using medical services at the rates it had anticipated, a key indicator of whether the company will be able to meets its profit expectations.The stock was down 2.4 percent at $119.10, after falling as much as 4 percent earlier. Shares of other insurers, like Anthem Inc and Aetna Inc, also fell, each shedding  more than 1 percent. Insurers' shares have risen this year on expectations for industry consolidation. UnitedHealth has jumped about 20 percent, while Aetna surged more than 40 percent in the first six months of the year.In July, Aetna announced plans to buy Humana Inc and Anthem said it would buy Cigna Corp. Aetna shares have fallen 15 percent since the deal was announced, while UnitedHealth has dipped 3 percent during that period, as the companies undergo antitrust scrutiny.Investors are also focused on insurer medical costs, Skolnick said. The company said medical costs were as expected and it kept to its spending trend outlook, an indication that the use of medical services by patients was not increasing unexpectedly. UnitedHealth said the percentage of premiums paid for medical services fell 80 basis points in the third quarter from the second quarter.That medical loss ratio - a key metric in the industry that shows the proportion of premiums used for patient-care costs - increased over a year ago by 90 basis points to 80.6 percent due to higher spending in some Medicare Advantage plans for seniors and the disabled. That is aimed at meeting the government's more stringent quality measures for these plans.A shift in its business mix to more government business, where patient costs are higher compared to employer-based insurance, also contributed to the year-over-year decline in the medical loss ratio, the company said. Costs for plans sold through the public exchanges created under President Barack Obama's national healthcare reform pressured its operating margins, the company said. UnitedHealth sold individual plans in about two dozen states in 2015, up from just a few states in 2014.The company plans to add 11 more states in 2015, and said it had priced its new 2016 plans to take these costs into account.While the individual Obamacare health insurance business was a drag in 2015, UnitedHealth said it believed performance would be ""strikingly"" better in 2016.Net profit attributable to UnitedHealth shareholders was little changed at $1.60 billion, or $1.65 per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30.

95,"   By Carl O'Donnell, Tim Reid and Caroline Humer | NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES  NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES OptumRx, a leading U.S. pharmacy benefits manager, began to stop payments to a pharmacy closely-linked to Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX.N) more than a year ago after recognizing billing irregularities, former employees at the pharmacy and sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.Hatboro, Pennsylvania-based Philidor Rx Services persisted in efforts to secure reimbursement for Valeant drug sales even after receiving a cease-and-desist order from OptumRx, one of its largest revenue sources, in September 2014, two sources familiar with the matter said. OptumRx is owned by UnitedHealth Group (UNH.N).In response, Philidor submitted claims to OptumRx for Valeant drugs using the identification numbers of at least four other affiliated pharmacies, these sources said.    Philidor's business practices are at the heart of fraud allegations posed in late October by Citron Research's Andrew Left, an influential short-seller in Valeant stock. Valeant had already come under scrutiny for charging high mark-ups on drugs made by companies it has acquired.     Its ties to Philidor, which surfaced two weeks ago, have led investors to question Valeant's legal liabilities and future prospects, sending its shares down 45 percent. Valeant has denied Left's accusation that it used Philidor to inflate its revenue. But it prompted the drugmaker to disclose that it paid Philidor $100 million for an option to acquire the company in December, raising questions of what it knew of Philidor's practices.OptumRx's September cease-and-desist letter cited a breach of its contract with Philidor, the sources familiar with the matter said. It isn't clear what billing irregularities caused OptumRx to send the letter, the sources said.In the months that followed, OptumRx recognized that drug reimbursement claims filed with the identification numbers of four other pharmacies could be traced to Philidor, the sources said. Starting in January, OptumRx sent cease-and-desist letters to the pharmacies, which worked in a network run by Philidor, the sources said. Spokespeople for both Valeant and Philidor declined to comment.""OptumRx works every day to protect the interests of our customers and members,"" said OptumRx spokesman Matt Stearns. ""That is why we began terminating Philidor from our networks months ago, and why we monitor closely the practices of all the pharmacies with whom we do business.""OPTION TO BUY      Philidor primarily dispenses Valeant drugs directly to patients, and then presses payers like OptumRx to cover the cost, contributing nearly 6 percent of Valeant's total revenue so far this year. The company said last week it will sever ties to Philidor and set up an internal committee to review the allegations regarding Valeant's business relationships with Philidor.The Wall Street Journal reported that a Philidor training manual from a year ago instructed employees to use another pharmacy's identification number to file claims with insurers who don't have a contract with the pharmacy.In interviews with Reuters, former employees and sources familiar with the matter said that the practice was also applied to OptumRx, which had a contract on reimbursement to Philidor. It continued at least into early 2015, after Valeant had purchased the option to buy Philidor, giving it the right to name certain employees and be on a joint steering committee with its distribution partner.     One former Philidor employee said he was informed by his manager in the fall of 2014 that OptumRx was not taking Philidor claims. The employee was told to bill the benefits manager using the National Provider Identification number - unique identifiers issued by the government – of West Wilshire Pharmacy in Los Angeles. By early 2015, Philidor was also using the NPIs of R&O Pharmacy LLC in Camarillo, California, and of SafeRx in South Plainfield, New Jersey, to bill OptumRx.     ""Our main approach was to use West Wilshire's NPI,"" said a second former employee. ""We would sometimes still try to do it with Philidor's NPI, but we were pretty much always turned down, at which point we would use West Wilshire's.""     Philidor asked its employees not to discuss its dealings with OptumRx in emails, and devoted special training sessions to how to successfully bill OptumRx after it began rejecting Philidor claims, the former employees said. A fourth pharmacy whose NPI was used to bill OptumRx was Orbit Pharmacy in Houston.     Orbit referred questions to Philidor's general counsel, Gretchen Wisehart. Wisehart did not respond to requests for comment. Calls to West Wilshire and SafeRx went unanswered.    West Wilshire was the first pharmacy to receive a cease-and-desist letter, in January, the sources familiar with the matter said. Shortly afterward, OptumRx conducted an unannounced inspection of R&O Pharmacy in California where it determined that R&O was working with Philidor and was in the process of being acquired by a Philidor affiliate, the sources said.      OptumRx issued a cease and desist letter barring R&O from doing business with the benefits manager, the sources said. R&O has accused Philidor of fraudulently using its NPI to dispense drugs that R&O doesn't stock.According to California pharmacy law, a state-licensed pharmacy can fill prescriptions on behalf of another pharmacy, but it must be clearly documented to patients that the state-licensed pharmacy is the one providing the medication.

97,"  (Repeats to show availability of photos)* UnitedHealth to decide next year whether to leave exchanges* CEO says Obamacare exchanges may not be sustaining themselves* Shares fall 4.5 percent, weigh on other insurers, hospitalsBy Caroline HumerNov 19 UnitedHealth Group Inc, the largest U.S. health insurer, warned on Thursday that it might stop selling individual health plans on the Obamacare exchanges in 2017, citing weak enrollment and high medical costs for people who did sign up.UnitedHealth's comments raise new questions about the viability of individual insurance exchanges set up under President Barack Obama's healthcare law. Rival insurers Aetna Inc and Anthem Inc also said last month they were seeing too few people sign up, but have not signaled they would exit the business.""We cannot sustain these losses,"" UnitedHealth Chief Executive Stephen Hemsley said during a conference call with investors. ""We can't really subsidize a marketplace that doesn't appear at the moment to be sustaining itself.""A deterioration in the exchanges in the midst of the 2016 election campaign could provide additional fuel to Republican efforts to overturn the healthcare law. Several of Obama's fellow Democrats are also considering changes to the Affordable Care Act, including whether to alter the ""Cadillac tax,"" a levy on high-cost health plans sponsored by employers. UnitedHealth shares fell 4.5 percent on Thursday, while Aetna lost 5.7 percent, and Anthem dropped 6.2 percent. Hospital operators, which had benefited in recent years from a rise in insured patients, also fell, with HCA Holdings Inc  shares down 5.7 percent and Community Health Systems  down 8.3 percent.UnitedHealth has about 500,000 members with Obamacare plans, making it the fourth-largest insurer on the exchanges. On Thursday, the company said it expected these plans to hurt current-quarter profit by $425 million, or 26 cents per share.As a result, the company said it cut its full-year earnings forecast to $6 per share from a previous range of $6.25 to $6.35.UnitedHealth also said it was pulling back on 2016 advertising. For next year, it forecast earnings of $7.10 to $7.30 per share. Analysts on average are expecting $7.28, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company plans to evaluate during the first half of next year whether it would continue to offer Obamacare plans in 2017.More than 9 million people are enrolled through the exchanges, which operate in each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The majority of the policyholders receive some level of government subsidy to help pay for the plans, based on household income. The government recently estimated that 10 million people would enroll in 2016.NEW COST CONCERNS  Just a month ago, UnitedHealth said that it was expecting substantial improvement for the Obamacare business in 2016. Hemsley said that since then, the enrollment picture has become worse, and it has become clearer that the medical costs of new customers were unsustainable.UnitedHealth had entered a small number of markets in 2014, the first year that the exchanges opened, but began selling plans in about two dozen states in 2015. It is still a smaller player on these markets than Anthem, Aetna and Humana Inc .Insurers had criticized the exchanges before they opened, due to technology problems tied to the federal government-run HealthCare.gov website and concerns about the cost of covering customers who might be sicker than the general population.The Obama administration mitigated some of that risk in the first year with payments to insurers, but that funding has since declined. About a dozen nonprofit cooperative health plans that sold plans on the exchanges have collapsed.Consumers have also criticized plans for requiring them to meet high deductibles out of pocket before their coverage kicks in, as well as steep increases in monthly premiums from year to year.The company said the rest of its business continued to perform in line with its expectations.""If exchange pricing/risk does not stabilize near-term,"" Susquehanna analyst Chris Rigg wrote in a note, ""we'd expect a quick rebound in profits as (UnitedHealth) exits this business line.""

108,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, December 03 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'A' Issuer Default  Rating and 'A-' senior unsecured notes rating of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated  (UNH) as well as the 'AA-' Insurer Financial Strength ratings of its insurance  company subsidiaries. The Rating Outlook is Negative.  See the complete list of  rating actions at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS     The affirmation of UNH's ratings reflects the company's leading market position  and significant size and scale as well as continued strong operating performance  from diverse sources. Balanced against these strengths is the increased  financial leverage associated with the company's recent acquisition of Catamaran  Corporation (CTRX). The Negative Outlooks reflect uncertainty as to UNH's ability to reduce its  financial leverage to levels more commensurate with the company's current  ratings and, to a lesser extent, the potential operational and earnings  disruptions that could arise during the CTRX integration. UNH is currently the largest U.S. health insurer in terms of total revenues,  GAAP equity and total medical membership. Fitch categorizes UNH as having a  'large' market position and size/scale under the agency's rating criteria, and  companies with this profile are supportive of the 'AA' category. The company's  credit profile also benefits from significant cash flows derived from  subsidiaries whose dividend payments are generally less heavily regulated than  those of health insurers. UNH completed its acquisition of CTRX in the third quarter of 2015. CTRX offers  retail pharmacy services to health plans and employers and provides healthcare  information technology solutions to the pharmacy benefits management industry.  UNH raised $14 billion in debt, including $10.5 billion in senior unsecured  notes with a variety of maturities, to fund the acquisition. Financial leverage ratios have fallen outside Fitch's medians for the current  rating category following July's debt issuance to fund the CTRX acquisition.  Specifically, UNH's debt-to-EBITDA and debt-to-total capital ratios increased to  2.5x and 49% as of Sept. 30, 2015 from 1.5x and 35% at Dec. 31, 2014. Fitch  estimates UNH's EBITDA-based interest coverage was 12.2x based on a rolling  four-quarter EBITDA through Sept. 30, 2015 and forecasted full year 2016  interest expense.  This ratio is down significantly from a very strong 19x for  full-year 2014. UNH's ratings recognize the company's solid operating margins and overall  profitability, as well as the inherent strength and diversity of the company's  health benefits and health services operations. UNH reported an EBITDA margin of  8.6% through the first nine months of 2015, down compared with 9.0% for  full-year 2014. UNH's operating margins remain supportive of the company's  current rating. UNH's businesses display great scale and diversity. Sources of unregulated  earnings and cash flows have grown steadily over the past several years. The  company's Optum business segment contributed $2.7 billion of pre-tax income in  the first nine months of 2015. CTRX increases UNH's scale and diversity,  particularly its sources of unregulated earnings and cash flows.

120,"   By Caroline Humer  U.S. health insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc on Tuesday said it would largely exit the Obamacare individual insurance market in 2017, citing expectations for mounting losses from the program.UnitedHealth is the largest U.S. health insurer and one of the biggest sellers of plans on the exchanges, which were created as part of President Barack Obama's national healthcare law. UnitedHealth sells these plans in 34 states this year, up from 25 states last year.""Next year, we will remain in only a handful of states,"" UnitedHealth CEO Stephen Hemsley said in prepared remarks as part of the company's first-quarter earnings report. The company warned investors late last year that it was losing money on the new plans and might exit the market. On Tuesday, the company raised its 2016 expectation for losses on the exchanges by $125 million to $650 million.UnitedHealth's Hemsley said that the shorter term, higher risk profile of the new members, as well as the smaller than expected enrollment, suggested UnitedHealth could not offer plans on a sustained basis.  For the first quarter, United Health's profit was better-than-expected and UnitedHealth shares rose 1.9 percent to $130.29 in early New York Stock Exchange trading. Other health insurers including Aetna Inc and Anthem Inc are also large players on the exchanges. In recent months they said they will continue to sell exchange plans. The company has 795,000 customers from the exchanges, more than half of them new to UnitedHealth, it said. It expects about 650,000 members by year end.  The government said in February that more than 12 million people had signed up for Obamacare-related insurance through HealthCare.gov or a state-based exchange as of Jan. 31. Previous government expectations had been for more than 20 million people. RAISES 2016 PROFIT OUTLOOK UnitedHealth raised its expectations for 2016 profit, in part because of a more favorable tax rate that also helped it beat Wall Street expectations for the first quarter.Lower sales and administrative costs and a decline in amortization of intangible assets also helped its first quarter results. On an adjusted basis the health insurer earned $1.81 per share, compared with Wall Street analyst expectations for earnings of $1.72 per share, according to ThomsonReuters I/B/E/S.Net profit rose to $1.61 billion, or $1.67 per share, from $1.41 billion or $1.46 per share, a year earlier.

On an adjusted basis the health insurer earned $1.81 per share, compared with Wall Street analyst expectations for earnings of $1.72 per share, according to ThomsonReuters I/B/E/S.Net profit rose to $1.61 billion, or $1.67 per share, from $1.41 billion or $1.46 per share, a year earlier.The company now expects 2016 adjusted net earnings of $7.75-$7.95 per share, up 15 cents per share from its previous estimate.(Reporting by Caroline Humer in New York and Amrutha Penumudi in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta,  Chizu Nomiyama and W Simon)",2016-04-19,UNH,"Tue Apr 19, 2016 | 10:34am EDT",UPDATE 3-UnitedHealth plans to exit Obamacare exchanges,http://www.reuters.com//article/unitedhealth-grp-results-idUSL3N17M38A?type=companyNews

127,"   By Susan Kelly  Tenet Healthcare Corp (THC.N), the third-largest U.S. for-profit hospital operator, expects other insurers to step in and absorb UnitedHealth Group Inc's (UNH.N) share of the exchange market when the largest U.S. health insurance provider exits that business, company executives said on Monday.UnitedHealth, one of the biggest sellers of plans on the exchanges, last month said it would exit the Obamacare individual insurance market in most states next year, citing losses from the program.Tenet's hospitals have seen a boost in business from the influx of newly insured patients who bought coverage through the exchanges, created as part of President Barack Obama's national healthcare law.Daniel Waldmann, Tenet's senior vice president of public affairs, downplayed the impact of UnitedHealth's decision, saying insurers can be expected to make adjustments, as happened when the popular Medicare Advantage managed care plans for seniors were initially introduced. ""You are going to see that. There are others who will be looking to pick up that UnitedHealth business,"" Waldmann told Reuters.Chief Executive Trevor Fetter said Tenet has followed a deliberate strategy to ensure its hospitals are included as in-network choices by insurers on the exchanges, and that effort has generated strong admissions growth. Dallas-based Tenet on Monday reported that admissions to its hospitals of patients insured through the exchanges climbed more than 27 percent in the first quarter compared with a year ago.  ""It is important for us to do everything to make sure the exchanges are viable and successful, and that consumers perceive value and choice in the exchanges,"" Fetter said in an interview.

131,"   By Mark Miller | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Medicare enrollees are moving in greater numbers than ever to the program’s managed care option as a way to save money. But the tradeoff is much less ability to use their preferred doctors and hospitals.Seniors can choose between traditional fee-for-service Medicare - which is accepted by most healthcare providers - or a Medicare Advantage plan. The latter encompasses health maintenance organizations (HMOs) or preferred provider organizations (PPOs), which control costs by creating healthcare provider networks that enrollees must use.In theory, prospective Advantage enrollees can review lists of in-network providers before opting into a plan. But a new study by the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) finds that provider data often is very difficult to review, can be out of date and frequently contain inaccurate information.KFF’s review also found shortcomings in the quality of providers in some Medicare Advantage provider networks. One out of every five plans did not include a regional academic medical center - institutions which usually offer the highest quality care and top specialists. And only 40 percent of Advantage provider networks included top-quality cancer centers, as indicated by membership in the National Cancer Institute’s network.NCI-designated cancer centers offer cutting-edge treatments and tend to have greater access to clinical trials. They are especially important for patients with rare and advanced cancers, or other complicating conditions, said Gretchen Jacobson, KFF’s associate director of the program on Medicare policy and co-author of the study. The upshot: Medicare Advantage may be just fine if you are  healthy, but problems may crop up if your healthcare needs become more complex and you have very specific healthcare provider preferences. This year, 31 percent of Medicare enrollees are in Advantage plans, up from 11 percent in 2010. That number is expected to hit 41 percent by 2026, according to a forecast by the Congressional Budget Office.When Medicare enrollees join Medicare Advantage plans, their Part B premiums continue to be paid to Medicare, which then makes a monthly capitated payment to the Advantage plan. The payment is based on the plan’s estimated cost per enrollee, the plan’s quality rating and the health status of the enrollee.The largest providers are UnitedHealthcare, Humana Inc and Blue Cross Blue Shield. One often hears critics claim that healthcare providers are bailing out of traditional Medicare in large numbers - but that is not actually the case. Last year, 14 percent of Medicare enrollees who were seeking a new primary care doctor reported major problems in finding a physician who would treat them, according to survey data from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, an independent congressional agency. Among those seeking a new specialist, 6 percent reported major problems. In both cases, that represents 1 percent of the total Medicare population. ADVANTAGES, PITFALLS  Advantage plans often offer extra benefits, such as health club memberships, vision care and some limited dental care. Cost-sharing is often lower, and many plans provide prescription drug coverage with no extra premium. “It can be very attractive to many seniors who are living on a fixed budget,” Jacobson said. The trade-off is limited provider networks - and the challenges prospective enrollees face in determining who they are allowed to see for healthcare, and who is off-limits. KFF reviewed 409 Advantage plans, including 307 HMOs and 102 PPOs. Researchers found provider directories often were riddled with errors, omissions and outdated information.“There’s no reason in this era of technology why this needs to be as difficult as it is,” Jacobson said. “People should be able to simply tell the system who their doctors are, the illnesses they have, and get a recommendation for a plan that will work for them.”KFF also found that Advantage provider network quality differs significantly. For example, Los Angeles has three NCI-designated cancer centers. Most of the Advantage plans there do not include any of them, but one plan includes all three.A report last year by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which runs Medicare, needs to improve its oversight of Advantage plans to assure that provider networks are robust. The report also criticized CMS for doing too little to assess the accuracy of Advantage plan provider lists.Even when Advantage enrollees are able to confirm participation by their healthcare providers, there is no guarantee that will continue. Advantage plans are free to add or drop health providers during the course of an enrollment season.  That became an especially hot issue in 2014 when UnitedHealthcare dropped providers who covered thousands of the insurer's patients, including the prominent Yale-New Haven Hospital system.Democrats in Congress have proposed legislation that would prohibit Advantage plans from dropping providers without cause during the middle of an enrollment year.Under current rules, plans must provide 30 days’ notice to enrollees when providers are dropped. Enrollees who lose access to a provider can make a midyear plan change only under very limited circumstances. “You can do it only if you are receiving ongoing care from a provider that is terminated,” Jacobson said. “Otherwise you need to wait until the next open enrollment period.”The annual enrollment period for Advantage and Part D prescription drug plans are held from Oct. 15 to Dec. 7 each year. At that point, a beneficiary could switch to a different Advantage plan, or shift back to traditional Medicare. But a serious diagnosis in January would leave you hamstrung until the following year.Said Jacobson: ""It can be a roll of the dice.""(This version of the July 7 story corrects paragraph 8. An earlier version of this column said that the enrollee's Part B premium ""goes to the insurance company providing the plan"".)

132,"   By Caroline Humer  UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) is still losing money on the individual insurance business created under U.S. President Barack Obama's national healthcare reform law due to customers' high medical costs, the company said on Tuesday.The largest U.S. health insurer said that it was booking $200 million in losses in the second quarter to cover higher-than-anticipated use of medical services by customers this year. UnitedHealth and other insurers have blamed those costs for their losses from the exchange business.The company said it expected the program, often called Obamacare, to reduce 2016 earnings by about $850 million, up from $475 million in 2015.   Next year, it will exit most of the two dozen states where it sells individual insurance on the exchanges but still has plans to sell in Nevada, New York and Virginia.    ""We do not expect any meaningful financial exposure on 2017 business from the three or fewer exchange markets where we currently plan to remain,"" Chief Executive Officer Stephen Hemsley said on a conference call with analysts to discuss second-quarter financial results.  Individual exchange customers this year have more severe chronic conditions, such as diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and HIV, and attrition has been lower than expected, UnitedHealth said. It expects to end 2016 with 750,000 exchange members.The company said its other businesses, including pharmacy benefit management and the technology and consulting divisions, were strong, and it reported higher-than-expected earnings and revenue for the second quarter.UnitedHealth, which also sells employer-based insurance as well as Medicare and Medicaid, raised the low end of its full-year profit outlook to $7.80 per share from $7.75 and kept the high end at $7.95. Shares of UnitedHealth were up 0.5 percent at $141.42.     It is the only large insurer not involved in any of the major consolidation deals under review by antitrust regulators.Other insurers were off slightly on the announcement but lost ground after a report that antitrust regulators were planning to block their deals. Aetna Inc (AET.N) was off 3.6 percent at $114.90, while Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) fell 2.9 percent to $131.11. Cigna Corp (CI.N) was down 2.3 percent at $130.02 and Humana Inc (HUM.N) gave up 5.3 percent to $151.10.Mizuho analyst Sheryl Skolnick said UnitedHealth's Obamacare business could further weigh on 2016 profit, given that more members have stayed on than expected and will have higher expenses during the second half. ""They have tried as much as they can... to take as much of the losses as they can,"" Skolnick said.Revenue from the company's Optum business, which manages drug benefits and offers healthcare data analytics services, rose 51.5 percent to $20.6 billion from a year earlier.Net earnings rose to $1.75 billion, or $1.81 per share, from $1.59 billion, or $1.64 per share, a year earlier.

Jackson was nominated to the bench in 2011 by President Barack Obama, a Democrat.Bates will hear the U.S. Justice Department's challenge to Aetna Inc's (AET.N) purchase of Humana Inc (HUM.N).

This would be bad news for Anthem, which has stressed that it needs a decision by Dec. 31 to wrap up final approval from state regulators by April 30, 2017.Christopher Curran, Anthem's lawyer, said at a hearing on Thursday that the failure to get approvals on time would doom the deal because Cigna would not agree to an extension.

""Anthem is extremely pleased that Judge Bates recognizes in his order Anthem's need for an expedited hearing regarding our acquisition of Cigna and we look forward to an expeditious resolution of the matter,"" the company said in a statement.The change in court assignment came shortly after Bates said in a pretrial hearing on Thursday that it would be difficult for him to decide the Anthem case and Aetna's merger with Humana by the end of the year.Aetna's stock was up 2.5 percent while Humana rose 2.6 percent. Anthem's stock was up less than 1 percent and Cigna's shares were down less than 1 percent.

""Anthem is extremely pleased that Judge Bates recognizes in his order Anthem's need for an expedited hearing regarding our acquisition of Cigna and we look forward to an expeditious resolution of the matter,"" the company said in a statement.The change in court assignment came shortly after Bates said in a pretrial hearing on Thursday that it would be difficult for him to decide the Anthem case and Aetna's merger with Humana by the end of the year.Aetna's stock was up 2.5 percent while Humana rose 2.6 percent. Anthem's stock was up less than 1 percent and Cigna's shares were down less than 1 percent. The U.S. Department of Justice filed lawsuits in July to block the multibillion-dollar mergers, both of which were announced in July 2015. Anthem's planned purchase of Cigna is valued at $45 billion, while Aetna would pay about $33 billion for Humana. If the mergers go through, No. 1 U.S. insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) would rank second after Anthem. Aetna would be No. 3.

142,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, August 10 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed UnitedHealth Group  Incorporated's (UNH) Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A' and its senior unsecured  notes at 'A-'. Fitch has also affirmed the 'AA-' Insurer Financial Strength  ratings of UNH's insurance company subsidiaries. The Rating Outlook remains  Negative. A complete list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS  The affirmation of UNH's ratings reflects the company's leading market position  and significant size and scale as well as solid operating performance from  diverse sources. Balanced against these strengths is the increased financial  leverage associated with the company's acquisition of Catamaran Corporation  (Catamaran). The Negative Outlook reflects uncertainty as to UNH's ability to reduce its  financial leverage to levels more commensurate with the company's current  ratings. UNH's position as the largest U.S. health insurer in terms of total revenues,  GAAP equity and total medical membership could endure as the DOJ challenges  mergers between Aetna Inc. and Humana Inc. as well as Anthem Inc. and Cigna  Corporation. Fitch categorizes UNH as having a 'large' market position and  size/scale under the agency's rating criteria, and companies with this profile  are supportive of the 'AA' category. The company's credit profile also benefits  from significant cash flows derived from subsidiaries whose dividend payments  are generally less heavily regulated than those of health insurers. Financial leverage ratios remain outside Fitch's medians for the current rating  category with UNH's debt-to-EBITDA and debt-to-total capital ratios at 2.4x and  48% as of June 30, 2016, down modestly from year-end 2015 levels of 2.5x and  49%, respectively. Fitch expects a reduction in financial leverage ratios as UNH  moderates share repurchase activity during the second half of 2016. UNH's EBITDA-based interest coverage remained supportive of current ratings at  13.4x based on six month 2016 EBITDA and interest expense. ACA exchange sourced  business continues to be a drag on earnings as UNH's management reported an  expectation to lose approximately $605 million related to the individual ACA  compliant segment for the full year 2016 beyond the $245 million premium  deficiency reserve established in 2015. UNH participated in public exchange  offerings in 34 states during 2016 and has announced its exit from all but three  state exchanges for 2017. UNH's ratings recognize the company's solid operating margins and overall  profitability, as well as the inherent strength and diversity of the company's  health benefits and health services operations. UNH reported an EBITDA margin of  7.9% through the first six months of 2016, down compared with 8.7% for the  comparable period in 2015, reflecting lower margins at Catamaran. UNH's  operating margins are slightly below expectations for the company's current  rating. Annualized return on total capital was 10.1% through the first half of  2016, which remains consistent with both recent results and Fitch's median  guideline for the current rating category. UNH's businesses display great scale and diversity and sources of unregulated  earnings and cash flows have grown steadily over the past several years notably  with the Catamaran acquisition. Catamaran offers retail pharmacy care services  to health plans and employers and provides healthcare information technology  solutions to the pharmacy benefits management industry. The company's Optum  business segment contributed $2.4 billion of pre-tax income in the first six  months of 2016 or more than one-third of total pre-tax income.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that could result in a downgrade include:  --Lack of meaningful progress over the next 12 months towards returning to  historic leverage measures of debt-to-EBITDA and financial leverage ratios  approximating 1.5x and 40%, respectively;  --Material deterioration in NAIC risk-based capital ratio below 225% of the  company action level; --EBITDA-to-interest coverage below 10x.  Key rating triggers that could result in a return to a Stable Outlook include: --Significant progress toward deleveraging targets of debt-to-EBITDA ratio below  1.8x and financial leverage ratio below 41%, while maintaining a double-digit  EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio.

143,"   By Greg Roumeliotis and Alexandria Sage | NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO  NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO U.S. prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation into Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.N) over whether it hid from insurers its relationship with a specialty pharmacy that helped boost its drug sales, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.    Lawyers at the U.S. Attorney's Manhattan office are trying to gauge whether concealing those ties may have amounted to defrauding insurers, the Journal report said, citing people familiar with the matter.A source familiar with the matter told Reuters later on Wednesday that investigators have been looking into what disclosures Valeant and the pharmacy, Philidor Rx Services, made to insurance companies about their relationship.    U.S.-listed shares of Valeant (VRX.TO) (VRX.N), which is headquartered in Canada, slid 12.5 percent to $23.90 in extended trading. The troubled company has seen its market value fall by some 90 percent in the last year as its drug pricing and other business practices prompted investigations by multiple U.S. government agencies and by Congress.     It first came under scrutiny from New York prosecutors last October over its drug pricing and distribution. Media also reported at the time that it used Philidor to overcome insurer rejections to reimbursing its medications, with Philidor resubmitting claims to insurers until they were approved.     Valeant said in a statement on Wednesday that it was continuing to cooperate with the U.S. Attorney's Office in New York regarding the investigation that was disclosed last October. The company did not provide further details on the subject of the probe.     ""Valeant takes these matters seriously and intends to uphold the highest standards of ethical conduct as we move forward with our mission to improve people's lives with our healthcare products,"" the company said.     The investigation by U.S. prosecutors could lead to criminal charges against former Philidor executives and Valeant as a company, the Journal report said, citing one person familiar with the matter. (on.wsj.com/2aMvQwS)         Officials at the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan and representatives for Philidor, which closed its operations, were not immediately available for comment on the Journal report.             SURPRISE DISCLOSURE     The October revelation of Valeant's ties to Philidor took investors by surprise. Following media reports of a relationship between the two, the drugmaker disclosed at the time that Philidor accounted for nearly 6 percent of its revenue and that it had an option to acquire the pharmacy, an unusual relationship in the pharmaceutical industry.    Reuters and other media outlets reported on how Philidor helped secure insurer reimbursement for Valeant drugs. In some circumstances, the pharmacy would resubmit claims using the billing identification numbers of other affiliated pharmacies until an insurer approved payment, according to former employees.  A small group of Valeant employees were deeply involved in directing Philidor's daily operations, raising questions about how much the drugmaker's executives knew of its practices, Reuters reported at the time.     At least one payer, the pharmacy benefits manager OptumRx owned by UnitedHealth Group (UNH.N), became aware of what appeared to be irregular billing practices and sought to shut out Philidor from its network. After Valeant's ties to Philidor became public, other payers cut off the pharmacy and it subsequently closed.      Valeant has taken a series of steps to restore investor trust, including cutting off ties with Philidor last October, conducting an internal review of that relationship, replacing Chief Executive Michael Pearson, overhauling its board of directors and appointing new leaders to run its main businesses.  Billionaire investor William Ackman, whose Pershing Square Capital Management is Valeant's largest shareholder, has taken a board seat to influence efforts to clean up the business. New management, led by CEO Joseph Papa, has sought to move beyond the questions over its Philidor ties. Ackman declined to comment.Valeant is also under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange and U.S. prosecutors in Massachusetts.

144,"   By Diane Bartz | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The judge overseeing the U.S. Justice Department's bid to stop health insurer Anthem (ANTM.N) from merging with competitor Cigna (CI.N) said on Friday her goal was to have a ruling by the end of January, later than the Dec. 30 date sought by Anthem.Anthem had sought a ruling by the end of the year on whether the government could stop the deal because the insurer said it needed time to wrap up merger reviews by state insurance commissioners by April 30, a deadline the companies set to complete the deal. Anthem has said failure to meet the deadline could prompt Cigna to pull out.In a brief order issued late on Friday, Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia set a trial date for Nov. 21, with a conclusion by Dec. 30. She gave the government 10 days to present its case and gave Anthem six days.The judge said in a pre-trial hearing on Friday morning that she expected a decision in January. ""My current thinking is that I'm going to aim for a decision by the end of January,"" she said.Cigna is unlikely to agree to extend the April 30 deadline because of the two companies' contentious relationship, a lawyer for Anthem said last week.  The Justice Department filed lawsuits on July 21 asking a federal court to stop two huge healthcare mergers: Anthem's planned $45 billion purchase of Cigna, as well as Aetna (AET.N) Inc's $33 billion planned acquisition of Humana (HUM.N). The trial on the Aetna deal is set for Dec. 5.Anthem's lawyer, Christopher Curran, indicated during the hearing that the company was most concerned about reviews on the merger in Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia and New Hampshire. During the hearing, lawyers for the Justice Department and Anthem both said they were willing to discuss a settlement but neither indicated that talks were ongoing.""There is absolutely a willingness"" to hold settlement discussions, said the Justice Department's Jon Jacobs, who added, however, that any proposed remedy would take time to evaluate.Anthem's Curran said the company ""stands ready"" to discuss a settlement. The Justice Department argues that the deals would reduce competition, raise prices for consumers and stifle innovation if the number of large, national insurers fell from five to three.If both mergers go through, No. 1 U.S. insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) would rank second after Anthem.

148,"  NEW YORK Aetna Inc, the No. 3 U.S. health insurer, on Monday said that due to persistent financial losses on Obamacare plans, it will sell individual insurance on the government-run online marketplaces in only four states next year, down from the current 15 states.Aetna's decision follows similar moves from UnitedHealth Group Inc. and Humana Inc., which have cited similar concerns about financial losses on these exchanges created under President Barack Obama's national healthcare reform law.Aetna is also trying to buy Humana and is currently fighting a U.S. government lawsuit aimed at blocking the $34 billion deal.Aetna, which earlier this year said it was too soon to give up on the exchanges despite its challenges, this month signaled it was reconsidering. On Aug. 2, the company said it would not expand in 2017 and would review all its individual business.Many insurers last year had said they expected to profit on the exchanges, but now say more exchange rules must be changed for it to be sustainable. Only about 11 million people have signed up through the exchanges, about half as many as expected.Larry Levitt, healthcare economist at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said that if enrollment stagnates, small technical fixes likely will not be enough to bring big insurers back. ""More healthy people need to be encouraged to sign up,"" Levitt said by email.  Aetna said that the current risk adjustment system, in which the government balances out the costs of sicker than typical populations through payments to insurers, is not adequate. Aetna said that it had a second-quarter pretax loss of $200 million on the individual business and has lost $430 million since the plans first went on sale in 2014. Kevin Counihan, Chief Executive of the U.S. government-run individual marketplace, said that the risks of the customer pool is improving. ""It’s no surprise that companies are adapting at different rates to a market where they compete for business on cost and quality rather than by denying coverage to people with preexisting conditions,"" Counihan said in a statement.Aetna on Monday said it would continue to sell plans on the exchanges in Delaware, Iowa, Nebraska and Virginia in 2017. The plans, which are eligible for income-based government subsidies, will be sold in 242 counties, down from 778 counties this year. States it is exiting include Florida and Ohio. It will continue to sell individual plans that meet the law's requirements - such as not denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions - outside of the exchanges where it does now, the company said.

151,"  Sept 21 UnitedHealth Group Inc, the largest U.S. health insurer, will stop covering several brand-name drugs as of next year, reinforcing a trend of payers steering prescriptions to lower-priced options.In a bulletin seeking client feedback by Sept. 28, UnitedHealth said it is changing reimbursement terms for long-acting insulins and will no longer cover Lantus, the main insulin drug sold by Sanofi SA.The insurer said Basaglar, a cheaper biosimilar insulin sold by Eli Lilly & Co would be covered as ""Tier 1,"" meaning the lowest out-of-pocket costs for members. Levemir, produced by Novo Nordisk A/S, will move from Tier 1 to Tier 2. Biosimilars are cheaper copies of protein-based biotech drugs such as Lantus, which are no longer protected by patents. They cannot be precisely replicated like conventional chemical drugs but have been shown to be equivalent in terms of efficacy and side effects. The insurer also said it will exclude from coverage Amgen Inc's white blood cell-boosting drug Neupogen, in favor of Zarxio, a biosimilar sold by Novartis AG. UnitedHealth last year bought Catamaran Corp for $12.8 billion, making it the nation's No. 3 pharmacy benefit manager after Express Scripts Holding Co and Caremark, which is owned by CVS Health Corp.

156,"   By Brendan Pierson  UnitedHealth Group Inc has been sued by three customers who accused the largest U.S. health insurer of charging co-payments for prescription drugs that were higher than their actual cost and pocketing the difference.The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in federal court in Minnesota by three UnitedHealth customers, seeks to represent a nationwide class that it says could include ""tens of thousands"" of people insured by UnitedHealth.The lawsuit said Minnesota-based UnitedHealth and affiliated companies charged customers co-payments for drugs that were significantly higher than prices it negotiated with pharmacies for those drugs. For example, the lawsuit claims, one class member paid a $50 co-payment for Sprintec, a contraceptive, while UnitedHealth paid the pharmacy only $11.65. The pharmacy was then required to hand the extra $38.85 over to UnitedHealth under its agreement with the insurer, the lawsuit said. The lawsuit claims that such a co-payment ""is not a 'co-' payment for a prescription drug because the insurer is paying nothing,"" but is instead ""a hidden additional premium.""The lawsuit says UnitedHealth has hidden this practice from its customers, forcing them to overpay for a wide variety of common, low-cost drugs. The lawsuit claims UnitedHealth's co-payments violate the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), a federal law used to target illegal conspiracies, and in some cases also violate a federal law governing employee benefit plans.UnitedHealth spokesman Matt Wiggin said in an email that the company had not yet been served with the complaint, and that ""pharmacy benefits are administered in line with the coverage described in the plan documents.""",2016-10-05,UNH,"Wed Oct 5, 2016 | 5:40pm EDT",Customers sue UnitedHealth over prescription drug co-pay costs,http://www.reuters.com//article/unitedhealth-lawsuit-idUSL2N1CB27J?type=companyNews

168,"   By Ankur Banerjee  Health insurer Cigna Corp (CI.N) said on Thursday it would not expand its individual Obamacare plans into more states next year, joining an industry pullback from the struggling business.Cigna, which manages insurance plans for big companies and sells health plans on the government exchanges created under Obamacare, had planned to expand into 10 states from seven.Insurers including Aetna Inc (AET.N), UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) and Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) - which has agreed to buy Cigna - say they are losing money on the exchanges because of lower-than-anticipated enrollments. Enrollees are also sicker and older than expected, the companies say.UnitedHealth and Aetna will leave the exchanges in 2017.The U.S. government has moved to block the Cigna-Anthem deal, saying it would stifle competition.Shares of Cigna, which reported a better-than-expected third-quarter profit, were up 0.4 percent at $118.32. Anthem on Wednesday raised the prospect of smaller participation in the exchanges in 2018, saying it would have a market-by-market strategy that hinges on 2017 profitability.President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, created online exchanges where consumers can shop for individual health insurance and get subsidies.""We're continuing to plan for a loss in the (individual Obamacare) business,"" Cigna Chief Executive David Cordani said in a call with analysts, adding that there would still be ""some revenue growth."" Cigna's commercial medical loss ratio - the amount it spends on medical claims compared to income from premiums - rose slightly to 79.4 percent in the quarter ended Sept. 30.However, its government medical loss ratio rose to 85.3 percent from 83.6 percent a year earlier.Investors would likely be relieved by Cigna's report as there were no major signs of additional weakness, Barclays analysts wrote in a client note. Cigna said its net income fell 16.6 percent to $456 million, or $1.76 per share, in the quarter.Excluding items, the company earned $1.94 per share, topping analysts' average estimate of $1.91, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.    Operating revenue rose 4.5 percent to $9.81 billion, just shy of the $9.83 billion analysts had expected.Up to Wednesday's close, Cigna's stock had fallen 19.5 percent this year, compared with a 7.5 percent slide in the S&P 500 Managed Healthcare index .SPLRCHMO.

170,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Healthcare stocks, including insurers, have jumped since Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election last week and some hedge fund managers may see further gains in after making new bets in the sector in the third quarter.Billionaire investor Daniel Loeb's Third Point portfolio  invested in insurer Humana Inc during the third quarter, according to the latest 13F hedge fund filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Loeb's hedge fund bought 1.4 million shares of Humana.John Paulson's Paulson & Co., whose investments have been followed closely ever since his successful bet against the housing market, also took a new position in Humana, buying 79,500 shares. Pointstate Capital put on a new position as well, buying 991,622 shares. At Glenview Capital Management, where Humana was already the biggest investment, the firm raised its holdings by 9.0 percent.  Diamond Hill Capital, Samlyn Capital, P. Schoenfeld Asset Management and Clovis Capital Management also made new bets on the insurer, although they were far smaller, according to regulatory filings that show what U.S. stocks investment managers owned on Sept. 30.Over the last six weeks, Humana has been one of the sector's best performers, boasting a 12.16 percent gain since Sept. 30. Since January, the stock has gained 11 percent, handily outperforming the S&P 500's 6 percent gain.Some insurers including UnitedHealth Group Inc and Anthem Inc had said they are losing money on the healthcare exchanges created by President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act. With Donald Trump vowing to overturn the law, UnitedHealth and Anthem have also posted strong gains since the end of the third quarter. Anthem has climbed 10.5 percent in the last six weeks with UnitedHealth gaining 9 percent and Aetna Inc posting a 7.5 percent rise.Glenview Capital boosted its Anthem bet by 41 percent while Hotchkis & Wiley Capital Management and Cornerstone Advisors Inc also each raised their stakes. Vulcan Value Partners and Two Sigma Investments increased their bets on UnitedHealth.Most investment managers released their 13-F filings on Monday and while the information is backward looking, it is watched closely by investors for hints of upcoming trends. The filings also reveal which managers made moves, identifying by name the investors who may have been behind big gyrations. Not all investors stuck with the health insurers, however, with a good number trimming their investments in the run-up to the U.S. election on November 8. With most polls calling for Hillary Clinton to win the White House, some investors were concerned she could impose greater regulation on drug companies and curb their price hikes.Hedge fund Adage trimmed its bet on Humana but held onto 1.1 million shares. Arrowgrass Capital Partners cut its bet by nearly half but still owned 1.9 million shares. And Farallon Capital Management, founded by Tom Steyer, cut its position by 45 percent to 382,000 shares.Similarly, shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals, which drew Clinton's ire during the campaign for enormous price hikes, continue to drop in the last weeks amid fears about its debt load. Mutual fund powerhouse Fidelity Investments cut its Valeant stake by more than half.   But with Trump heading to the White House in January, a number of investors said healthcare stocks, which had been undervalued, could now be poised for robust gains.Since the end of September, biotech company Celgene, whose blockbuster cancer drug Revlimid helped boost earnings, has gained 15.4 percent, making it the sector's top performer.Two Sigma boosted its investment by 200 percent to own 177 million shares.    Carl Icahn, the activist investor, sold most of his shares in Allergan Plc just a few months after Pfizer walked away from a plan to merge with the company. Even in the second quarter, a number of investors had trimmed their holdings in Allergan.

The healthcare index was up 0.8 percent.

The Nasdaq Biotech index was up 0.9 percent.But with market having already registered strong gains since the Nov. 8 U.S. election, analysts expect some of the bullish momentum to slow.
