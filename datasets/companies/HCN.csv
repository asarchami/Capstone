4,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, August 13 (Fitch) The announcement by Health Care REIT, Inc. (NYSE:  HCN, Fitch IDR of 'BBB', Outlook Stable) that it will acquire HealthLease  Properties Real Estate Investment Trust for $950 million is credit neutral, in  Fitch's  view. HCN's strong liquidity position and track record as a capital  provider in the healthcare real estate sector should continue to drive accretive  acquisition opportunities, which Fitch views positively. Additionally, the 60%  equity and 40% debt financing mix will preserve credit metrics, with pro forma  leverage of 5.9x, which is appropriate for the 'BBB' rating, and fixed-charge  coverage of approximately 3.0x, relatively strong for the rating.  These credit positives are balanced by broader concerns about event risk in the  healthcare REIT sector. This stems from vast issuer growth over the past several  years - 'The Big 3' have average enterprise values of nearly $30 billion - thus  requiring large transactions to 'move the earnings needle' via external growth.  This dynamic may also drive REITs to employ higher leverage levels or pursue  higher yielding assets (i.e. lower quality) to make transactions accretive. On Aug. 13, 2014, HCN announced that it will acquire HealthLease Properties Real  Estate Investment Trust (TSX: HLP.UN) for $950 million at an initial 7% cash  yield. HCN also entered into a partnership with Mainstreet Property Group,  HealthLease's external manager, by which HCN will acquire 17 communities managed  by various operators under long-term triple-net lease agreements. Health Care  REIT will acquire the pipeline for approximately $369 million, representing a  7.5% initial cash yield, and is expected to close in tranches upon completion of  construction beginning in 4Q'14 through 1Q'16.  HCN will also provide mezzanine financing to Mainstreet and receive purchase  rights at HCN's option for an additional 45 development projects managed under  long-term triple-net lease agreements. This pipeline represents $1 billion and a  7.7% initial cash yield. The future pipeline is anticipated to close in tranches  upon completion of construction beginning in 2016 through 1Q'17. In total, the  transaction represents a potential $2.3 billion investment at 7.4% blended  initial cash yield. The initial HealthLease portfolio consists of 53 communities with 5,331 beds  comprised of 46% seniors housing, 30% post-acute care, and 24% long-term care.  The average remaining lease term is approximately 11 years and features 2%  annual rent escalators, which together with favorable pricing on the acquisition  pipeline, should insulate HCN's credit metrics from any uptick in interest  rates. The properties are well-diversified across the United States (roughly  two-thirds of the portfolio) and Canada (one-third) and 30 of the 53 communities  were built since 2010. Operators include Trilogy Health Services, Life Care  Services and Saber Healthcare, and two Canadian operators, Continuum Healthcare  and AgeCare. The transaction is expected to close in 4Q'14.

5,"   By Anand Basu  Health Care REIT Inc said it would buy Canada's HealthLease Properties Real Estate Investment Trust in a deal valued at $950 million, including debt, to expand its presence in senior housing and post-acute care segments.The acquisition is the latest in a series of deals as healthcare real estate companies look to take advantage of rising demand for senior care facilities in a consolidating sector.Analysts said Health Care's offer fairly valued HealthLease.They said chances of a rival bid were slim as it would be difficult to outbid Health Care, one of the largest U.S. healthcare real estate companies. ""HealthLease has a solid growth business model, but it would have required a lot of equity to get to the point to justify the $14.20 target price,"" National Bank Financial analyst Matt Kornack told Reuters.In June, Health Care's rival Ventas Inc said it would buy American Realty Capital Healthcare Trust Inc for about $2.6 billion.NorthStar Realty Finance Corp said earlier this month it would acquire Griffin-American Healthcare REIT II Inc for $3.35 billion. DEAL TERMS Health Care said the deal would add to its portfolio more than 5,000 beds or units in North Carolina and Indiana in the United States and Alberta in Canada.  The company offered C$14.20 ($13) in cash for each HealthLease share, which represents a premium of 31 percent to HealthLease's Tuesday closing.The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2014 and add 4 cents per share to Health Care's earnings in the first year after the transaction closes, the company said on Wednesday. Health Care also said it was partnering with HealthLease's largest shareholder, Mainstreet Property Group, to acquire 17 projects managed by well-known operators under long-term lease agreements.Health Care's shares were up 2.4 percent at $65.05 on the New York Stock Exchange in noon trading.  HealthLease's shares rose 31 percent to C$14.18 on the Toronto Stock Exchange, near the offer price.Goldman Sachs & Co and RBC Capital Markets were Health Care's financial advisers for the deal, while BMO Capital Markets advised HealthLease. Sidley Austin LLP, Borden Ladner Gervais LLP and Shumaker, Loop & Kendrick LLP were Health Care's legal advisers and Goodmans LLP advised HealthLease.

The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2014 and add 4 cents per share to Health Care's earnings in the first year after the transaction closes, the company said on Wednesday.Health Care also said it was partnering with HealthLease's largest shareholder, Mainstreet Property Group, to acquire 17 projects managed by well-known operators under long-term lease agreements.Health Care's shares were up 2.4 percent at $65.05 on the New York Stock Exchange in noon trading.HealthLease's shares rose 31 percent to C$14.18 on the Toronto Stock Exchange, near the offer price.Goldman Sachs & Co and RBC Capital Markets were Health Care's financial advisers for the deal, while BMO Capital Markets advised HealthLease.Sidley Austin LLP, Borden Ladner Gervais LLP and Shumaker, Loop & Kendrick LLP were Health Care's legal advisers and Goodmans LLP advised HealthLease.

13,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, March 06 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has upgraded the credit ratings for  Health Care REIT, Inc. (NYSE: HCN) as follows: --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'BBB+' from 'BBB'; --$2.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility to 'BBB+' from 'BBB'; --$715.5 million senior unsecured term loans to 'BBB+' from 'BBB'; --$6.9 billion senior unsecured notes to 'BBB+' from 'BBB'; --$216 million senior unsecured convertible notes to 'BBB+' from 'BBB'; --$1 billion preferred stock to 'BBB-' from 'BB+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The upgrade of HCN's IDR to 'BBB+' reflects the company's significant  de-leveraging over the past year beyond Fitch's previous expectations to levels  appropriate for a 'BBB+' rated diversified healthcare REIT, and sustained cash  flows in excess of fixed charges from a portfolio in markets with strong  demographics and derived principally from private pay sources. Notably, HCN's  SSNOI growth has exceeded that of its two major peers, HCP, Inc. (HCP, IDR of  'BBB+' with a Stable Outlook) and Ventas, Inc. (VTR, IDR of 'BBB+' with a Stable  Outlook) with less volatility, despite higher levels of NOI derived from REIT  Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act (RIDEA) structured investments.  Credit strengths include strong access to capital and a deep management team.  Credit concerns center on sub-1.0x liquidity coverage as of Dec. 31, 2014 pro  forma for announced first quarter 2015 (1Q'2015) investments, the potential for  higher volatility in operating cash flows given RIDEA investments  through-the-cycle and Fitch's broader worries concerning the healthcare REIT  sector's continued rapid growth and the risk that companies in the sector may  end up paying premium pricing for new investments, given favorable equity  valuations. Leverage Reduction The company issued $3.6 billion in common stock in three follow-on equity  offerings in May 2014, September 2014 and February 2015, using the proceeds to  fund the acquisition of the outstanding units of HealthLease Properties Real  Estate Investment Trust and other investments, along with debt repayment. The  company's leverage ratio was 5.3x as of Dec. 31, 2014 pro forma for the most  recent equity offering and $2.2 billion of investments expected to closed in  1Q2015 (pro forma), down from 6.6x and 6.0x as of Dec. 31, 2013 and Dec. 31,  2012, respectively.  Fitch projects leverage to rise to around 5.5x over the next several years  assuming blended 2.5% to 3% same-store NOI growth and future investments with a  split of 40% debt and 60% equity and/or proceeds from asset sales. Moreover,  HCN's capitalization and key credit metrics are generally consistent with those  of its closest peers, HCP and VTR.  In a stress case not anticipated by Fitch in which the company achieves lower  same store NOI growth over the next several years and lower proceeds from equity  offerings and/or asset sales, leverage would approach 6.0x, which would be weak  yet still appropriate for the 'BBB+' rating. Fitch defines leverage as debt less  readily available cash divided by recurring operating EBITDA including recurring  cash distributions from unconsolidated entities. Mainly Private Pay Portfolio Focused Strong Demographic Areas Approximately 34.9% of the company's annualized NOI is from RIDEA seniors  housing operating assets, followed by triple net seniors housing at 26.7%,  skilled nursing/post-acute at 21.6% and medical office at 15.6%. HCN's seniors  housing operating assets also have favorable operating metrics such as higher  revenues generated per occupied room (REVPOR) per month at the company's seniors  housing properties of $6,479 versus the U.S. at $4,365 and are located in  markets with above average house values. HCN derived 87.1% of its revenue from  private pay sources as of Dec. 31, 2014, limiting relative government  reimbursement risk, which Fitch views favorably.  Cash Flow Consistency Despite RIDEA Exposure Fitch views RIDEA structured seniors housing as having the potential for higher  volatility through the cycle than other healthcare property types. Although  HCN's portfolio exhibited less volatility with higher growth than its peers from  2010 - 2014 despite deriving a larger percentage of NOI from RIDEA, this has  been achieved during a period of strong fundamentals. HCN's portfolio may  exhibit more volatility due to supply/demand imbalances. Fitch attributes this  recent outperformance to the strong portfolio demographic information noted  above. Approximately 87.5% of HCN's NOI is derived from U.S. assets, followed by  Canada at 5.3% and United Kingdom at 7.2%, with non-U.S. assets focused on  private pay. The company's fixed charge coverage ratio was 3.5x in 4Q pro forma (3.1x for  full year 2014), up from 2.8x in 2013 and 2.6x in 2012. HCN's lower cost of debt  capital, same-store NOI growth and NOI from development, offset by NOI  reductions from disposed assets, led to the improvement. Fitch projects  fixed-charge coverage in the low 3.0x range over the next several years,  appropriate for a 'BBB+' rating. Fitch defines fixed charge coverage as  recurring operating less straight-line rents and recurring capital expenditures,  divided by total cash interest incurred and preferred dividends. Strong Access to Capital The company has demonstrated strong access to multiple sources of capital,  having issued nearly $9 billion in fixed income securities since 2006, including  U.S. dollar and British Sterling denominated bonds and preferred equity. Since  2006, the company also issued approximately $13.9 billion in common equity at a  weighted average premium to mean consensus net asset value of 25.6% per SNL  Financial. In July 2014, the company entered into a new $3.23 billion unsecured  credit facility consisting of a $2.5 billion revolver, a $500 million term loan  and a CAD 250 million term loan. The $3.23 billion facility replaced the  company's previous credit facilities of approximately $2.98 billion, improving  the company's liquidity position. Deep Management Team Focused on Relationship Investing Thomas J. DeRosa was appointed Chief Executive Officer in April 2014, succeeding  George L. Chapman. DeRosa has served on HCN's Board for 10 years and the other  five members of the company's Management Committee have experience with HCN and  in the industry and ranging from 10 to 29 years.  The management team focuses on a model that encourages connectivity across  property managers and operators. As of Dec. 31, 2014, approximately 17.6% of  HCN's investments were operated by Sunrise Senior Living, followed by Genesis  Healthcare at 11.3%, Brookdale Senior Living at 5.7%, Benchmark Senior Living at  3.7%, and Revera and Senior Lifestyle, both at 3.5%. Connectivity is emphasized  through partner working group discussions and other forums, and manifests in  operating cost synergies, lower capital expenditures and repeat business with  managers/operators. Liquidity Coverage Negatively Impacted by Mainstreet Investment Pipeline Liquidity coverage, calculated as liquidity sources divided by uses, is 0.9x for  the period Jan. 1, 2015 to Dec. 31, 2016. Sources of liquidity include  unrestricted cash, availability under the company's unsecured credit facility  pro forma for the announced 1Q'2015 investments and February equity offering,  and projected retained cash flows from operating activities after dividends.  Uses of liquidity include debt maturities and projected development costs,  including to-be-completed development and $369 million of costs related to the  Mainstreet investment pipeline beginning in 2016 through 1Q'2017. As of Dec. 31,  2014 pro forma for announced 1Q2015 investments, the company had 4.2% of debt  maturing in 2015, 8.7% in 2016 and 6.5% in 2017. HCN's unencumbered assets (unencumbered NOI based on a stressed 8.5%  capitalization rate) divided by net unsecured debt of 2.3x, which is adequate  for a 'BBB+' rating. In addition, organic liquidity has improved, as the  company's AFFO payout ratio was 86.9% in 2014, down from 91.1% in 2013 and 95.2%  in 2012. Based on the 2014 payout ratio, the company retains approximately $135  million of operating cash flow annually. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions for HCN in Fitch's base case include: --3% blended same-store NOI growth for 2015, followed by a moderation to 2.5%  growth in 2016 and 2% in 2017; --CapEx and G&A grow to maintain historical recurring operating EBITDA margins; --$3.5 billion in acquisitions in 2015 (of which $2.2 billion has already been  announced) followed by $2 billion annually in 2016-2017 with yields ranging from  6.5%-7% funded with 40% debt and 60% equity and proceeds from asset sales; --Debt repayment with the issuance of new unsecured bonds. Preferred Stock Notching The two-notch differential between HCN's IDR and preferred stock rating is  consistent with Fitch's criteria for corporate entities with an IDR of 'BBB+'.  Based on Fitch research titled 'Treatment and Notching of Hybrids in  Nonfinancial Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis', these preferred securities are  deeply subordinated and have loss absorption elements that would likely result  in poor recoveries in the event of a corporate default. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may result in positive momentum on the ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.5x (pro forma leverage was  5.3x); --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 4.0x (pro forma  fixed charge coverage was 3.5x); --Fitch's expectation of unencumbered asset coverage of unsecured debt (UA/UD)  at a stressed 8.5% capitalization rate sustaining above 4.0x (pro forma UA/UD is  2.3x). The following factors may result in negative momentum on the ratings and/or  Outlook: --Increased cash flow volatility through the cycle due to heightened RIDEA  exposure and/or a material increase in RIDEA exposure; --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 6.0x; --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining below 3.0x; --Fitch's expectation of liquidity coverage sustaining below 1.0x.

18,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, November 20 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB+' rating to the  CAD300 million of 3.35% senior unsecured notes due 2020 issued by HCN Canadian  Holdings-1 LP. The issuer is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Welltower Inc. (NYSE:  HCN, 'BBB+') and the notes are unconditionally guaranteed. The notes were priced  at 99.74% of par to yield 3.407% to maturity. A full list of Fitch's current  ratings on HCN follows at the end of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS HCN's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'BBB+' reflects the company's leverage,  which is appropriate for a diversified healthcare REIT, and sustained cash flows  in excess of fixed charges from a portfolio in markets with strong demographics  and derived principally from private pay sources. Credit strengths include  strong access to capital and a deep management team. Credit concerns center on  the potential for higher volatility in operating cash flows given REIT  Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act (RIDEA) structured investments  through-the-cycle and Fitch's broader worries concerning the healthcare REIT  sector's rapid growth and the risk that companies in the sector may end up  paying premium pricing for new investments or incurring higher leverage given  the current cost of equity.  LOWER LEVERAGE; FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS TO MODERATE Fitch projects leverage will remain around 5.5x over the next several years  assuming blended 2.5% to 3% same store net operating income (SSNOI) growth and  future investments with a split of 40% debt/60% equity and/or proceeds from  asset sales. Leverage in the mid-5x range is down from the 6x-7.7x levels  reported for the years ended 2010-2013, though these levels were influenced by  the timing of acquisition closings.  In a stress case not anticipated by Fitch in which the company achieves lower  SSNOI growth over the next several years and lower proceeds from equity  offerings and/or asset sales, leverage would approach 6x, which would be weak  yet still appropriate for the 'BBB+' rating. Fitch defines leverage as debt less  readily available cash divided by recurring operating EBITDA including recurring  cash distributions from unconsolidated entities. Similar to leverage metrics, Fitch projects HCN's fixed-charge coverage (FCC)  will maintain in the low-3x range over the next several years, which is  appropriate for the rating. FCC was 3.3x for the trailing 12 months (TTM) ended  Sept. 30, 2015. Fitch defines FCC as recurring operating less straight-line  rents and recurring capital expenditures, divided by total cash interest  incurred and preferred dividends. FOCUSING ON PRIVATE-PAY, LOWER COST SETTINGS; HIGHER RIDEA RISK HCN's investment thesis focuses on reducing reimbursement risk exposure (private  pay comprised 87% of third quarter 2015 facility revenue mix) and  focusing on lower cost settings, which Fitch views favorably. However, as a  result, HCN's largest segment has been RIDEA seniors housing operating assets  which made up 35.1% of 3Q15 NOI, followed by triple net seniors housing at 28.4%  and skilled nursing/post-acute at 20.9%.  Fitch views RIDEA structured seniors housing as having the potential for higher  volatility through the cycle than other healthcare property types. While Fitch  acknowledges the strength of HCN's RIDEA performance to-date, it has not been  proven through cycles as the investments were largely made in recent years after  the changes in RIDEA regulations allowed for the investments. Operating  fundamentals over the past few years have been largely accommodative but have  been slowing from high single-digit growth rates to 2.7% for 3Q15 over 3Q'14.  APPROPRIATE LIQUIDITY & STRONG ACCESS TO CAPITAL Fitch views HCN as having demonstrated strong access to multiple sources of  capital across markets and types including in the United States, United Kingdom  and Canada. HCN's primary source of liquidity is its $2.5 billion unsecured  revolving credit facility due 2018 with a one-year extension option. The  facility had full availability at Sept. 30, 2015 after the receipt of net  proceeds from the CAD issuance and bore interest at LIBOR + 92.5bps. Debt  maturities are generally well-staggered through 2018 when 7%-8% matures per  year. Fitch projects HCN's sources of liquidity cover its uses by 1.5x and 1.1x for  the periods Oct. 1, 2015 through Dec. 31, 2016 and Dec. 31, 2017, respectively  pro forma for the note issuance. Sources of liquidity include unrestricted cash,  availability under the company's unsecured credit facility pro forma, and  projected retained cash flows from operating activities after dividends. Uses of  liquidity include debt maturities, recurring maintenance capital expenditures,  projected development costs and announced investments. HCN's unencumbered assets provided sufficient contingent liquidity to unsecured  bondholders. Assuming a stressed capitalization rate of 8.5%, unencumbered  assets covered unsecured debt by 2.6x as of Sept. 30, 2015  PREFERRED STOCK NOTCHING The two-notch differential between HCN's IDR and preferred stock rating is  consistent with Fitch's criteria for corporate entities with an IDR of 'BBB+'.  Based on Fitch research titled 'Treatment and Notching of Hybrids in  Nonfinancial Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis', these preferred securities are  deeply subordinated and have loss absorption elements that would likely result  in poor recoveries in the event of a corporate default. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions for HCN in our base case include: --3% blended SSNOI growth for 2015, followed by a moderation to 2.5% growth in  2016 and 2% in 2017; --Capex and G&A grow to maintain historical recurring operating EBITDA margins; --$3.5 billion in acquisitions in 2015 followed by $2 billion annually in  2016-2017 with yields ranging from 6.5%-7% funded with 40% debt and 60% equity  and proceeds from asset sales; --Debt repayment with the issuance of new unsecured bonds. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may result in positive momentum for the ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.5x (leverage was 5.5x at  Sept. 30, 2015); --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 4x (fixed charge  coverage was 3.3x for the TTM); --Fitch's expectation of unencumbered asset coverage of unsecured debt at a  stressed 8.5% capitalization rate sustaining above 4x (UA/UD was 2.6x at Sept.  30, 2015). The following factors may result in negative momentum for the ratings and/or  Outlook: --Increased cash flow volatility through the cycle due to heightened RIDEA  exposure and/or a material increase in RIDEA exposure; --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 6x; --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining below 3x; --Fitch's expectation of liquidity coverage sustaining below 1x.

19,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, February 24 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB+' rating to the  $700 million of 4.25% senior unsecured notes due 2026 issued by Welltower Inc.  (NYSE: HCN, 'BBB+'). A full list of Fitch's current ratings on HCN follows at  the end of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS HCN's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'BBB+' reflects the company's leverage,  which is appropriate for a diversified healthcare REIT, and sustained cash flows  in excess of fixed charges from a portfolio in markets with strong demographics  and derived principally from private pay sources.

LOWER LEVERAGE; FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS TO MODERATE Fitch projects leverage will remain between 5.5x-6x over the next several years  assuming blended 2.5% to 3% same store net operating income (SSNOI) growth and  future investments with a split of 40% debt/60% equity and/or proceeds from  asset sales. Leverage in the mid-5x range is down from the 6x-7.7x levels  reported for the years ended 2010-2013, though these levels were influenced by  the timing of acquisition closings. Fitch calculates leverage was 5.7x and 6x  for 4Q15 and 2015, respectively.  In a stress case not anticipated by Fitch in which the company achieves lower  SSNOI growth over the next several years and lower proceeds from equity  offerings and/or asset sales, leverage would approach 6x, which would be weak  yet still appropriate for the 'BBB+' rating. Fitch defines leverage as debt less  readily available cash divided by recurring operating EBITDA including recurring  cash distributions from unconsolidated entities. Similar to leverage metrics, Fitch projects HCN's fixed-charge coverage (FCC)  will maintain in the low-3x range over the next several years, which is  appropriate for the rating. FCC was 3.4x as of Dec. 31, 2015. Fitch defines FCC  as recurring operating less straight-line rents and recurring capital  expenditures, divided by total cash interest incurred and preferred dividends. FOCUSING ON PRIVATE-PAY, LOWER COST SETTINGS; HIGHER RIDEA RISK HCN's investment thesis focuses on reducing reimbursement risk exposure (private  pay comprised 89% of 2015 facility revenue mix) and focusing on lower cost  settings, which Fitch views favorably. However, as a result, HCN's largest  segment has been RIDEA seniors housing operating assets which made up 35.6% of  4Q15 NOI, followed by triple net seniors housing at 28% and skilled  nursing/post-acute at 21%.  Fitch views RIDEA structured seniors housing as having the potential for higher  volatility through the cycle than other healthcare property types. While Fitch  acknowledges the strength of HCN's RIDEA performance to-date, it has not been  proven through cycles as the investments were largely made in recent years after  the changes in RIDEA regulations allowed for the investments. Operating  fundamentals over the past few years have been largely accommodative but have  been slowing from high single-digit growth rates to 3.2% for 4Q15 over 4Q14.  APPROPRIATE LIQUIDITY & STRONG ACCESS TO CAPITAL Fitch views HCN as having demonstrated strong access to multiple sources of  capital across markets and types including in the United States, United Kingdom  and Canada. HCN's primary source of liquidity is its $2.5 billion unsecured  revolving credit facility due 2018 with a one-year extension option. The  facility bears interest at LIBOR + 92.5bps and had $1.67 billion of availability  at Dec. 31, 2015 before the receipt of $124 million of cash proceeds from a  joint venture transaction and the $700 million note issuance proceeds. Debt  maturities are generally well-staggered through 2018 when 7%-9% matures per  year. Fitch projects HCN's sources of liquidity cover its uses by 1.1x for the period  Jan. 1, 2016 through Dec. 31, 2017 pro forma for the note issuance and announced  acquisitions and joint venture proceeds. Sources of liquidity include  unrestricted cash, availability under the company's unsecured credit facility  pro forma, and projected retained cash flows from operating activities after  dividends. Uses of liquidity include debt maturities, recurring maintenance  capital expenditures, projected development costs and announced investments. HCN's unencumbered assets provided sufficient contingent liquidity to unsecured  bondholders. Assuming a stressed capitalization rate of 8.5%, unencumbered  assets covered unsecured debt by 2.4x as of Dec. 31, 2015  PREFERRED STOCK NOTCHING The two-notch differential between HCN's IDR and preferred stock rating is  consistent with Fitch's criteria for corporate entities with an IDR of 'BBB+'.  Based on Fitch research titled 'Treatment and Notching of Hybrids in  Nonfinancial Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis', these preferred securities are  deeply subordinated and have loss absorption elements that would likely result  in poor recoveries in the event of a corporate default. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions for HCN in our base case include: --2.5% SSNOI growth for 2016 followed by a moderation to 2% growth in 2017; --Capex and G&A grow to maintain historical recurring operating EBITDA margins; --Fitch's projections include the effects of $2 billion of acquisitions annually  in 2016-2017 with yields ranging from 6.5%-7% funded with 40% debt and 60%  equity and proceeds from asset sales. However, HCN's 2016 guidance assumes $1  billion of dispositions without fully offsetting acquisitions which would reduce  leverage further; --Debt repayment with the issuance of new unsecured bonds. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may result in positive momentum in the ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.5x (leverage was 5.7x at  Dec. 31, 2015); --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 4x (fixed charge  coverage was 3.4x for the TTM); --Fitch's expectation of unencumbered asset coverage of unsecured debt at a  stressed 8.5% capitalization rate sustaining above 4x (UA/UD was 2.4x at Dec.  31, 2015).
