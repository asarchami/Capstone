Tele2 said on Thursday it had appointed Allison Kirkby to replace long-serving CFO Lars Nilsson.Kirkby's most recent position was chief financial officer for British television production and distribution firm Shine Group, owned by 21st Century Fox.Tele2's CEO Mats Granryd said there was no connection between Nilsson's departure and the situation in Norway following the loss of the frequency auction there in December. ""Absolutely not,"" Granryd told Reuters.Tele2's head of strategy had left earlier this year while the chief executive of its operations in the Netherlands - where the firm is building a mobile network and plans to launch 4G services - left at the end of last year. In February, Tele2 forecast core earnings of around 6.0 billion crowns ($944 million) for 2014, less than the average 6.3 billion expected in a Reuters poll. It also scrapped its 2015 forecast due to uncertainty about Norway.

12,"  March 26 Media and entertainment company Twenty-First Century Fox Inc  said its board has appointed Lachlan Murdoch non-executive co-chairman and elevated James Murdoch to the position of co-chief operating officer.Lachlan, son of Chief Executive Rupert Murdoch, will work closely with the senior management to develop global strategies and guiding the overall corporate agenda, the company said on Wednesday.""In this elevated role, Lachlan will help us lead News Corp forward as we expand our reach and invest in new technologies and markets around the world,"" Rupert said in a statement. Seven years ago, Lachlan Murdoch turned his back on the business his grandfather founded, quitting his role as deputy chief operating officer after banging heads with his father and the top lieutenants. Since then, he has been focusing on his business interests in Australia through his private investment company Illyria Pty Ltd, which owns various media assets. He also owns about 9 percent of Australia's third-ranked TV network, Ten Network Holdings Ltd. Lachlan, 42, is currently a director at Twenty-First Century Fox Inc and News Corp.

13,"  * Lachlan returns to News fold after some spectacular failures* Murdoch media empire ""like the royal family"" - academic* Lachlan to split time between New York and SydneyBy Jane Wardell and Byron KayeSYDNEY, March 27 Lachlan Murdoch's appointment to senior positions within his father Rupert Murdoch's media empire marks the return of the prodigal son.Nearly a decade after walking away from the News Corp  inner circle in New York to set up his own investment company and settle in Sydney with his young family, it appears Lachlan has accepted the mantle of successor, whether alone or jointly with younger brother James.""It's like the royal family,"" said Alan Knight, professor of journalism at the University of Technology in Sydney. ""Murdoch senior has always treated News Corp as a family business and this guy is just basically accepting his inheritance.""Lachlan, 42, will become non-executive co-chairman of both entertainment company 21st Century Fox and publishing operation News Corp, sharing both roles with his father. He rejoins the company after quitting as deputy chief operating officer in 2005 amid friction with other News Corp executives.However, Lachlan's track record after striking out on his own has been marked by several spectacular failures.His first move, a highly leveraged A$3.3 billion ($3.04 billion) bid with friend and fellow media dynasty heir James Packer for pay-TV company Consolidated Media Holdings fell through as the global financial crisis took hold. Another ill-fated foray with Packer was the creation of telecommunications company One.Tel during the dotcom boom. The pair lost A$1 billion when the company collapsed.As Packer started to exit the media business in favour of building a gaming empire, Lachlan paid A$1.50 per share to purchase a 9 percent stake from his friend in Ten Network Holdings Ltd in 2010.Shares in Ten, Australia's third ranked commercial channel, are now at A$0.27, down 72 percent over the past three years, and it lost almost A$285 million last year. Lachlan is stepping down as non-executive chairman and from the board to avoid conflict with his News Corp roles.""He has never shown any particular innovation in journalism, but he is part of the family, isn't he?"" said Knight.Still, others say that Lachlan had proved himself as chairman of News Ltd before leaving the family firm. ""He wasn't backward in coming forward with his thoughts on what the paper was doing well and what it needed to improve,"" David Penberthy, a former editor of Sydney's Daily Telegraph, told local publication The Monthly last year.PROVE HIMSELF A source who worked with Lachlan in his media investments said it was widely understood that the potential heir wanted to prove himself without his father's backing.Even though the Channel 10 investment failed financially, it allowed Lachlan to stretch his wings as he attempted to direct the upstart station into a more ""grown-up"" competitor for its established rivals, said the source, who requested anonymity as he was not authorised to speak on the record. More successfully, Lachlan bought a 9 percent stake in regional free-to-air television company Prime Media Group Ltd  in 2009, selling it for a A$10 million profit in 2012.Also in 2009, he spent A$110 million buying half of DMG Radio Australia, owner of the Nova radio network, taking full ownership three years later. Under his chairmanship, Nova has become Australia's No.1 radio network.News Corp said Lachlan would divide his time between New York and Sydney, allowing him to continue to develop his separate businesses.Lachlan, while London-born and U.S.-educated, is seen as the most ""Australian"" of Murdoch senior's children. His English-born, Australia-raised model wife Sarah has starred as host of the local version of ""Next Top Model"", while two of his three children were born in Sydney.As recently as last June, he told The Australian Financial Review when asked about the prospect of inheriting his 83-year-old father's empire: ""No. No, I've moved on from that.""Still, the signs were there that the door was not closed.He remained on the board during his years in the wilderness and had been seen as his father's likely successor before he left.Among his siblings, he has arguably the most media experience and was untainted by the British phone hacking scandal that ensnared younger brother James.""For a billionaire media mogul with a supermodel wife, he's actually a really down-to-earth guy,"" said Joe Hildebrand, a columnist at the Daily Telegraph in Sydney.

16,"  (Adds comment from Fox president on conference call)By Abhirup Roy and Liana B. BakerMay 7 Rupert Murdoch-controlled television and film company 21st Century Fox Inc reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by strong Super Bowl advertising and cable network growth.Excluding special items, the company earned 47 cents per share, handily beating the average Wall Street estimate of 35 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose to $8.22 billion from $7.35 billion.Shares in Fox, which separated from News Corp in June, rose 4 percent to $33.50 in extended trading on Wednesday. Chase Carey, Fox's president and chief operating officer, hinted on a conference call with analysts that he was close to renewing his contract with Fox. Carey's contract is up for renewal on June 30 and investors are wondering whether he will stay.At the end of March, Murdoch returned eldest son Lachlan to the leadership of his media empire and promoted younger son James, paving the way for the 83-year-old tycoon's succession plan.

We've simply not gotten it on paper yet."" Advertising revenue in Fox's television business rose 30 percent in the quarter, helped by advertising during Super Bowl XLVIII and the National Football League playoffs.The Super Bowl is rotated yearly across different broadcast networks.""They overdelivered on television which Disney just missed out, so that was a good fact,"" Needham & Co analyst Laura Martin said. Fox reported a 27 percent rise in TV revenue to $1.59 billion, while Disney on Tuesday blamed a decrease in primetime advertising for flat broadcast revenue of $1.50 billion.Revenue at Fox's cable networks, its largest business, grew 11.5 percent to $3.15 billion, driven mainly by a 12 percent rise in domestic affiliate revenue.Fox's stable of cable networks includes the Fox News Channel, Fox Sports, FX Networks, National Geographic channels and a new channel FXX aimed at young adults.Expenses rose 12 percent in the business as the company invests heavily on sports channels, going after Walt Disney Co's  ESPN with its Fox Sports 1 channel launched in August.Net income was $1.05 billion, or 47 cents per share, for the third quarter ended March 31, compared to net income a year ago of $2.89 billion, or $1.22 per share.

23,"   By Eric Kelsey | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Kevin Reilly, the top executive at Fox broadcast television, is leaving the network next month, the company said on Thursday, after Fox slumped to last place in ratings among the big U.S. broadcasters.Reilly's seven years as chairman of entertainment at Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's (FOXA.O) broadcast division ended with marquee programs like ""American Idol"" and ""Glee"" suffering sharp ratings drops.Fox has also lost its top ranking among viewers in the 18-49 age group that advertisers value most.Reilly said in a statement that he and Fox Networks Group chairman and chief executive officer, Peter Rice, had been discussing his departure for a while.""It felt like the timing was as right as it could be,"" Reilly, who joined Fox in 2007 and was named chairman of entertainment in 2012, said in the statement.The move comes after the network presented its fall stable of programming to advertisers earlier this month. Fox said that Reilly's senior executives will report to Rice before the company names a replacement. The network averaged 7.3 million in daily primetime viewers this past season, according to Nielsen data. That was up from 7 million last year, but Fox fell one place to fourth behind, CBS, NBC and ABC, respectively. Its record haul of 111.5 million viewers in February for football's Super Bowl did not deliver a significant improvement on overall viewership.The Super Bowl also failed to boost the coveted 18-49 audience, which remained flat and in second place with 3.1 million viewers on average. Fox's current entertainment slate consists of critically acclaimed shows such as ""The Mindy Project,"" ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine"" and ""New Girl,"" but the shows have so far been unable to become ratings powerhouses for the network.In addition to struggling with falling audiences for  ""American Idol"" and ""Glee,"" the network jettisoned Simon Cowell's singing contest ""The X Factor"" in February after three seasons.Fox also canceled the anticipated science-fiction drama ""Almost Human"" from executive producer and ""Star Trek"" director J.J. Abrams after one season. Fox was the top draw in the 18-49 age group for eight consecutive years before it was knocked to second in the 2012-13 season.NBC, under the ownership of Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) has managed to make a big comeback and now is the top network in the 18-49 age group.  Reilly joined Fox from NBC, where he was the president of entertainment and oversaw the development of shows like hit comedies ""The Office"" and ""30 Rock.""Reilly is also credited with helping usher in the current era of acclaimed and well-rated cable television from his time at Fox's cable network FX where he introduced drama series such as ""Nip/Tuck"" and ""The Shield.""

28,"   By Soyoung Kim and Liana B. Baker | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc made an audacious offer for Time Warner Inc that if it succeeds would transform the American media landscape and cement the 83-year-old's status as the most powerful magnate in U.S. media and entertainment.While Time Warner, whose assets include the HBO cable channel and the Warner Bros movie studio, rejected the $80 billion bid, Murdoch is unlikely to abandon the pursuit and has the “disciplined determination” to get the deal done, people close to the situation said. Investors expect he will eventually raise the offer and increase the cash component – 40 percent - to win the prize.Murdoch's proposal, fresh on the heels of his high-profile divorce and a damaging phone-hacking scandal that involved his British tabloids, is aggressively bold even for a media mogul whose ambitions are legendary. A combined Fox-Time Warner would have a massive array of media and sports content and be in a very powerful negotiating position with cable and satellite distributors - some of whom have themselves announced mega-deals and newer ways of getting to consumers, such as online video distributors Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc.""It's a chance to put some great programming and content assets under one umbrella,"" a person close to the situation said. ""There are other alternatives, but none of them fit anywhere near as well as this does."" Still, Time Warner pushed back strongly against Murdoch's approach, insisting the offer undervalued the media conglomerate and raising fears about the dominating role that his family would play, another person close to the situation said on Wednesday.    In particular, the board is worried about the future value of Fox's shares, which represented 60 percent of its cash-and-stock proposal. Those fears were magnified by a lack of voting rights, the source said, as that would concentrate too much power in the hands of Murdoch and his sons.""To do a merger of this scale and size where Time Warner shareholders have no insight into the destiny of the company is very troubling,"" the source, who was not authorized to speak on the record, told Reuters. Time Warner Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Bewkes told the conglomerate's employees in a videotaped appearance that the company's standalone strategic plan would create value ""superior to any proposal"" that Fox could offer.The acquisition, if ever completed, would mark the second-largest media deal ever, when debt is included, trailing only Time Warner's disastrous takeover of AOL in 2000. In the end, a Time Warner deal is likely to hinge on price. The source pointed out that Fox's stock has traded at the highest multiple of its peer group and Time Warner - prior to its 17 percent rally on Wednesday - was trading at the lowest. Time Warner worries that the stock - the main ""currency"" of the deal - may be ripe for a pullback, lowering the value that is currently on the table.According to StarMine SmartEstimates, Fox shares trade at a multiple of about 19.5 times 12-month forward earnings, above the group median of 17.8 and now in line with Time Warner's 19.5 times - a valuation substantially above where the shares closed on Tuesday.Shares of Fox dropped 6.2 percent to $33. The offer, first reported by The New York Times, was worth  about $80 billion, or $85 a share, when it was made in June.Fox estimates that a combined company, which would have $60 billion in annual revenue, would save $1 billion in costs and possibly more, the people familiar with the matter said.    Detailed negotiations with Time Warner could reveal even more potential savings, they said, which may then justify sweetening the offer.Fox said no talks were under way, and it has no desire to go hostile or to bid against itself with a higher offer, the people familiar with the matter said.Either way, a takeover by Fox could win the blessing of many of Time Warner's shareholders, a majority of whom also own Fox's non-voting stock. In addition, Time Warner does not have a staggered board and its bylaws allow as few as 15 percent of shareholders to call a special meeting, factors that could help a takeover bid.A number of Time Warner shareholders said Twenty-First Century Fox and Murdoch might have to raise the bid to as high as $95 per share from $85 when the bid was made in June to wrap up a merger. Murdoch also would do well to offer more cash upfront, investors said. Time Warner has no controlling shareholder, meaning the company could easily go into play, said Ken Griffin, founder and chief executive of Citadel LLC, which owns shares in both companies. “It’s going to be tough to say no,” he said during a conference in New York.Mario Gabelli, chairman and CEO of Gamco Investors, said he expects a technology company with more cash than Fox, such as Apple or Amazon, could emerge with a bid. “It’s not a dynamic I want to dismiss out of hand.

29,"  (Recasts, adding quote from Bewkes)By Soyoung Kim and Liana B. BakerNEW YORK, July 16 Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox Inc made an audacious offer for Time Warner Inc that if it succeeds would transform the American media landscape and cement the 83-year-old's status as the most powerful magnate in U.S. media and entertainment.While Time Warner, whose assets include the HBO cable channel and the Warner Bros movie studio, rejected the $80 billion bid, Murdoch is unlikely to abandon the pursuit and has the ""disciplined determination"" to get the deal done, people close to the situation said. Investors expect he will eventually raise the offer and increase the cash component - 40 percent - to win the prize.Murdoch's proposal, fresh on the heels of his high-profile divorce and a damaging phone-hacking scandal that involved his British tabloids, is aggressively bold even for a media mogul whose ambitions are legendary.A combined Fox-Time Warner would have a massive array of media and sports content and be in a very powerful negotiating position with cable and satellite distributors - some of whom have themselves announced mega-deals and newer ways of getting to consumers, such as online video distributors Netflix Inc  and Amazon.com Inc.""It's a chance to put some great programming and content assets under one umbrella,"" a person close to the situation said. ""There are other alternatives, but none of them fit anywhere near as well as this does.""Still, Time Warner pushed back strongly against Murdoch's approach, insisting the offer undervalued the media conglomerate and raising fears about the dominating role that his family would play, another person close to the situation said on Wednesday.In particular, the board is worried about the future value of Fox's shares, which represented 60 percent of its cash-and-stock proposal. Those fears were magnified by a lack of voting rights, the source said, as that would concentrate too much power in the hands of Murdoch and his sons.""To do a merger of this scale and size where Time Warner shareholders have no insight into the destiny of the company is very troubling,"" the source, who was not authorized to speak on the record, told Reuters.Time Warner Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Bewkes told the conglomerate's employees in a videotaped appearance that the company's standalone strategic plan would create value ""superior to any proposal"" that Fox could offer.The acquisition, if ever completed, would mark the second-largest media deal ever, when debt is included, trailing only Time Warner's disastrous takeover of AOL in 2000.In the end, a Time Warner deal is likely to hinge on price. The source pointed out that Fox's stock has traded at the highest multiple of its peer group and Time Warner - prior to its 17 percent rally on Wednesday - was trading at the lowest. Time Warner worries that the stock - the main ""currency"" of the deal - may be ripe for a pullback, lowering the value that is currently on the table.According to StarMine SmartEstimates, Fox shares trade at a multiple of about 19.5 times 12-month forward earnings, above the group median of 17.8 and now in line with Time Warner's 19.5 times - a valuation substantially above where the shares closed on Tuesday.

37,"  * Bid worth about $80 billion -sources* Murdoch may consider higher offer for Time Warner -sources* Time Warner shares up 17.3 percent   (Changes throughout with sourcing, company background)By Soyoung Kim and Liana B. BakerNEW YORK, July 16 Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox Inc said on Wednesday it had offered to buy Time Warner Inc, a move that would unite two of the world's most powerful media conglomerates, but Time Warner rebuffed its offer.Time Warner's stock jumped 17.3 percent to $83.33 on the New York Stock Exchange after news that Murdoch had his sights on Time Warner, the owner of the Warner Bros. movie studio and cable channels such as HBO and CNN, among other media properties.Murdoch's cash-and-stock bid was worth about $80 billion, or $85 per share, people familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier on Wednesday. The offer, first reported by The New York Times, consisted of 60 percent in stock and the rest in cash. Twenty-First Century Fox later confirmed it had made a formal takeover proposal in June but said there were no talks currently under way.Even so, Murdoch and his advisers are unlikely to abandon his ambition to put Time Warner in his empire so easily, one of the people said, pointing out that he has the ""disciplined determination"" to get a deal done.Fox's overtures to Time Warner could accelerate a wave of consolidation that is already reshaping the U.S. media landscape. Reuters reported this month that Murdoch was in the midst of a deal that would give Fox the firepower to buy a content company.Fox, which owns cable news channel Fox News as well as movie studio 20th Century Fox, has indicated it would sell CNN as part of its proposal to buy Time Warner to clear any regulatory hurdles, according to the people familiar with the matter.""(It) would be good deal for Fox if it goes through Washington (regulators) with CNN sales,"" Wunderlich Securities analyst Matthew Harrigan told Reuters in an email. He said the ""fair public value"" for Time Warner was $82 a share. Fox currently estimates that a combined company would save $1 billion in costs and possibly more, primarily by cutting sales staff and back-office functions, the people familiar with the matter said.It believes that detailed negotiations with Time Warner could reveal much higher synergies than $1 billion, which may justify Fox sweetening its offer, the people said.The combined company's revenue would be more than $60 billion.Twenty-First Century Fox is in the middle of a reorganization of its television business as the network seeks to lift itself out of last place among the big U.S. broadcasters.The shakeup of Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox's TV units comes a year after the film and TV company was spun off from Murdoch's News Corp, which now operates publishing assets, including the Wall Street Journal.Twenty-First Century Fox is being advised by Goldman Sachs  and Centerview Partners, while Time Warner is working with Citigroup.

38,"   By Soyoung Kim and Liana B. Baker | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc made an audacious offer for Time Warner Inc that if it succeeds would transform the American media landscape and cement the 83-year-old's status as the most powerful magnate in U.S. media and entertainment.While Time Warner, whose assets include the HBO cable channel and the Warner Bros movie studio, rejected the $80 billion bid, Murdoch is unlikely to abandon the pursuit and has the “disciplined determination” to get the deal done, people close to the situation said. Investors expect he will eventually raise the offer and increase the cash component – 40 percent - to win the prize.Murdoch's proposal, fresh on the heels of his high-profile divorce and a damaging phone-hacking scandal that involved his British tabloids, is aggressively bold even for a media mogul whose ambitions are legendary. A combined Fox-Time Warner would have a massive array of media and sports content and be in a very powerful negotiating position with cable and satellite distributors - some of whom have themselves announced mega-deals and newer ways of getting to consumers, such as online video distributors Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc.""It's a chance to put some great programming and content assets under one umbrella,"" a person close to the situation said. ""There are other alternatives, but none of them fit anywhere near as well as this does."" Still, Time Warner pushed back strongly against Murdoch's approach, insisting the offer undervalued the media conglomerate and raising fears about the dominating role that his family would play, another person close to the situation said on Wednesday.    In particular, the board is worried about the future value of Fox's shares, which represented 60 percent of its cash-and-stock proposal. Those fears were magnified by a lack of voting rights, the source said, as that would concentrate too much power in the hands of Murdoch and his sons.""To do a merger of this scale and size where Time Warner shareholders have no insight into the destiny of the company is very troubling,"" the source, who was not authorized to speak on the record, told Reuters. Time Warner Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Bewkes told the conglomerate's employees in a videotaped appearance that the company's standalone strategic plan would create value ""superior to any proposal"" that Fox could offer.The acquisition, if ever completed, would mark the second-largest media deal ever, when debt is included, trailing only the disasterous takeover of Time Warner by AOL in 2000. In the end, a Time Warner deal is likely to hinge on price. The source pointed out that Fox's stock has traded at the highest multiple of its peer group and Time Warner - prior to its 17 percent rally on Wednesday - was trading at the lowest. Time Warner worries that the stock - the main ""currency"" of the deal - may be ripe for a pullback, lowering the value that is currently on the table.According to StarMine SmartEstimates, Fox shares trade at a multiple of about 19.5 times 12-month forward earnings, above the group median of 17.8 and now in line with Time Warner's 19.5 times - a valuation substantially above where the shares closed on Tuesday.Shares of Fox dropped 6.2 percent to $33. The offer, first reported by The New York Times, was worth  about $80 billion, or $85 a share, when it was made in June.Fox estimates that a combined company, which would have $60 billion in annual revenue, would save $1 billion in costs and possibly more, the people familiar with the matter said.    Detailed negotiations with Time Warner could reveal even more potential savings, they said, which may then justify sweetening the offer.Fox said no talks were under way, and it has no desire to go hostile or to bid against itself with a higher offer, the people familiar with the matter said.Either way, a takeover by Fox could win the blessing of many of Time Warner's shareholders, a majority of whom also own Fox's non-voting stock. In addition, Time Warner does not have a staggered board and its bylaws allow as few as 15 percent of shareholders to call a special meeting, factors that could help a takeover bid.A number of Time Warner shareholders said Twenty-First Century Fox and Murdoch might have to raise the bid to as high as $95 per share from $85 when the bid was made in June to wrap up a merger. Murdoch also would do well to offer more cash upfront, investors said.Time Warner has no controlling shareholder, meaning the company could easily go into play, said Ken Griffin, founder and chief executive of Citadel LLC, which owns shares in both companies. “It’s going to be tough to say no,” he said during a conference in New York. Mario Gabelli, chairman and CEO of Gamco Investors, said he expects a technology company with more cash than Fox, such as Apple or Amazon, could emerge with a bid. “It’s not a dynamic I want to dismiss out of hand. They have a currency, and they understand the value of content,” he said of the tech companies."" Gamco's funds own about 3.6 million shares of Time Warner and about 10.5 million Fox shares.   SEEKING DANCE PARTNERS     Fox's overtures are likely to reverberate across the industry, accelerating a wave of consolidation that is already well underway. Comcast Corp, the largest U.S. cable provider, offered in February to buy Time Warner Cable Inc for $45.2 billion in stock. Overseas, Fox's 39 percent-owned British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc is negotiating to buy Fox's Sky Italia and its Sky Deutschland subsidiary in a deal that could net Fox as much as $13 billion. As a consequence of the Murdoch bid, ""the urgency to find a dance partner will increase across the sector,"" said Bernstein Research analyst Todd Juenger. U.S. media shares closed higher on the deal, with top gainers including Discovery Communications Inc, up 6.3 percent; Viacom Inc, which rose 3.3 percent; and AMC Networks Inc, ending 4.5 percent higher.Murdoch started thinking about a potential merger with Time Warner as he was separating Twenty-First Century Fox, which mostly consists of media properties, from News Corp, focused on the Wall Street Journal and other publishing assets, people familiar with the company said. The separation, triggered by the British phone-hacking scandal which dragged Murdoch before the British parliament, has in the end positioned Fox to become a powerful consolidator of media properties, people familiar with the matter said. Fox has indicated it would sell Time Warner's CNN cable channel, a direct competitor of Fox News, to clear any regulatory hurdles, according to the people.At least one antitrust expert, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said it was unlikely that any issues that arise would kill a Fox deal for Time Warner. The source pointed out that there were five major content companies in the United States, plus numerous smaller ones.News of the Time Warner bid comes as Fox is reorganizing its television business, aiming to lift its network out of last place among the big U.S. broadcasters.Fox is being advised by Goldman Sachs and Centerview Partners, while Time Warner is working with Citigroup, people familiar with the matter said.

40,"   By Ronald Grover  and Diane Bartz  Twenty-First Century Fox's plan to buy Time Warner could create an upheaval in the sports television world, creating the first meaningful challenge to Walt Disney Co's ESPN.Time Warner's board has rejected an $80 billion bid, but Fox Chairman Rupert Murdoch is unlikely to walk away quickly. A deal would bring him college basketball's ""March Madness"" championship tournament, prime time National Basketball Association (NBA) games, and Major League Baseball (MLB) games.Fox's sports rights include National Football League games, professional baseball games and NASCAR racing. In 2015 it gets the rights to women's World Cup soccer and in 2018 the men's World Cup.Disney's ESPN, with Monday Night Football, Major League Baseball games, NBA games and college football, will still be the team to beat, but for once there might be a match. ""You start to put it all together and you create a significant competitor to ESPN for ratings and advertising dollars,” said Marc Ganis, a sports TV consultant. In an age of DVRs and on demand viewing, sports stands out for its ability to draw television audiences which are large and watch live, two traits crucial for selling advertising, says Ed Desser, a former president of NBA Television and New Media Ventures, who advises teams and league's on their TV contracts.""It's TV's growth engine,"" he says. ""It drives subscriber fees and keeps people watching.""Ganis speculates that some key Time Warner sports, such as its professional basketball doubleheaders, could move from TNT to Fox Sports 1. Fox Sports 1 already airs major league baseball, motor sports, mixed marital arts and college football and basketball games from the larger conferences. The additions could allow Fox Sports 1, now in about 90 million homes, to add subscribers and raise the affiliate fees from cable and satellite operators that make up the majority of its revenues.ESPN is in more than 100 million homes, not too far ahead of Fox.However, ESPN currently can charge cable companies $6.04 per month for each subscriber, according to data compiled by consultant SNL Kagan. By comparison, Fox Sports 1 is paid 68 cents for each of its subscribers. Thanks in part to its National Basketball Association games, TNT gets $1.48 per subscriber.  SPREADING THE COSTS Murdoch could also use Time Warner's collection of channels to outbid competitors for key sporting events, spreading the costs among its Fox network and cable channels, said Derek Baine, Research Director at SNL Kagan.""One of the things driving this deal is that Fox will be more aggressively bidding on sports rights, so this will give them more fire power,"" Baine said in an email. ""Like NBCU with the Olympics, they can spread games across multiple networks."" Combining the two would also eliminate a major buyer of sports programming, which may raise concerns at the U.S. Justice Department when it reviews a deal, said Peter Carstensen, who teaches antitrust at the University of Wisconsin Law School.Carstensen says the review may focus on specific parts of the content business -- movies, sports, news -- rather than a new company's entire offering of content.""My guess is that enforcers are less likely to be concerned by the overall programming,"" he said. ""If you're not going to take the general market view, you may have to divest some sports programming.""Fox also will have to convince sports leagues or conferences to alter existing contracts to shift around the sports, said Desser. Contracts usually tightly prescribe where games can be shown, and leagues are loath to change them for fear of upsetting other TV rights holders.Fox already airs NBA games on many of its 22 regional sports cable channels, he says.""But anything is possible, and deals get rewritten,"" he said. ""Sports are such a pure growth engine that they may try.""

41,"   By Ross Kerber | BOSTON  BOSTON To clinch a deal to buy Time Warner Inc, Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox Inc will not only need to raise the value of its bid above $80 billion but also boost its ratio of cash to stock, investors said on Wednesday.Time Warner said it rejected Murdoch’s unsolicited offer, of which 60 percent would be Twenty-First Century Fox stock and 40 percent cash, a far-reaching proposal that would reshape the media landscape.A number of Time Warner shareholders said Fox and Murdoch, its Chairman and Chief Executive, may have to raise the bid to as much as $95 a share and boost its cash component to wrap up a merger. Murdoch offered about $85 a share when the bid was made in June.""Rupert has got to figure out a way to get more cash in the deal,"" said Mario Gabelli, Chairman and CEO of Gamco Investors. Gamco's funds own about 3.6 million shares of Time Warner. Like many other shareholders, Gamco also owns stock in Murdoch's company -- about 10.5 million shares -- and Gabelli said some of his own investors are not eager to increase the number of those shares as part of a merger.Another executive at one of Time Warner's large institutional shareholders also said he would look for Murdoch to offer a higher ratio of cash to firm up the value of the deal. Prospects for gains in Fox stock in the near term could be constrained by the difficulties of merging the two businesses, including wringing out cost savings, and the effect of the likely debt burden Fox assume after borrowing billions of dollars.""Cash is cash, so you know exactly what the value is,"" this person said.Even though this executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of company policy, said he thought the overall value of the proposed deal was fair, Murdoch can still raise his bid.

Including the assumption of Time Warner debt, the deal would have been worth $94.3 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Twenty-First Century Fox shares fell 6 percent to $33.     Time Warner said the strength of its own strategy and ""significant risk and uncertainty as to the valuation"" of Fox's stock were reasons for rejecting the bid. It also noted the stock did not have voting rights, a type of share that typically trades at a discount.A Time Warner spokesman declined further comment. A spokesman for Twenty-First Century Fox declined to comment.Mitch Zacks, portfolio manager and principal of Zacks Investment Management of Chicago, said Time Warner's board may have rejected the offer as a bargaining tactic.""My guess is that if the offer goes to about $95 per share, the board would have a hard time turning it down,"" he said. Zacks declined to discuss exactly what price he would accept to sell his own shares. He said his firm has about 192,000 Time Warner shares and none of 21st Century Fox.Zacks also noted low interest rates make it easy for companies to finance borrowing but that stock prices are at all-time highs, creating currency for deals and helping drive an M&A boom. A high stock price could be tempting Murdoch's company to prefer stock than cash as its currency.Shawn Narancich, executive vice president at Ferguson Wellman Capital Management in Portland, Oregon, said with Wednesday's price run-up, Time Warner now trades in line with some competitors, about 20 times estimated 2014 earnings. Time Warner's growth projections could justify its rejection of the original offer, Narancich said. As a shareholder he said he would likely sell Time Warner shares if Fox or another buyer offered $90 to $95 a share.""At those levels, it becomes harder for Time Warner to argue the merits of continuing to remain independent,"" Narancich said.

Mitch Zacks, portfolio manager and principal of Zacks Investment Management of Chicago, said Time Warner's board may have rejected the offer as a bargaining tactic.""My guess is that if the offer goes to about $95 per share, the board would have a hard time turning it down,"" he said.Zacks declined to discuss exactly what price he would accept to sell his own shares. He said his firm has about 192,000 Time Warner shares and none of 21st Century Fox.Zacks also noted low interest rates make it easy for companies to finance borrowing but that stock prices are at all-time highs, creating currency for deals and helping drive an M&A boom. A high stock price could be tempting Murdoch's company to prefer stock than cash as its currency.Shawn Narancich, executive vice president at Ferguson Wellman Capital Management in Portland, Oregon, said with Wednesday's price run-up, Time Warner now trades in line with some competitors, about 20 times estimated 2014 earnings.Time Warner's growth projections could justify its rejection of the original offer, Narancich said. As a shareholder he said he would likely sell Time Warner shares if Fox or another buyer offered $90 to $95 a share.""At those levels, it becomes harder for Time Warner to argue the merits of continuing to remain independent,"" Narancich said.

43,"   By Soyoung Kim and David Gaffen | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Many investors say the best trading strategy around a potential takeover of Time Warner Inc by Twenty-First Century Fox is to wager that media baron Rupert Murdoch will pay up to get what he wants. The trick is that it may be too late to place the obvious bets.Time Warner said on Wednesday it had rebuffed Twenty-First Century Fox's roughly $80 billion bid, or $85 per share, in recent weeks over valuation and concerns that the Murdoch family will have too much power. But people familiar with Twenty-First Century Fox said Murdoch is determined to buy the rival media giant.Hedge fund traders and options strategists said the traditional merger arbitrage trade - short Twenty-First Century Fox and buy Time Warner - played out when the news broke.Arbitrageurs seek to profit on the difference in stock prices between an acquirer and the target. In a deal that involves the swap of stock, that generally involves buying the target's shares and betting the acquirer's will fall. Murdoch made a stock and cash offer for Time Warner.But these traders said that the time for that bet may have passed. Time Warner's stock has risen 21 percent to $86.12, since the news broke. Twenty-First Century Fox has fallen nearly 7 percent.""Fox shares will spike higher if this deal is killed or if Time Warner bids for something,"" making a defensive acquisition, one arbitrageur said. ""Time Warner will also remain range-bound, unless there is a higher bid or it does something that destroys the process, or something to buy another company.""So investors who missed that window must now make bolder bets if they still want in on the trade.  Sources have said that Twenty-First Century Fox could see more than $1 billion in synergies from a deal.One hedge fund manager said in his reckoning synergies from the deal could be as high as $1.5 billion, which would allow Twenty-First Century Fox to pay as much as $95 per share to $100 per share and still have a deal be substantially accretive to 2016 earnings. The hedge fund manager said many arbitrageurs are remaining long in shares of Time Warner, given Murdoch's reputation as a tenacious dealmaker. Murdoch, for example, overcame stiff resistance from some members of the Bancroft family to buy Dow Jones in 2007. But he did not raise his bid at the time. ""The key right now for me is, 'What is my downside?'"" said one hedge fund trader. ""The price on the table is not the right price. It's not going to get it done."" The trader said he owns a relatively small position in Time Warner and is evaluating how -- and whether -- to place a bigger bet.AN OPTION  One way to put less money on the line while betting that Twenty-First Century Fox will raise its bid is to buy Time Warner stock options. Activity in the options market already shows investors are optimistic that either a bidding war could occur or Murdoch could end up raising his initial offer.  There was substantial activity in Time Warner call options expiring in mid-August with a $90 strike price - bullish bets that the stock will hit that level by that expiration. ""For you to buy an August $90, you have to believe there's a higher bid in the next month here or an increased bid by him,"" said William Lefkowitz, chief options strategist at vFinance Investments.There were also notable new positions taken in call options expiring in mid-October at the $95 and $100 strike prices, which also suggests a belief that shares will keep rising. Nearly 2,000 new contracts were purchased at the $100 strike price for October, according to Thomson Reuters data.But the bid-ask spread in August options contracts is at a very wide range – between 40 and 60 cents for a number of contracts. That makes it more expensive to make such a bet. The better bet may be in the stock market, which has tighter spreads. Arbitrageurs will usually play in the market with tighter spreads because of efficiency, said J.J. Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade.  WHITHER HEDGES? There are few other options at the moment to arbitrage this deal, traders said.In a sign that investors think Fox shares have fallen as much as they will, short interest is muted.As of Wednesday, short interest in Twenty-First Century Fox was around 2.8 percent of the outstanding shares, a relatively low amount, according to data firm Markit. The credit default swaps market, another avenue to hedge or bet on the trade, may not work out either, one arbitrageur said. ""These names are great credits, so even if Fox levers up to do a deal, it won't widen much. I doubt there's much to be done in CDS on this one,"" the arbitrageur said. Twenty-First Century Fox's 5-year CDS price jumped about 20 percent Wednesday to their highest since February, but they moved no further on Thursday and remain relatively low. Time Warner's dropped nearly 6 percent.

47,"  Time Warner Inc's board moved to prevent its shareholders from calling special meetings, effectively throwing up a hurdle to any quick move to approve a potential takeover by Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox.  Fox made an offer for Time Warner for about $80 billion or about $85 per share in a mix of stock and cash that Time Warner rebuffed, both companies disclosed last week. Time Warner previously allowed as few as 15 percent of its shareholders to call a special meeting, factors that could help a takeover bid. The move, revealed in a regulatory filing on Monday, was not preempted by any particular investor buying large amounts of Time Warner shares but rather to give the board the ability to defend itself from an unsolicited bid, two sources close to the matter said.The sources said the board believed the move was in the best interests of all its shareholders. ""When you are facing a hostile bid, you don't want to give the bidder the ability to artificially preempt that process,"" one of the sources said. The amended bylaw is temporary, however, as the board said it plans to reinstate the special meeting provision during its 2015 annual meeting, according to the filing.     Similar moves have been taken by other takeover targets in recent years, including Airgas Inc, which eventually implemented a poison pill that blocked a $5.9 billion hostile bid from Air Products and Chemicals Inc. The sources, who declined to identified because the discussions are private, would not speculate whether Time Warner's board would also put a poison pill in place.    A spokesman for Time Warner, which owns cable networks TNT and CNN, pay-TV channel HBO and Warner Bros movie studio, declined to comment.Time Warner Chief Executive Jeffrey Bewkes told his employees in video that the company's standalone strategic plan would create value ""superior to any proposal"" that Fox could offer. Part of the issue involves the mix of cash and stock and lack of control of Time Warner's shareholders if a deal should go through, sources told Reuters last week. Murdoch controls Fox through a 39 percent stake in special shares that were not part of the offer. Fox offered 60 percent in common stock and 40 percent cash.Several Time Warner shareholders told Reuters last week that Fox may have to raise the bid to as much as $95 a share boosting its cash component to seal a merger.

Additionally, CDS liquidity for FOX has increased notably over the past few  weeks, and is currently trading in the 15th regional percentile, up nine  rankings since July 8. Increased CDS liquidity reflects higher levels of market  uncertainty over the future direction of spreads for the media giant.  Time Warner has reportedly turned down an $80 billion acquisition offer from  FOX. The offer was at about a 25% premium of the stock price a day prior. If  formed, the combined company would be valued at roughly $150 billion and would  form one of the largest media firms globally.  We believe the deal makes strategic sense for both companies. FOX would benefit  from the acquisition by adding more leverage in deal-making with cable  companies, expand its rights to broadcast sporting events, while Time Warner  would add to its already impressive Hollywood studio. Rating concerns for Time Warner, apart from M&A activity, center on the  company's ability to balance escalating programming expenses and production  costs with the requirement to consistently deliver programming that drives  incremental viewer share while maintaining or expanding operating margins. Time  Warner's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is 'BBB+' and the Rating Outlook is Stable.  For FOX, exposure to cyclical advertising revenues within the company's local  television and Fox Network ad sales highlights rating concerns, as does the  company's capacity to adapt to ever-changing media consumption patterns and  technology platforms. FOX's IDR is currently 'BBB+' with a Stable Outlook.

53,"   By Ronald Grover , Jennifer Saba and Liana B. Baker | LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK  LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK Chase Carey, Twenty-First Century Fox's president and chief operating officer, may be feeling pressure to stay in his job for several more years both from his boss, Rupert Murdoch, and from the company Murdoch is trying to buy, Time Warner Inc.As Murdoch mulls his next step following Time Warner’s rejection of his $80 billion offer, some Time Warner investors say they are concerned about who might succeed the 83-year-old chairman and chief executive. In particular, they're not sure whether Murdoch's sons, James, 41, and Lachlan, 42, are ready to manage the integration challenge. That's where Carey comes in.The 60-year-old New Yorker, who's been working for Murdoch since 1988 and earned a reputation for a no-nonsense leadership style, signed a two-year contract with Fox in June that gives him the option to opt out after 18 months. That's raised concern that two years won't be long enough given the complexity of the deal and the likelihood that it may not close until the end of 2015, if not later.""There is a big push for Carey to stick around to handle the transition if not beyond,"" said one person familiar with Fox's thinking. ""There's no way that after working for 30 years for Rupert and he gets his crowning deal that Carey would bail on him.""The succession issue is important to Time Warner shareholders not only because of concerns about the experience of Murdoch’s sons but also because the way the bid was structured, Time Warner shareholders would have no voting shares: Murdoch controls Fox through a special class of voting stock that is not part of the deal. The deal would be less risky for Time Warner shareholders if Carey were still in the job, said one person familiar with Time Warner.Fox spokesman Nathaniel Brown declined to comment. Time Warner spokesman Keith Cocozza also declined to comment. Carey didn't respond to a request for comment.""The reasons people like Carey is he is decisive, he doesn't use words to create obfuscation, he is very direct and extraordinarily candid for a senior executive,"" said Larry Haverty, a portfolio manager at Gabelli with stakes in Fox and Time Warner.""If I had to pick between James and Chase I would pick Chase,"" Haverty said, if the merger happens. On July 16 Time Warner said it rebuffed an $80 billion bid from Fox, including about $85 per share in cash and non-voting stock.The Murdoch family, including James, is so behind Carey that during the contract negotiations Carey was asked to stay three years, according to two people familiar with the talks. One of those sources said that Carey and James have become close and that James is among his strongest supporters. MEDIA COLOSSUS In March, Murdoch elevated James to co-chief operating officer with Carey. Lachlan returned to the fold after nearly ten years to become non-executive co-chairman of both Fox and News Corp, the publishing assets that were cleaved off from the entertainment division in a corporate split last year.Investors in both companies view Carey as well equipped to handle the job of combining and managing an entertainment and news colossus that would alter the media landscape. A merger would bring under single management the major movie studios Warner Bros and Twentieth Century Fox, a vast array of broadcast and cable networks that includes Turner Broadcasting System and Fox News, and HBO, one of the most successful pay-TV channels.  ""You are dealing with the necessity to manage globally an enormously (big) empire. I think Chase has done that with a company half the size where James has proved he has led a single business,"" Haverty said, noting that James did an ""outstanding job"" as CEO of British pay-TV provider BSkyB, which is 39-percent owned by Fox.

55,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 25 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings believes Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.'s  (FOXA) decision to transfer its European direct broadcast satellite businesses  to British Sky Broadcasting Group plc (BSkyB) in a transaction valued at  approximately $9.3 billion improves the company's liquidity position and overall  financial flexibility.  Consideration for the exchange consists of $8.6 billion  of cash and BSkyB's 21% interest in National Geographic Channels International  and will generate approximately $7.2 billion of net cash proceeds. The  transaction is in line with the company's objective to streamline its  organizational structure. FOXA also announced a renewed share repurchase authorization that will be  executed during the company's fiscal year 2015. Shareholder returns that exceed  FCF generation are incorporated into FOXA's current ratings provided that  leverage remains below Fitch's 3.0x leverage threshold for FOXA's current 'BBB+'  rating. From Fitch's perspective FOXA has the necessary financial flexibility, primarily  through monetization of non-core assets, including the transaction announced  today, along with expected free cash flow (FCF) generation, to maintain strong  'BBB' ratings should the company elect to continue pursuing an acquisition of  Time Warner, Inc. (TWX). Time Warner previously rejected FOXA's unsolicited bid  of $85 per share consisting of 1.531 FOXA non-voting common stock and $32.42 in  cash per Time Warner share.   Should a transaction between FOXA and Time Warner materialize, Fitch will have a  level of tolerance within the existing rating level should the combined company  initially operate outside the parameters of the 'BBB+' rating, provided a  creditable de-leveraging plan is in place that reduces leverage to a level more  reflective of the rating within Fitch's rating horizon (typically 12 to 18  months for M&A related activity). Fitch believes the de-leveraging plan would  likely include asset sales including FOXA's DBS business in Italy and Germany in  addition to asset divestures required to gain regulatory approval.  In Fitch's opinion, a potential acquisition of TWX does not address any apparent  material strategic deficit within FOXA's asset and business portfolio. Fitch  holds FOXA's overall strategic positioning in high regard as its businesses  consist of a strong collection of cable networks, leading television and film  studios, national television network with robust sports-programming rights,  local television broadcast assets and international direct broadcast satellite  business. Each of FOXA's businesses have the scale characteristics to operate at  high margins and generate meaningful levels of free cash flow (FCF) and  positions the company to address the secular threats and opportunities presented  by changing media consumption patterns and continued audience fragmentation  across the media and entertainment landscape.  Nonetheless, Fitch recognizes the potential scale benefits related to a Time  Warner acquisition, which in turn can facilitate further investment in  programming and production leading to stronger content creation and brand  development. At the same time, Fitch also recognizes the potential execution,  operational and regulatory risks associated with the transaction. Demand for  high-quality content remains strong across all major end-markets (broadcast,  cable networks and subscription video on demand). Fitch continues to believe  that the entities which control the creation and production of high-quality,  'must have' video content will be better positioned to address secular issues  including evolving media consumption patterns, the emergence of alternative  distribution platforms, growing preference for time-shifted viewing, and growing  competition from online video sources, all of which lead to continuing audience  fragmentation. The potential transaction with Time Warner comes amid  transforming consolidation within the telecommunications and pay-TV sector  including Comcast Corporation's pending acquisition of Time Warner Cable, Inc.  and AT&T, Inc.'s proposed purchase of DIRECTV creating further risk to the  operating profile.  The centerpiece of any potential transaction with Time Warner would be the  creation of a powerful film and television studio, including premium pay  television programmer HBO, with the ability to create, produce and distribute  high-quality content with a broad audience appeal across multiple distribution  platforms on a global basis. The addition of Time Warner's cable network  business (including an enviable sports rights portfolio associated with those  networks) and the strong competitive position of Time Warner's film and  television studios at Warner Bros. enhances FOX's existing asset portfolio and  could enable FOX to maintain healthy pricing models for their businesses and  protect their ability to attract viewing audiences.  From a credit perspective, Fitch's base case assumes a purchase price of $100  per share with consideration consisting of $50 per share in cash and the  remainder in FOXA non-voting common stock. Fitch notes that its base case should  not be construed as a valuation of Time Warner common stock, or a threshold or  limitation for any rating category, but put forth for illustrative purpose.  Fitch further assumes that there will not be any debt structure issues and  bondholders will benefit from both FOX and Time Warner's businesses and cash  flows. Fitch estimates FOX will issue approximately $40 billion of debt to  facilitate the transaction (in the absence of proceeds from anticipated asset  sales) leading to pro forma leverage of 5.6x as of the LTM period ended March  31, 2014. Pro forma leverage includes $1 billion of anticipated expense  synergies. Pro forma leverage declines to 4.9x assuming $10 billion of net asset  sale proceeds. Fitch case further assumes FOX adopts a conservative capital  structure policy by largely eliminating share repurchases, reducing dividends  and direct free cash flow generation to debt reduction. Fitch's base case  estimates that the combined entity's FCF generation approximates 9% of revenues  initially and grows to nearly 11% of revenues within Fitch's rating horizon.  Additionally leverage trends below 3.5 within the same timeframe and drops to 3x  within three years of the transaction closing likely positioning FOX's credit  profile strongly within the 'BBB' category.  Conversely should the combined entity adopt a more aggressive capital allocation  policy or if FOXA's accepted transaction terms are more aggressive than Fitch's  base case, Fitch maintains that it would be difficult for the combined entity to  maintain the current ratings. However under such a scenario Fitch would expect  that negative rating action would be limited to two notches.

59,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) LONDON, July 29 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has placed British Sky Broadcasting plc's  (Sky) Long term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured rating of  'BBB+' on Rating Watch Negative (RWN) following the announcement of Sky's  proposed acquisition of 100% of Sky Italia and a 57.4% stake in Sky Deutschland  from Twenty-First Century Fox.  The most likely outcome of the RWN will be a two-notch downgrade to 'BBB-', with  its resolution subject to closing of the deal, which remains subject to  regulatory clearance and shareholder approvals. Management's commitment to an  investment grade rating and track record of delivering targeted metrics is an  important factor. The potential exists for financial metrics that might appear  challenging at the investment grade level, given the required offer to Sky  Deutschland minorities. However, this is not our base case, while Fitch believes  mitigating action would be available and be taken by management in this event.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Announced Transaction, Leverage and Downgrade Impact The transaction, including cash consideration of GBP4.9bn is expected to  increase net debt / EBITDA from approximately 0.8x (YE14; based on unaudited  results) to 2.9x. Fitch guides that, subject to the take-up of the tender to Sky  Deutschland minorities, the transaction is likely to lead to a two-notch  downgrade of Sky's ratings, given the expected deleveraging that management has  guided to over the next two years. Unadjusted (net debt/EBITDA) leverage of 2.9x  (assuming no or minimal Sky Deutschland tender take-up) implies funds from  operations (FFO) net adjusted leverage of around 3.3x - verses a broad threshold  of 3.0x to sustain the ratings at 'BBB-'. Management's guidance of deleveraging  (on an unadjusted basis) of between 0.5x-0.7x by June 2016 should bring the FFO  metric back to an investment grade threshold.  Commitment to Investment Grade Rating Fitch considers Sky's management has a good track record in delivering results,  both operational and financially. Similarly, the execution and integration of  past acquisitions has been good; with financial policies managed to allow a  healthy level of headroom within targeted rating levels. Fitch acknowledges the  commitment that management has made to maintaining its investment grade rating  and that mitigating action is likely if leverage metrics might otherwise be  pressured by a high take-up of the Sky Deutschland minorities tender.  Funding for the transaction(s) including, a successfully completed secondary  share placement raising approximately GBP1.4bn, the cancellation of the share  buyback programme, along with disposals and asset contributions (ie. the recent  disposal of the ITV stake and contribution of its National Geographic stake as  part of the deal consideration), underline management's commitment to contain  the impact of the transaction on Sky's financial metrics.   Sky Deutschland Minorities Tender The risk of a sizeable take-up of the tender by Sky Deutschland's minorities is  not considered high given the absence of an acquisition premium. Take-up of the  tender could theoretically push metrics to a level that might be considered  stretched for an investment grade rating (a 100% take-up by minorities could  potentially push initial net debt/EBITDA leverage to 4.0x), However, this is not  our base case assumption, and Fitch believes mitigating action would be  available to management in the event take-up was higher than expected. Medium-Term Strategic Move In Fitch's view, the transaction(s) are about expanding Sky's addressable  audience. Management has a proven track record of delivering a high quality  pay-TV business in the UK and Ireland. However, the maturity and competition of  these markets may temper further growth, with management regarding the untapped  potential in Germany and Italy, as significant. The acquired businesses are  nonetheless significantly lower margin and the deal expected to be accretive  only in year 3. The agency recognises that management are taking a medium term  strategic view, with the challenge being to convince audiences in these  countries to embrace pay-TV in the way that British audiences do.        2014 Performance Sky reported FY14 results on 25 July, confirming 7% revenue growth to GBP7.6bn  and EBITDA down 1% to GBP1,667m (margin 21.9%). With 2014 a year of investment  amid rising competition in the UK pay-TV and multi-play markets, Sky continues  to perform well. Nonetheless, in Fitch's view, its pay-TV audience is mature and  the competitive environment intensifying; factors which we believe underpin the  proposed acquisition(s). Management has proven adept at expanding its product  offering, maintaining strong KPIs and ensuring the company's position as the  market leader in pay-TV. Operational performance/execution is regarded as  strong, although the announced deal underlines management's willingness to  accept a stretched capital structure in order to develop medium-term goals.       RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative Post-closing FFO net leverage sustainably above 3.0x would be likely to lead to  a downgrade from 'BBB-'; acknowledging that an 18-24 month timeframe will be  allowed before sustainable leverage is achieved.

60,"   By Jennifer Saba  Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox Inc is expected to make an aggressive case for merging with Time Warner Inc during its quarterly earnings call on Wednesday, though people familiar with the company's plans have said it would not use that forum to raise its bid.Time Warner is due to report its financial results on Wednesday as well, marking the first time executives from both companies will publicly speak since the offer was first revealed on July 16.It will be an opportunity for Time Warner Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes to defend his record for shareholder value. Fox's Chief Operating Officers Chase Carey and James Murdoch will have the chance to discuss the more than $1 billion in cost savings and powerful combination of cable networks and sports programing. It is unclear whether Rupert Murdoch, chairman and CEO of Fox, will make an appearance given the stakes.Fox has offered to buy Time Warner for about $80 billion, or about $85 per share, in a mix of cash and stock. Time Warner turned it down, saying its plan to go it alone ""is superior to any proposal"" from Fox. Though Fox is expected to raise its offer it will not rise beyond the range of $90 to $95 per share, a person familiar with Fox told Reuters on July 25. The timing of another offer is unclear. Some analysts have said that an even higher bid would be needed to win over Time Warner management and shareholders.A spokesman for Fox declined to comment. A potential tie-up would create one of the world's largest media conglomerates, dominating content production with two major studios, a stable of cable networks like Fox News and TNT, broadcast networks and pay-TV channel HBO.Faced with a rash of media distribution mergers, such as Comcast Corp's proposed $45 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable and AT&T's $48.5 billion deal to buy DirecTV, programing creators are responding with their own potential deals to add clout for negotiations with cable and satellite distributors and new entrants like Netflix and Amazon.Bernstein Research analyst Todd Juenger wrote in a note to investors on Friday that it would be in the interest of both companies to ink a deal. He and his team spoke to hundreds of Fox and Time Warner shareholders and concluded that ""most people are supportive."" ""To reject the $85 a share offer, you would have to believe that Time Warner would get to $95 a share on its own,"" he wrote. ""We don't find very many people who think it will be easy to get there.""A Time Warner spokesman declined to comment.With a backdrop of a rebuffed deal, Time Warner will be on the hook to explain why it is better off going solo. Time Warner has outpaced its peers with 15.2 percent earnings per share growth for the past 5 years, nearly double the median for its competitors, according to Thomson Reuters data.""Can Time Warner demonstrate to shareholders that left alone, the value to shareholders would be meaningfully greater than the $85 bid on the table from Fox?"" Alan Gould, managing director at Evercore Partners Inc, asked in a research note.For now, Gould pointed out that there does not seem to be an alternative bidder.

61,"   By Jennifer Saba and Soyoung Kim  Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) decided to pull its $80 billion offer to buy Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) on Tuesday, abandoning plans to create one of the world's largest media conglomerates.The surprise announcement appeared to cut short what many investors had viewed as an inevitable battle of attrition over a deal that would have joined two of Hollywood's biggest studios and TV networks from TNT to Fox News.     Murdoch, who is Fox's chairman and CEO, cited Time Warner's management and its board's refusal to come to the table to discuss a takeover as one reason for the stunning turnabout.    ""Our proposal had significant strategic merit and compelling financial rationale and our approach had always been friendly. However, Time Warner management and its board refused to engage with us to explore an offer which was highly compelling,"" he said in a statement released after the market closed on Tuesday.    Murdoch also cited Fox's share price - down about 11 percent since the offer was unveiled on July 16 - saying it had become undervalued, making the deal ""unattractive to Fox shareholders."" Time Warner, which had fiercely resisted Murdoch's advance,  issued a statement saying it was committed to enhancing long-term value. ""We look forward to continuing to deliver substantial and sustainable returns for all stockholders,"" the statement said.    Shares of Fox rose 10.4 percent in after-market trade after closing at $31.30. Shares of Time Warner fell 10.7 percent after closing at $85.19.A source familiar with the matter said that there were no other likely bidders for Time Warner at this point. Still, Time Warner shares are trading at a premium to the offer suggesting that some investors believe another buyer could emerge or Fox may return. Fox, which split off from News Corp last year, is serious about walking away from Time Warner, additional people familiar with the matter said, citing its announcement of a $6 billion stock buyback at the same time. The people were not authorized to speak to the media about the deal. 'NEGOTIATING STRATEGY'?   Still, Fox's withdrawal will raise pressure on Time Warner to justify its refusal to engage in negotiations, the drop in its stock price after the announcement and the fact that bolstered takeover defenses by barring its shareholders from calling a special meeting, said Brett Harriss, an analyst with Gabelli & Co, who said Fox could still try again later.""This could easily be part of their negotiating strategy,"" he said.Both Fox and Time Warner are set to report their quarterly earnings on Wednesday and will face questions from investors and analysts about their future strategies.The combined companies would have created a media powerhouse with two major studios, cable networks, sports programming and pay-TV channel HBO. A tie-up would have added more muscle to negotiate against media distribution companies that have been going through their own mergers like Comcast's (CMCSA.O) deal to buy Time Warner Cable TWC.N and AT&T's (T.N) proposal to takeover DirecTV DTV.O. The move to walk away is an uncharacteristic one for Murdoch, the 83-year-old media mogul known for his deal-making prowess. He pounced on Dow Jones in 2007, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, after making an offer to the Bancroft family that was too good to refuse.At $5 billion, representing roughly a 67 percent premium, many thought that Murdoch overpaid. News Corp had to write down  half the value a few years later.Jason Subotky, partner and portfolio manager at Yacktman Asset Management, a large Fox shareholder said, ""They showed a willingness to be bold with the proposal and yet were very disciplined. We think this is recognition that buying their own shares back is the most attractive use of capital at this point.""For now, today's statement from Murdoch signals that shareholder value trumps desire.      ""This significant return of capital underscores the company's ongoing commitment to disciplined capital allocation and returning value to shareholders in a meaningful way,"" Murdoch said in a statement, referring to the buyback plan.

63,"   By Jennifer Saba and Aurindom Mukherjee  Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) will not have to worry about any overtures from Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) for the foreseeable future.""As you know, yesterday, we walked away. This is our resolute decision,"" Fox Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rupert Murdoch said in a rare appearance on the company's conference call late Wednesday.Murdoch, conceding defeat, was further explaining the company's rational for pulling its bid on Tuesday.Fox Chief Operating Officer Chase Carey backed up Murdoch and went further: ""Let me be clear, we are done ... We have no plans to pursue any other third party content company as an alternative to Time Warner."" Earlier, Time Warner Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes, speaking on the company's own earnings conference call, also weighed in on the scuttled Fox bid, which the CNN and Warner Brothers studios owner had aggressively resisted, as well as the merits of megadeals in general.""I would just encourage everybody to look at all sides of the issue when contemplating the benefits and risks of putting very large companies together,"" Bewkes said to an analyst.Indeed, since taking the helm of the media conglomerate in 2008, Bewkes has trimmed down Time Warner - shedding properties like AOL AOL.N, Time Warner Cable TWC.N, and Time Inc (TIME.N) - and making it an attractive target for acquisitive-hungry rivals.Bewkes said he feels that Time Warner is already at scale, especially for its studio business Warner Bros which he described as the ""biggest producer of content in the world"" to its collection of cable networks which also dominate.""We are not lacking something we need,"" he said. Time Warner needs to show it can go it alone after fiercely refusing to engage in talks with Fox, which offered to buy it in a deal for about $80 billion and would have created one of the world's largest media companies with two major studios, a bevy of cable networks and pay-TV channel HBO.   Time Warner reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday and boosted its share buyback program by an additional $5 billion. ""When faced with a hostile takeover bid, Time Warner did exactly what they should have done. They crushed the numbers,"" wrote Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson Research in a note to investors.The strong results and shareholder-friendly measure could not prevent Time Warner's stock from sliding. The shares closed down 13 percent at $74.24 - well below the $85 per share offer from Rupert Murdoch's Fox.Time Warner said it will host an investor's day in the fall to unveil more details about its long-term strategy. 'GAME OF THRONES' Revenue from Time Warner's Home Box Office unit jumped 17 percent to $1.42 billion for the second quarter, helped by the popularity of ""Game of Thrones"" and other HBO shows.    The company said the fourth season of ""Game of Thrones,"" which ended in June, was the most watched season of an original series in HBO's history. The Emmy award-winning fantasy epic had an average gross audience of 19 million viewers. The company's Turner Networks unit — home to CNN, TBS and TNT — also posted an increase in revenue on higher subscription and advertisement sales.Net income from continuing operations attributable to Time Warner common shareholders rose to $843 million, or 94 cents per share, for the three months ended June 30, from $698 million, or 73 cents per share, a year earlier.On an adjusted basis, the company earned 98 cents per share.Revenue increased to $6.79 billion from $6.61 billion.Analysts, on average, had expected a profit of 84 cents a share on revenue of $6.87 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company forecast full-year 2014 adjusted profit growth in the low teens in terms of percentage, off a base of 2013 adjusted earnings of $3.51 per share.Time Warner said in April it expected its full-year adjusted profit to grow in the low- to mid-teen percentage range, or better, for at least the next three or four years.

68,"   By David Gaffen  Many options traders who had taken bets on a successful buyout of Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) by Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) are facing a grim lesson in the risks of betting on deals. Murdoch pulled the $80 billion offer after the close of trading on Tuesday, saying Time Warner management had refused to engage in discussions. He also cited the sharp drop in Fox's share price since the proposal last month, saying it ""makes the transaction unattractive to Fox shareholders.""Time Warner shares dove about 10 percent to $76.80 from $85.19 following news of the offer's withdrawal, while Fox's stock gained around 9 percent.Expectations that Fox would increase its bid to at least $90  a share and even above $100 a share had prompted traders and investors to put down a series of bets.There are more than 25,000 out-of-the-money call option contracts expiring in mid-October that anticipate Time Warner to close at a price anywhere between $90 a share and $105 a share. Each call or put option contract represents the right to buy or sell 100 shares at a particular price.There are more than 12,700 outstanding contracts that bet on Time Warner shares to close above $92.50 by mid-October. Just after the Fox bid, those options surged to trade at a peak of $3.09 each. Since then hopes of a deal had diminished as Time Warner made it clear it didn't want to talk to Fox about a deal. The mid-October options closed Tuesday at $1.20 each and are expected to fall sharply when the market opens on Wednesday. If a trader had bought all those contracts at the peak, the cost would have been about $3.92 million. They are now worth about $1.52 million and the value is expected to drop much further. Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives with the Schwab Center for Financial Research, in Austin, Texas, said that if Time Warner shares do indeed open about $10 lower on Wednesday, the mid-October options would likely see their value drop to about 10 or 11 cents.“You’re looking at a 90 percent drop in value,” he said. “Unless they got those positions before the announcement, they probably paid a lot and were looking to get a small gain.” Indeed, that looks like a distinct possibility if Tuesday's after hours swoon in Time Warner shares continues into trading on Wednesday.  VALUATION CONCERNS There are also plenty of positions expiring in August and September that are in danger of turning into losers. More than 17,000 call options contracts in Time Warner that expect a close above $85 currently trade at $1.65 each option - and they expire next week. At their peak, those contracts would have cost $6.89 million and are now worth about $2.81 million.  Notably, trading on Time Warner options on Tuesday was dominated by put buying, according to J.J. Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist for TD Ameritrade. Activity in puts outweighed action in calls by nearly a three-to-one ratio, which Kinahan said was primarily investors buying puts as a protective move by those holding Time Warner shares. At least one asset manager who bailed on the stock before the announcement said Time Warner just looked too pricey at the Fox offer price of around $85 a share.""We compared Time Warner to Netflix and Amazon and felt it was way too rich in terms of valuation,"" said Diane Garnick, CEO of asset management firm Clear Alternatives LLC in New York. Her firm sold the stock last week. She said millennials represent a growing part of those who view content but don't use cable as much as older generations. One event investor, who are commonly called arbitrageurs, said he was relieved he had avoided the temptation to get in on the buy-Time Warner-sell-Fox trade after Fox's offer was first made public in mid-July.""Thankfully we stayed away,"" said the investor, who declined to be identified. ""Lots of event and arb funds had the long Time Warner and short Fox trade on. I don't think many avoided it.""

69,"  News Corp (NWSA.O), publisher of the Wall Street Journal, reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue as growth in its book publishing business helped to make up for a decline in revenue in its bigger news and information division.News Corp, whose shares were up marginally at $17.50 in after-market trading on Thursday, has been focusing more on book publishing as its newspaper business struggles with weak ad spending in an increasingly digital world.The results mark the first full year since controlling shareholder Rupert Murdoch separated his publishing assets from his entertainment and cable TV businesses, which are now housed in 21st Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O).Apart from the Journal, News Corp's properties include the Australian newspaper, book publishers HarperCollins and Harlequin Enterprises, stakes in Australian pay-TV and digital real estate businesses, and education company Amplify.Revenue from book publishing rose about 10 percent to $361 million in the fourth quarter ended June 30, helped by the popularity of the ""Divergent"" series of young-adult science fiction novels by Veronica Roth published by HarperCollins. Book publishing accounts for about 16.5 percent of the company's total revenue.Revenue in the company's news and information division fell 6.2 percent to $1.56 billion as both ad revenue and subscription sales dropped.Total revenue fell 3 percent to $2.19 billion, slightly beating the average estimate of $2.17 billion.

70,"   By Akane Otani | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Stocks ended lower on Thursday, continuing a recent streak of weakness as Russia's surprisingly harsh retaliatory measures in response to Western sanctions raised concerns about global growth.In addition to Moscow's ban on imports of many Western foods, following sanctions imposed for Russia's support of rebels in eastern Ukraine, investors worried that the conflict between Russian and Ukraine is escalating, with the downing of a Ukrainian fighter jet.The declines briefly dragged the Dow below its 200-day moving average in afternoon trading. The S&P 500 is now nearly 4 percent below the record closing high it set last monthWhile the full extent of the sanctions are still unknown, escalating tensions in Russia could continue to spur selling in stocks, analysts said.""Before this point, U.S. investors have always thought of geopolitical concerns as being largely no more than a 24-hour event. Now, the growing concern is that the outlook for global growth is pointing down,"" said Andrew Wilkinson, chief market analyst at Interactive Brokers Group in Greenwich, Connecticut. ""To that extent, investors seem more prone to selling, and asking questions later rather than buying the dip as they had become accustomed to doing in the past.""All but one of the S&P 500's industry sectors ended down on the day, backtracking from brief gains in the morning. Consumer staples shares .SPCOMS, the bright spot of trading on Wednesday, slipped 0.8 percent on Thursday, while utilities .SPCOMU shares posted the sole sector gains. Health insurer stocks were poor performers, dipping after Goldman Sachs downgraded Aetna (AET.N) to ""neutral"" and cut earnings estimates on a number of its peers. Aetna (AET.N) shares slid 4.0 percent to $75.22, UnitedHealth Group (UNH.N) shares lost 2.7 percent to $79.26 and Cigna shares (CI.N) fell 3.0 percent to $88.75.The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 75.07 points, or 0.46 percent, to 16,368.27, the S&P 500 .SPX ended down 10.67 points, or 0.56 percent, to 1,909.57, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC lost 20.09 points, or 0.46 percent, to 4,334.97.Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) surged 5.1 percent to $33.97 after the company's quarterly profit beat Wall Street's expectations. Jobless claims reports lent optimism to the market in the morning as the four-week claims average fell to its lowest level since February 2006, suggesting labor market conditions are continuing to improve. About 5.5 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, compared with the five-day average of 6.9 billion.

74,"   By Kylie MacLellan | LONDON  LONDON WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has spent over two years in Ecuador's London embassy to avoid a sex crimes inquiry in Sweden, said on Monday he planned to leave the building ""soon"", but Britain signaled it would still arrest him if he tried.   Assange made the surprise assertion during a news conference alongside Ecuador's Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino. But his spokesman played down the chances of an imminent departure, saying the British government would first need to revise its position and let him leave without arrest, something it has repeatedly refused to do.The 43-year-old Australian fled to the embassy in June 2012 to avoid extradition for questioning in Sweden over sex assault and rape allegations, which he denies. He says he fears that if extradited to Sweden he would then be handed over to the United States, where he could be tried for one of the largest information leaks in U.S. history. Assange would be arrested if he exited the London embassy because he has breached his British bail terms.""I am leaving the embassy soon ... but perhaps not for the reasons that Murdoch press and Sky news are saying at the moment,"" Assange told reporters at the embassy in central London. Britain's Sky News, part owned by Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox, had earlier reported that Assange was considering leaving the embassy due to deteriorating health.'CALL OFF THE SIEGE' WikiLeaks began releasing thousands of confidential U.S. documents on the Internet in 2010. That embarrassed the United States, and some critics say it put national security and people's lives at risk. Ecuador later granted Assange political asylum. But he was unable to leave Britain and has ended up living in the embassy's cramped quarters in central London. His comments briefly raised the possibility of his leaving imminently. But Kristinn Hrafnsson, his spokesman, told reporters that he could only do so if the British government ""calls off the siege outside"". Assange had no intention of handing himself over to the police, he added.  Ecuador's Patino said he would try to hold talks with his British counterpart to resolve the case. Recent changes to British extradition laws may mean Assange would not be facing extradition if his case had just started.  Britain's Foreign Office said it remained as committed as ever to reaching a diplomatic solution to the problem, but reiterated that Assange still needed to be extradited. ""As ever we look to Ecuador to help bring this difficult, and costly, situation to an end,"" a spokeswoman said. The Assange issue has put Britain and Ecuador at odds, with London angered by the decision of Ecuador's socialist President Rafael Correa to grant him asylum and Quito unhappy at the British refusal to allow him safe passage.Asked about his health, Assange said anyone would be affected by spending two years in a building with no outside areas or direct sunlight, a complaint he has made several times before.

76,"   By Andrew Chung | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Fox News cannot stop a media monitoring service from recording snippets of its broadcasts and offering them to clients, some of which use them to criticize the network, a New York federal judge ruled on Tuesday.Fox, which is owned by Twenty-First Century Fox Inc, sued TVEyes Inc for copyright infringement in 2013, calling it a ""parasitic"" service that was leeching profits from its considerable investments in producing content for its cable channels. U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein in Manhattan disagreed, saying TVEyes' copying and indexing of the clips fairly used the cable news channel's content in line with copyright law. He denied Fox's demand for an injunction against TVEyes. A representative of Fox News said the court reserved judgment on whether other aspects of TVEyes' database - the ability to archive and email clips, for instance - also amount to fair use. Another hearing is set for Oct. 3.   The Connecticut-based TVEyes' clients include the U.S. Army, the White House, members of Congress, and local and state police departments, which use it to track news coverage of events, according to Hellerstein. He said Internet searches would not yield as comprehensive results as a search of TVEyes.  ""Thus, without TVEyes, this information cannot otherwise be gathered and searched,"" the judge said. It was this factor that made TVEyes' service ""transformative,"" he explained, a key factor in determining whether any infringement occurred. Based on its clients' many uses of the service, Hellerstein added, TVEyes ""provides substantial benefit to the public."" ""We are very pleased with the decision,"" TVEyes Chief Executive Officer David Ives said in an email. TVEyes argued in court filings that another benefit of the service is that it facilitates criticism of Fox. It singled out one client, the George Soros-funded Media Matters, which monitors various media for ""conservative misinformation"" and frequently criticizes Fox. To halt this, TVEyes argued, would give Fox ""control over the public's right to continue to access information and effectively engage in political discourse."" The case is Fox News Network v. TVEyes Inc, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 13-cv-5315.

85,"  Oct 15 Time Warner Inc Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes stood in front of analysts and investors on Wednesday to seek to convince them that the company is better off alone after rejecting a bid from Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox.In doing so, he forecast adjusted earnings per share of $6 by 2016 and $8 by 2018.Shares of Time Warner, which include movie studio Warner Bros, cable network Turner Broadcasting, and pay TV channel HBO, were up 2 percent at $72.05 in morning trading.

88,"  * Vivendi and ITI review options for 51 pct stake in Poland's TVN* Time Warner and 21st Century Fox seen as potential buyers* TVN shares jump 7 pct on newsBy Adrian Krajewski and Gwénaëlle BarzicWARSAW/PARIS, Oct 17 American media giants have been touted as potential buyers for Polish broadcaster TVN  after France's Vivendi and Poland-based holding company ITI signalled that they could sell their joint 51 per cent stake.ITI and Vivendi announced late on Thursday that they will conduct a review of their options for TVN, lifting shares in the broadcaster by as much as 7 poercent in early trading on Friday.A sale would open an opportunity for another big media player to enter Poland's rebounding market of 38 million people, with analysts naming Time Warner and Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox as prospective buyers.Vivendi's Canal Plus agreed to buy into TVN, one of Poland's two largest private broadcasters, three years ago. A wider deal also included a merger of the two sides' pay-TV platforms into nc+, which made Poland Vivendi's second-largest market.Canal Plus said it would rather focus on nc+, Poland's second-largest pay TV platform with 2.2 million users, as part of a broader strategy of moving away from free-to-air television, where advertising revenues are threatened by the Internet and on-demand TV viewing. ""The timing is not bad,"" Espirito Santo analyst Konrad Ksiezopolski said. ""The advertising market in Poland is gaining steam, TV ads are rising and despite the Internet's growing popularity it is still the strongest advertising channel.""""Per capita spending on TV advertising is still low in Poland, even in comparison with the Czech Republic or Hungary, which indicates a chance for growth.""TVN and Canal Plus originally expected their tie-up to bring in annual savings of more than 250 million zlotys ($76 million) in its third year, with core profit of 550 million zlotys in 2015. Instead, the third year could bring an ownership overhaul.""No timetable has been set. Every option is open,"" a source familiar with the matter said, adding that Bank of America Merrill Lynch and JP Morgan have the mandate for the option review. The source added that the Polish TV market is becoming increasingly competitive, with a possible launch by U.S. video-streaming company Netflix next year.SELLING SPREE Canal Plus is losing customers in its domestic market to widely available free channels, prompting the move to expand internationally by focusing on businesses in Poland, Vietnam, French-speaking Africa and more recently in Canada. Under a two-year strategic overhaul, Vivendi sold its French telecoms operator SFR and video games maker Activision Blizzard.After the SFR sale, Canal Plus will be Vivendi's largest results driver, bringing in about 40 percent of operating profit, compared with 33 percent for Vivendi's Universal Music Group and 27 percent for its Brazilian telecoms business GVT, which is also for sale.ITI, which has moved into multimedia from such disparate businesses as electronics imports and potato chips, is finishing its own clearout to cut debt costs, with TVN the last of its most-prized assets.Analysts told Reuters that Time Warner - owner of movie studio Warner Bros, cable network Turner Broadcasting and pay-TV channel HBO - could merge TVN with its Czech broadcaster CME.Time Warner rival Discovery Communications and Germany's Bertelsmann and RTL Group could also join the race.""If the transaction happens, it will be with a market premium,"" Raiffeisen analyst Dominik Niszcz said. ""Vivendi paid over 20 zlotys per share for its TVN stake and it can be assumed that it would want to book over 20 zlotys now.""After their initial jump, TVN shares were trading at 14.45 zlotys at 1435 GMT, up 0.3 percent on the day, valuing the company at about 5 billion zlotys.

95,"   By Jonathan Stempel and Dan Levine  A U.S. judge has rejected portions of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's lawsuit seeking to stop Dish Network Corp from selling devices that let viewers skip over commercials when playing back shows.In a decision made public on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles rejected copyright claims that Fox had brought over the Hopper, Dish's digital recording device.Gee invoked last June's U.S. Supreme Court decision against the video streaming company Aereo Inc in concluding that Dish's ""sling"" technology, which lets programs be viewed on a wide range of mobile devices, did not constitute a ""public performance"" that infringed Fox copyrights.However, Gee allowed Fox to pursue some claims on whether Dish violated a contract governing distribution of Fox programming. In a statement on Tuesday, Fox spokesman Scott Grogin said the company welcomed Gee's contract rulings, and was disappointed by her copyright findings.""This case is not, and has never been, about consumer rights or new technology,"" Grogin said.

""Consumers are the winners today, as the court sided with them on the key copyright issues in this case,"" the company said. The 63-page decision is dated January 12 and had been under seal. It may narrow the remaining litigation in a 3-year-old battle in which broadcasters accused Dish of using technology that infringed copyrights, and threatened advertising revenue by letting subscribers skip over commercials.CBS Corp and Walt Disney Co's ABC had settled similar litigation last year, as part of broader settlements allowing Dish to broadcast the networks' programs.

101,"   By David French | DUBAI  DUBAI Saudi Arabia's Kingdom Holding 4280.SE, the investment firm owned by billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, sold most of its stake in media giant News Corp (NWSA.O) as part of a portfolio review, it said on Wednesday.The sale of a 5.6 percent stake in News Corp generated 705 million riyals ($188 million) of cash for Kingdom and leaves it with a one percent holding, according to a bourse statement. The amount of profit or loss booked on the investment was not disclosed.Kingdom has held a stake in Rupert Murdoch's media conglomerate since 1997, according to its website.It has been a turbulent few years for the media company, after it emerged in 2011 that one of its British tabloid newspapers, the now-defunct News of the World, had been hacking phones and bribing public officials.News Corp said on Tuesday it would face no charges in the United States over the matter, although it still faces multiple investigations and court cases in Britain.""We remain firm believers in News Corp’s competent management, led by chief executive Robert Thomson, and are fully supportive of Rupert Murdoch and his family,"" Alwaleed said in a separate emailed statement. The action would not impact on Kingdom's 6.6 percent holding of Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O), the emailed statement added.Both News Corp and Twenty-First Century Fox were part of the same company until they were spun off into separate listed entities in June 2013, representing the previous firm's publishing and broadcasting businesses respectively. SALE PROCESS The sale of shares by Kingdom was ""predominantly executed"" in the first half of 2014 and finalised by the end of the year, the statement said.News Corp hit its highest level since the stock was split on Mar. 5, 2014, when it traded intraday at $18.53, and was as high as $18.29 on July 24 before slipping to an intraday low of $14.28 on Oct. 16, according to Thomson Reuters data. The media firm, which is due to report second-quarter earnings on Friday, closed on Tuesday at $15.61.Kingdom's stake decreased from 13.18 million class B shares, representing approximately 6.6 percent ownership, to 2 million class B shares, representing around 1 percent ownership.The funds generated from the sale will be reinvested elsewhere, the English-language bourse statement said.However, in an Arabic-language statement on the bourse website, Kingdom also said part of the proceeds will be used to reduce some of the company's debts.

104,"   By Nadia Damouni and Liana B. Baker | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Several top investors in Twenty-First Century Fox Inc are pressing for the right to swap their voting shares for ordinary shares, which are trading at an unusual premium, even though the move could hand even more control of the company to Rupert Murdoch, according to people familiar with the matter.Fox's dual-class share structure already gives the 83-year-old media mogul control over 39.7 percent of voting rights, even though he and his family hold only a 12 percent equity stake.Several Fox investors, which collectively own 8 percent of voting rights, have been unhappy about the relative performance of their shares since the company delisted from the Australian stock exchange last May, the people said.Historically, the voting shares had traded at a premium. In the five years before the delisting, the Class B shares, which carry voting rights, traded at an average premium of 6.2 percent over the ordinary Class A shares. But the delisting caused some Australian institutional funds to sell their B shares, which now trade at a 3 percent discount to the A shares.Frustrated with the gap, several top Fox shareholders have met with management in recent months to press for amendments to the company's charter to allow voting shares to be convertible into ordinary shares, according to the people, who requested anonymity as the discussions are private.They said the investors, which include major hedge funds, believe conversion rights would push up the value of the B shares, pointing to CBS Corp and Comcast Corp as examples. The voting shares of both companies can be converted and they trade at a premium to ordinary shares.Some of the Fox investors plan to take their proposals to the next annual general meeting, expected in the fall, said the sources familiar with the matter. Changing Fox's charter would require approval from a majority of shareholders with voting rights. It is unclear how much support there would be for this campaign. A Fox spokesman declined to comment. At least two major institutional investors said they had no desire to convert their shares and lose voting rights. Other shareholders may be wary that conversion would leave Murdoch with an even bigger share of the remaining voting shares. In the past, some pension funds and shareholder proxy advisors have criticized Murdoch's command over his media empire, and pushed to separate his chairman and chief executive roles, among other things.Fox, which owns the Twentieth Century Fox film studio as well as broadcast and cable television networks, was spun off from News Corp in 2013 amid shareholder pressure surrounding the phone hacking scandal involving Murdoch's newspapers in Britain. (News Corp's voting shares are also not convertible into ordinary shares.) Following the split, Fox chose to delist from the Australian stock exchange, in part to cut compliance costs and consolidate trading on the Nasdaq to boost liquidity in the U.S. market.The move forced Australian institutional funds that are not permitted to own foreign-listed securities to wind down their positions in Fox. That process is still going on, and has taken longer than some investors expected, people familiar with the matter said. Adding to the pressure, the voting shares have not so far been accepted on any S&P Dow Jones indices, whereas the ordinary shares have. S&P Dow Jones said the voting shares will be indexed in September, which would open them up to index mutual funds, exchange traded funds and index portfolios - that could help the voting shares rebalance. Fox's ordinary A shares have risen 3.8 percent over the past six months to $33.58, while the voting B shares have gained 2.7 percent to $32.57. The average A share trading volume per day is about 12 million shares, versus the B share volume is 4 million shares. There are 1.4 billion A shares and 800 million B shares. Some top Fox investors are willing to give up their voting rights because Murdoch already holds a controlling stake, the sources said. Even if Murdoch's voting rights increase, these funds believe it would not change the way the business is run. ""Once you own the controlling block that he does, the vote is not worth a terrible lot,"" said one of the sources.As for ordinary shareholders, the prospect of convertibility could be an overhang on the common shares, said Eddie Best, a lawyer specializing in capital markets at Mayer Brown LLP. Class B ""shareholders are unlikely to exercise their conversion rights if they don't have plans to sell,"" he said.

Following the split, Fox chose to delist from the Australian stock exchange, in part to cut compliance costs and consolidate trading on the Nasdaq to boost liquidity in the U.S. market.The move forced Australian institutional funds that are not permitted to own foreign-listed securities to wind down their positions in Fox. That process is still going on, and has taken longer than some investors expected, people familiar with the matter said. Adding to the pressure, the voting shares have not so far been accepted on any S&P Dow Jones indices, whereas the ordinary shares have. S&P Dow Jones said the voting shares will be indexed in September, which would open them up to index mutual funds, exchange traded funds and index portfolios - that could help the voting shares rebalance. Fox's ordinary A shares have risen 3.8 percent over the past six months to $33.58, while the voting B shares have gained 2.7 percent to $32.57. The average A share trading volume per day is about 12 million shares, versus the B share volume is 4 million shares. There are 1.4 billion A shares and 800 million B shares. Some top Fox investors are willing to give up their voting rights because Murdoch already holds a controlling stake, the sources said. Even if Murdoch's voting rights increase, these funds believe it would not change the way the business is run. ""Once you own the controlling block that he does, the vote is not worth a terrible lot,"" said one of the sources.As for ordinary shareholders, the prospect of convertibility could be an overhang on the common shares, said Eddie Best, a lawyer specializing in capital markets at Mayer Brown LLP. Class B ""shareholders are unlikely to exercise their conversion rights if they don't have plans to sell,"" he said. As for ordinary shareholders, ""they might not love it but they might not have a choice,"" Best said.

A person familiar with the situation said Brooks, who rose in 14 years from the most junior newsroom position to edit the country's biggest selling newspaper, was likely to return to a role focusing on new digital and social media avenues.Brooks has not yet signed a contract and there is no timeline in place, the sources said. Under the proposal, she was likely to be based in Britain and would work with Storyful, a 2013 News Corp acquisition that discovers, verifies and acquires news and footage on social media networks.The head of Storyful will remain in place, the person said.   The company, which declined to comment, had previously said Brooks traveled to New York in October last year to explore job opportunities there.  If agreed, the role will mark the first time the 46-year-old has returned to News Corp since she quit in July 2011 amid a firestorm sparked by revelations that staff at the News of the World tabloid had hacked into the phones of thousands of people to break news. Brooks, who edited both the now-defunct Sunday tabloid and Murdoch's daily Sun newspaper, had by then become the chief executive of News International, Murdoch's British newspaper arm now called News UK.

Having stepped down from that role, Brooks was arrested and later charged with being part of a conspiracy to hack into phones to find exclusive stories, of authorizing illegal payments to public officials and of trying to hinder the police investigation.  She denied all the charges and was found not guilty in June 2014 after an eight-month trial.Brooks, who was regularly pictured by Murdoch's side and was a close friend of the last three British prime ministers including David Cameron, had previously focused on the company's digital growth during her time as the head of News International.

122,"  NEW YORK, April 10 News Corp and 21st Century Fox, controlled by Rupert Murdoch, are in talks to build a joint headquarters in a new 88-story skyscraper at the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan, The New York Times said on Friday.The companies have been in talks for months with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and developer Larry Silverstein, who has the rights to build the fourth and last office tower at the World Trade Center, the Times said.The newspaper cited real estate and government officials who asked not to be identified because a deal had not been finalized. ""21st Century Fox and News Corp are each exploring options for their New York headquarters and the process is ongoing,"" a spokesman for News Corp told Reuters. Silverstein Properties did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment. A deal would complete the rebuilding of the office complex destroyed on Sept. 11, 2001, and solidify the transformation of Lower Manhattan into a technology and media hub.Conde Nast Publications, The Daily News, Time Inc, McGraw-Hill, American Media Inc and MediaMath are moving to the area once known for its financial institutions, the Times said.

123,"   By Jennifer Saba  Saudi Arabia's Prince Alwaleed bin Talal is in no doubt that James Murdoch is ready to take a much bigger role at Twenty-First Century Fox, by far the largest part of the media empire that James' father Rupert Murdoch built. ""James is a giant!"" said Alwaleed, a Murdoch family ally and one of Fox’s top shareholders with a 6.6 percent voting stake, in an interview. In particular, Alwaleed points to what he says is James' ability to grasp the digital world and understand how it is transforming the media landscape, adding: ""I really love him!"" The billionaire prince's seal of approval - and increasing acceptance of James by other shareholders - may be laying the ground for Fox to give the 42-year-old day-to-day control of the company sooner rather than later. One person familiar with the family's thinking said James, who is currently co-chief operating officer with Chase Carey, could take over fully from Carey - who also holds the title of president - as early as the end of this year.The source cautioned that the change hasn't been formalized and could be subject to delay. It is also unclear what title James would take or whether there is any possibility that Rupert Murdoch, 84, would relinquish the Fox CEO position to him anytime soon.Carey's contract is set to expire on June 30, 2016, but he can leave the company as early as the end of this year with six months notice. Fox declined to comment. James Murdoch declined to be interviewed for this article.What is clear is that some key investors seem to be warming to the idea that James has the chops to run Fox. That was not always the case. In interviews, some top investors who know James, and other people familiar with the company, describe him as curious and a risk taker like his father. But they also cite two big differences that they like: James is less sentimental about certain assets than his dad and he is more enthusiastic about courting shareholders.In 2013, James and his older brother Lachlan, 43, were elected as directors of Fox – but only on the strength of votes  cast by the family. Assuming the Murdoch family and Alwaleed voted for the two sons (the prince has previously said he tends to vote with the Murdochs), it means that 71 percent of the rest of the shareholders voting opposed James – and 90 percent cast their votes against Lachlan.In contrast, after James was made co-COO and Lachlan co-chairman of Fox last year, only 24 percent of the independent stakeholders voting opposed both their board nominations if the same voting assumptions for the family and Alwaleed are correct.  Fox declined to comment on those assumptions.James ""really works hard just like his father,"" said Saad Mohseni, chairman and CEO of the Afghan media company Moby Group, in which Fox holds a stake. ""He doesn't get the benefit of the doubt. For him, every step of the way he has to prove himself."" If James gets Carey's role he will be running the day-to-day operations of a sprawling media behemoth with a market value of close to $73 billion. It owns cable assets, broadcast networks and movie studios, including Twentieth Century Fox movie studio, Fox News and Star India.The Murdochs own 39 percent of voting shares in Fox and News Corp, the company that operates newspapers like The Wall Street Journal and book publisher HarperCollins, through a family trust. Fox split from News Corp in 2013.The prospect of a Fox completely run by the Murdochs does still concern some investors.Many shareholders say they have great respect for Carey, 61, a long-time Murdoch lieutenant who has worked in the role since 2009. The thinking: Carey is not only a good operator but he also keeps the family in check  - especially when acquisitions are concerned.""We are very happy with how things are now,"" said one top Fox shareholder, adding that having the Murdochs running the show in the top three positions without having anyone to provide an alternative voice wasn't a comfortable prospect. PHONE HACKING SCANDAL A Harvard drop out, James spent his early career as a cartoonist and co-founder of hip hop label Rawkus Records, which was bought by News Corp.He joined News Corp in 1996, at the age of 23 and was soon installed as head of the company's Asian assets, including Star India. Four years later, he was named CEO of BSkyB, now known as Sky, that is 39 percent owned by Fox.People close to James said one of his weaknesses was that he wasn't humble about getting big roles at the company from such an early age. He never quite accepted that he only got those jobs because he was Rupert's son, said one of these people. Still, they said James has now matured and that while he may have been brash at times when he was younger he was successful in improving the group’s businesses in Asia and Europe. By far the biggest setback James faced was when he was in charge of News Corp's British newspapers and he had to deal with the phone hacking scandal at its UK tabloid newspaper The News of the World, which was closed as a result. Some of the paper's journalists were alleged to have illegally tapped phones and bribed officials in pursuit of stories. While the alleged hacking occurred before James took charge, his critics said he failed to recognize the significance of the problem and didn't conduct as thorough an internal investigation as necessary. In one oversight, he admitted he didn't fully read an email sent to him in 2008 detailing allegations against the paper that were made by the English soccer players union. However, a British parliamentary committee cleared James of any wrongdoing and the U.S. Department of Justice declined to prosecute News Corp and Fox after an investigation. James left London for New York in 2012.      FACEBOOK NO MORE? For the past three years, James has worked with Carey and other Fox executives to learn about the U.S. media market and repair the damage to his reputation. He has started to emerge at industry functions like the annual media mogul confab in Sun Valley and as a keynote speaker at industry conferences. One person who knows the family said that Rupert has been indifferent to investors his entire career. ""James is more sensitive,"" this person said. Rupert Murdoch has often been perceived to do what he likes, especially as it concerns acquisitions, several investors said. One example that is often raised is News Corp’s $5.6 billion purchase in 2007 of Dow Jones, the publisher of the Wall Street Journal, an investment that was later written down by half. Several sources say James played a key role in the decision not to make a hostile bid for Time Warner last year. He assured investors that Fox was going to be cautious on how fast and how aggressive it would be in its pursuit of Time Warner, fearing that it could overpay. He was instrumental in last year's consolidation of its European pay-TV assets that led to BSkyB buying Fox’s stakes in Sky Deutschland and Sky Italia, resulting in a new pan-European pay TV company Sky according to people familiar with the matter. Along with those big investments he was also involved in some of Fox's digital investments in the next generation of advertising and TV viewing, including the purchase of a 5 percent stake in Vice, the acquisition of True [X], which helps broadcasters sell digital advertising, and an investment in Roku, the streaming video player, sources said.""Every time I look behind me or I look ahead of me, I see James,"" said David Zaslav, CEO of Discovery Communications.Prince Alwaleed even says if James had been at the helm he could have prevented one of the Murdoch empire's most embarrassing stumbles - News Corp's failure to develop MySpace after buying the social media site in 2005.  ""MySpace would now be flying,"" Alwaleed said, ""and there would be no Facebook today.""

131,"   By Jennifer Saba and Nick Zieminski | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Rupert Murdoch, the 84-year old media baron, will hand over the chief executive reins at entertainment conglomerate Twenty-First Century Fox Inc to his 42-year-old son James, a source familiar with the situation said on Thursday.Fox Chief Operating Officer Chase Carey will step into an advisory role as part of a generational shift at the parent company of Fox News and movie studio behind ""X-Men"" and other series, the source said, adding that James Murdoch and his 43-year-old brother Lachlan would work as partners. The elder Murdoch, whose media career spans the better part of a century, will take on the role of executive chairman, according to published reports. While New York-based James will have day-to-day control of the company, Lachlan, who will be moving from Sydney to Los Angeles, will play an integral role as the company's co-executive chair. The wheels of this partnership were set in motion when Fox announced the brothers' promotions - Lachlan to non-executive co-chairman of both Fox and publishing operation News Corp and James to co-chief operating officer of Fox together with Carey - in March 2014. This will be the first time that only Murdoch family members will occupy the top three positions at the company. Fox said on Thursday it would take up the succession issue at its next board meeting, which the source said would take place next week.CNBC reported earlier that the elder Murdoch would still have the final say in whatever transpires at Fox. It was unclear whether the reorganization would take place this year or at the start of 2016, CNBC said.  'CAREY MUST NOT LEAVE' ""The most important thing in the immediate term is that Chase Carey not leave,” said Needham & Company Inc analyst Laura Martin. ""Wall Street really cares about Chase Carey running this business. So if the implication of Rupert handing the title to his son is that Chase Carey leaves in the near term, we would expect that to negatively impact the stock prices.""As of April, the Murdochs owned 39 percent of voting shares in both Fox and News Corp, which operates newspapers like The Wall Street Journal and book publisher HarperCollins, through a family trust. Fox split from News Corp in 2013. A Harvard University dropout, James spent his early career as a cartoonist and co-founder of hip hop label Rawkus Records, which was bought by News Corp. He joined News Corp in 1996 at 23 and soon ran the company's Asian assets. He was later named CEO of BSkyB, now known as Sky, that is 39 percent owned by Fox.Some key investors have been warming to the idea that James has the ability to run Fox, describing him as curious and a risk-taker like his father. They also cite two big differences that they like: James is less sentimental about certain assets than his father is, and more enthusiastic about courting shareholders.TIMING A SURPRISE  The reported executive moves were not surprising, but their timing is, Cowen & Co analysts said in a note to clients, noting that Fox could soon cut earnings estimates. That could set a new, lower bar for a new chief executive to target.""We have always viewed Rupert as an empire builder who is more concerned with accumulating assets than with delivering shareholder returns, highlighted most recently by the aborted attempt to take over Time Warner,"" the Cowen analysts said. Time Warner thwarted an $80 billion advance by Fox last year, in part by denigrating the non-voting stock that Rupert Murdoch was offering.Big acquisitions have long been standard operating procedure for Murdoch, who took an Australian newspaper chain and turned it into a global media superpower, buying storied properties such as the Times of London, The Wall Street Journal and Fox.

132,"   By Jennifer Saba and Nick Zieminski | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Rupert Murdoch, the 84-year old media baron, will hand over the chief executive reins at entertainment conglomerate Twenty-First Century Fox Inc to his 42-year-old son James, a source familiar with the situation said on Thursday.Fox Chief Operating Officer Chase Carey will step into an advisory role as part of a generational shift at the parent company of Fox News and movie studio behind ""X-Men"" and other series, the source said, adding that James Murdoch and his 43-year-old brother Lachlan would work as partners. The elder Murdoch, whose media career spans the better part of a century, will take on the role of executive chairman, according to published reports. While New York-based James will have day-to-day control of the company, Lachlan, who will be moving from Sydney to Los Angeles, will play an integral role as the company's co-executive chair. The wheels of this partnership were set in motion when Fox announced the brothers' promotions - Lachlan to non-executive co-chairman of both Fox and publishing operation News Corp and James to co-chief operating officer of Fox together with Carey - in March 2014. This will be the first time that only Murdoch family members will occupy the top three positions at the company. Fox said on Thursday it would take up the succession issue at its next board meeting, which the source said would take place next week.CNBC reported earlier that the elder Murdoch would still have the final say in whatever transpires at Fox. It was unclear whether the reorganization would take place this year or at the start of 2016, CNBC said.  'CAREY MUST NOT LEAVE' ""The most important thing in the immediate term is that Chase Carey not leave,” said Needham & Company Inc analyst Laura Martin. ""Wall Street really cares about Chase Carey running this business. So if the implication of Rupert handing the title to his son is that Chase Carey leaves in the near term, we would expect that to negatively impact the stock prices.""As of April, the Murdochs owned 39 percent of voting shares in both Fox and News Corp, which operates newspapers like The Wall Street Journal and book publisher HarperCollins, through a family trust. Fox split from News Corp in 2013. A Harvard University dropout, James spent his early career as a cartoonist and co-founder of hip hop label Rawkus Records, which was bought by News Corp. He joined News Corp in 1996 at 23 and soon ran the company's Asian assets. He was later named CEO of BSkyB, now known as Sky, that is 39 percent owned by Fox.Some key investors have been warming to the idea that James has the ability to run Fox, describing him as curious and a risk-taker like his father. They also cite two big differences that they like: James is less sentimental about certain assets than his father is, and more enthusiastic about courting shareholders.TIMING A SURPRISE  The reported executive moves were not surprising, but their timing is, Cowen & Co analysts said in a note to clients, noting that Fox could soon cut earnings estimates.

136,"  * Ten would join Foxtel in sports rights bid* Competition regulator will consider level of shareholding - Sims* Regulator blocked another TV-Foxtel partnership in 2012* TV advertising industry weak   (Adds ACCC chairman comment)By Byron KayeSYDNEY, June 15 Unprofitable Australian television broadcaster Ten Network Holdings Ltd said it plans to sell a 15 percent stake in itself to the local cable TV arm of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, in a lifeline deal that may face regulatory snarls. Ten, which warned in April that it may not survive a downturn in free-to-air advertising, said on Monday the shares will be offered at A$0.15 each, a 43 percent discount to its closing price on Friday. The A$77 million ($59 million) from the sale will be used to cut debt, it said, and added that it wants to raise another A$77 million with a rights issue.But Australia's chief antitrust regulator said a partnership with Foxtel, the cable TV firm half-owned by News Corp and Telstra Corp Ltd, could enable Ten to outbid larger free-to-air rivals Seven West Media Ltd and Nine Entertainment Co Holdings Ltd for prized sports broadcasting rights, raising concerns about anti-competitive behaviour. ""It's certainly an issue and we have those concerns but one has to take into account the level of the shareholding,"" Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Chairman Rod Sims told Reuters.In 2012, Sims blocked Seven from buying half of Foxtel's sports unit, citing concerns that it would lessen competition for sports rights. Sims then warned that he would stop News Corp from buying free-to-air TV assets for the same reason.Sims said a Ten-Foxtel tie-up might not raise the same level of concern because it involved News Corp taking a smaller stake in Ten than Seven had proposed three year years ago. Ten, which already has News Corp co-chairman Lachlan Murdoch among a host of high profile major shareholders, has consistently rated last behind Seven and Nine, and in 2014 appointed Citibank to help it decide its future amid reports of several takeover approaches.But the weak advertising market is affecting all three free-to-airs. Seven and Nine have watched their revenues decline in 2015 as more viewers switch to streaming video offerings from the newly-launched local arm of Netflix Inc, as well as to their own video streaming ventures.Ten said it expects to take three months to obtain regulatory clearance so the sale would take place in October.Its shares fell as much as 6 percent after the announcement, but recovered to be trading down 2 percent at A$0.26, while the broader market was down 0.4 percent. Ten shares last traded at the proposed deal price of A$0.15 in 1993.

Heinz Co [HJHC.UL] and Smithfield Foods Inc [SFII.UL] may pursue their antitrust claims as a group, potentially boosting overall damages.News Corp spokeswoman Laura Adams said the company, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch, is reviewing Thursday's decision.The litigation is part of a long-running battle over News Corp's marketing operations.In January 2010, the New York-based company agreed to pay $500 million to end rival Valassis Communications Inc's [VCII.UL] antitrust lawsuit over the newspaper coupon market.News Corp has an estimated 80 percent of the U.S. market for in-store promotion services, where it acts as a middleman to help companies promote goods through coupon dispensers, electronic signs, end-of-aisle displays and shopping cart ads. The plaintiffs said News Corp has monopolized this market since 2004 by locking up exclusive long-term contracts with retailers.They said this anticompetitive conduct has forced them to pay artificially high prices to promote such goods as Dial-brand soap, Heinz ketchup and Smithfield's Eckrich hot dogs.In certifying a class action from April 5, 2008, to the present, Pauley rejected News Corp's arguments that damages would be too hard to measure. He noted that the plaintiffs' damages expert estimated overcharges of 31 percent to 43 percent in the 2008-13 period.The judge also said ""central questions regarding liability"" for alleged supra-competitive prices were ""susceptible to common proof"" that could be addressed in a single trial.John Briody, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, declined to comment. Pauley said Valassis is News Corp's only remaining competitor in the in-store promotion services market.Valassis has also accused News Corp of unfairly dominating that market, and is suing the company in Detroit federal court.Heinz is owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) and Brazil's 3G Capital, and plans to merge as soon as next month with Kraft Foods Group Inc KRFT.O.Smithfield was bought in 2013 by the Chinese company now called WH Group Ltd (0288.HK).

147,"   By Leila Abboud | CANNES  CANNES James Murdoch, who will take the helm of Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) next week, said there was little he and his father Rupert did not agree on with respect to the future of the family media empire.At the Cannes Lions advertising conference on Thursday, the 42-year-old executive also said his relationship with brother Lachlan, who will be elevated to a co-executive chairman in the recently announced reshuffle was ""very much a partnership"". While James and Lachlan are said by company sources to have a good relationship and approach the business as partners, the dual-reporting line could prove to be confusing and a source of tension, analysts have said.""The family is obviously a big shareholder in the business, so we are all really invested in each others' success,"" said Murdoch.""We all see very eye to eye on the business, so I think we're in reasonably good shape there."" Rupert Murdoch, who controls Fox through a trust that owns 39 percent of the voting shares, announced the long-expected elevation of his sons this month as he prepares the future of the company at a time of wrenching change in the television and entertainment businesses. James Murdoch will soon be running a sprawling media empire that owns cable assets, broadcast networks and movie studios, including Twentieth Century Fox, Fox News and Star India. Fox is also the largest shareholder in European pay-TV group Sky PLC (SKYB.L) with 39 percent.  The family spun off the newspaper business News Corp. (NWSA.O), long a passion of Rupert Murdoch, into a separate company in 2013. Some investors have questioned whether James is less attached to some parts of the media empire that his father built, such as the less profitable newspaper arm. The future of Fox's investment in Sky is also an issue after media reports of interest from European media group Vivendi (VIV.PA) and telecom operator Vodafone (VOD.L)James Murdoch did not comment on Thursday on those topics in particular, but did not mention News Corp. or Sky when asked what he thought the most promising areas of development were for the company. ""We are a global business and have always been so but I have to say we think India is the single greatest opportunity in the next five to ten years,"" he said, adding that Latin American and the United States were also bright spots.Asked whether he would one day like his own children to run the family business, Murdoch laughed. ""My kids are really little right now. I'd just like them to pass the fifth grade.""

Reuters reported in March that Brooks, the former editor of the News of the World tabloid and seen as Murdoch's protege, was in talks about returning to News Corp.""As we ‎have said, we have been having discussions with Rebekah Brooks and when we have any announcements to make we will let you know,"" a News Corp spokesman said on Friday.News UK, which covers Murdoch's British newspaper titles, declined further comment.If confirmed, the return to one of the biggest jobs in the British media would mark a stunning turnaround for Brooks who became one of the most talked about figures in British public life when the phone-hacking scandal broke.A public inquiry which ran through 2011 and 2012 heard of the close ties between senior executives at Murdoch's newspapers, the police and leading politicians, including Prime Minister David Cameron.Many admitted ‎they had got too close to Brooks as the revelation of regular gatherings at country homes gave the impression of a close knit establishment that had failed to hold itself to account. The investigation into what went wrong at the papers is also not complete. British prosecutors said on Friday they had received evidence relating to the phone-hacking investigation at the media baron's newspapers and were considering a possible corporate prosecution.HOUNDED Brooks rose in 14 years from the most junior newsroom position to edit Britain's biggest selling newspaper. She was a good friend of the last three British prime ministers, including Cameron, and was often pictured by Murdoch's side. She quit in July 2011 amid revelations that News of the World staff had hacked into the phones of thousands of people to break news.Evan Harris, a former British lawmaker and executive director of Hacked Off, a campaigning group for higher standards in journalism, said Brooks' return would not be acceptable in any other company.If confirmed, the return of Brooks could also ‎cause consternation amongst the victims of phone hacking. They told the court and the public inquiry how they felt hounded by the press and unable to trust anyone after private conversations appeared in the newspapers.As part of her defence, Brooks explained that she had had to work her way up through aggressive, male dominated newsrooms and often felt out of her depth as she was quickly promoted. Prosecutors charged that if she had not known about hacking in her newsroom, then she must have been incompetent.The scandal started in 2006 when the former royal editor of News of the World, Clive Goodman, and his investigator Glenn Mulcaire, admitted they had hacked the phones of royal aides.As revelations grew, police launched a wider investigation in 2011 under the code name Operation Weeting that led to the jailing for 18 months of the paper's ex-editor Andy Coulson.Brooks was arrested and charged with being part of a conspiracy to hack into phones to find exclusive stories, of authorising illegal payments to public officials and of trying to hinder the police investigation. She denied all the charges and was found not guilty in June 2014 after an eight-month trial.

She was a good friend of the last three British prime ministers, including Cameron, and was often pictured by Murdoch's side.She quit in July 2011 amid revelations that News of the World staff had hacked into the phones of thousands of people to break news.Evan Harris, a former British lawmaker and executive director of Hacked Off, a campaigning group for higher standards in journalism, said Brooks' return would not be acceptable in any other company. If confirmed, the return of Brooks could also cause consternation amongst the victims of phone hacking. They told the court and the public inquiry how they felt hounded by the press and unable to trust anyone after private conversations appeared in the newspapers.As part of her defence, Brooks explained that she had had to work her way up through aggressive, male dominated newsrooms and often felt out of her depth as she was quickly promoted.Prosecutors charged that if she had not known about hacking in her newsroom, then she must have been incompetent.The scandal started in 2006 when the former royal editor of News of the World, Clive Goodman, and his investigator Glenn Mulcaire, admitted they had hacked the phones of royal aides.As revelations grew, police launched a wider investigation in 2011 under the code name Operation Weeting that led to the jailing for 18 months of the paper's ex-editor Andy Coulson.Brooks was arrested and charged with being part of a conspiracy to hack into phones to find exclusive stories, of authorising illegal payments to public officials and of trying to hinder the police investigation.She denied all the charges and was found not guilty in June 2014 after an eight-month trial.

163,"   By Kate Holton and Paul Sandle | LONDON  LONDON Rebekah Brooks, the Rupert Murdoch protegee cleared last year of orchestrating a criminal campaign that damaged the British establishment, will return to her old job running the tycoon's British newspapers next week in a stunning comeback.Brooks, who worked her way up from the lowest rung on a newsroom ladder to become one of the most influential people in Britain, will resume oversight of the Sun and The Times of London papers on Monday following a high-profile fall from grace four years ago. With sales at the brash Sun tabloid in decline and a weak online presence, Brooks is being brought back to breathe new life into the group. She will be joined by Tony Gallagher as Sun Editor in Chief - a respected journalist and a key figure in the success of MailOnline, one of the most popular websites in the world. ""I am delighted to return to News UK,"" said Brooks, who was dubbed by some as Murdoch's ""fifth daughter"". ""It is a privilege to be back amongst the most talented journalists and executives in the business.""    Her return was condemned by critics of the company who questioned Murdoch's judgment in bringing back one of Britain's most vilified journalists who was once depicted as a witch on the front page of a news magazine over her role in a phone hacking scandal. Chris Bryant, an opposition lawmaker who has been an arch opponent of News Corp's aggressive tactics, said the 84-year-old Murdoch was ""sticking two fingers"" up to the British public by reappointing Brooks.  The 47-year-old quit in 2011 after the News of the World tabloid she had once edited admitted hacking into thousands of phones to generate stories, including the phone of a murdered schoolgirl.The admission sparked an uproar that rocked Murdoch's media empire, forcing the closure of the 168-year-old tabloid and a televised questioning in parliament of the Australian-born tycoon and his son James, both of whom apologized.The case cost the firm millions of pounds while a year-long public inquiry also exposed the close ties between senior News Corp executives including Brooks, the police and leading politicians including Prime Minister David Cameron. ""TWO FINGERS"" As the scandal engulfed his company and lawmakers who once sought his blessing lined up to criticize his firm, Murdoch showed his loyalty to Brooks by tipping her, its chief executive, as his main concern.""This one,"" he said, when asked for his top priority. Brooks was found not guilty of conspiring to hack into phones, bribing public officials for stories and perverting the course of justice following an eight-month trial which itself became front-page news.As part of her defense, Brooks explained that she had had to work her way up through aggressive, male-dominated newsrooms and often felt out of her depth as she was quickly promoted. Back in her old job, she will have to tackle the slide in sales of the Sun, Britain's biggest-selling newspaper and work with Gallagher, currently deputy editor at the Daily Mail and a former Telegraph newspaper editor, to build a stronger digital presence. Steven Barnett, professor of communications at the University of Westminster, said Brooks' return would be awkward for politicians who had previously acknowledged they had become too close to her when she was at the height of her powers.""It's another reason for questioning the judgment of Murdoch himself, because he must surely appreciate the political embarrassment caused at the time by her and those close to her,"" he said.

164,"  SYDNEY, Sept 14 A proposal by Rupert Murdoch's cable TV firm Foxtel to buy 15 percent of struggling broadcaster Ten Network Holdings Ltd may hurt competition, an Australian antitrust regulator said, in a sign that it may block the A$77 million share sale.Failure to clinch a deal would require loss-making Ten to recommence its search for a financial lifeline as it trails larger rivals Seven West Media Ltd and Nine Entertainment Co Holdings Ltd in the ratings and as more free-to-air viewers opt for streaming services like Netflix Inc.A key sticking point is the TV rights to big sporting events.Although Australian law prevents pay TV companies from buying exclusive broadcast rights to certain sports matches, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is worried that the proposal by Foxtel, of which Murdoch's News Corp  owns half, may make Foxtel less willing to negotiate with other TV networks. The deal ""may increase the likelihood of Ten and Foxtel entering into joint bids and other commercial arrangements for acquisition of sports rights, to the exclusion of other free-to-air networks"", ACCC chairman Rod Sims said in a statement on Monday.Ten said in a statement that it believes the proposal will increase competition in relevant markets. The ACCC noted that Murdoch's son, Lachlan Murdoch, owns 8.5 percent of Ten and is executive co-chairman and a likely shareholder of News Corp, saying ""if the interests of Foxtel and Mr Murdoch are aligned, this would be in effect the largest shareholding block in Ten"". The regulator will make a final ruling on Oct. 22.Ten shares climbed above Foxtel's proposed 15 cent acquisition price, rising 1 cent to 17.5 cents.

192,"  (Adds detail on social media)By Michael HoldenLONDON Jan 12 Media mogul Rupert Murdoch and former supermodel Jerry Hall got engaged over the weekend, announcing their plans to tie the knot in a classified ad on Tuesday in the Times newspaper, which is owned by Murdoch's News Corp.The 84-year-old executive chairman of News Corp and 21st Century Fox Inc and Hall, 59, became engaged in Los Angeles, where they had been attending Hollywood's Golden Globes awards ceremony on Sunday, the London newspaper reported.The three-times-married media tycoon and Hall - who is also a former actress and was the longtime romantic partner of Rolling Stones front man Mick Jagger - began dating last summer after being introduced by one of Murdoch's sisters and his niece while in Australia, the Times said.Murdoch, a native of Melbourne, Australia, and Hall, who hails from Gonzales, Texas, were first photographed together at the Rugby Union World Cup Final in London in October. ""They have loved these past months together, are thrilled to be getting married and excited about their future,"" a Murdoch family spokesman told the Times.The announcement, published in the paper's Births, Marriages and Deaths section, read: ""Mr Rupert Murdoch, father of Prudence, Elisabeth, Lachlan, James, Grace and Chloe Murdoch, and Miss Jerry Hall, mother of Elizabeth, James, Georgia and Gabriel Jagger, are delighted to announce their engagement."" The newspaper did not say whether the couple had announced a date for their nuptials.Murdoch divorced his third wife, Wendi Deng, a former executive at Murdoch-owned Star TV in China, in 2013 after 14 years, saying their marriage had been irretrievably broken. (reut.rs/1OYm3n6)In addition to the Times, Murdoch's News Corp newspapers include the Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and the Sun in Britain. Murdoch also controls 21st Century Fox,  which owns cable networks like Fox News and movie studios. Hall was married to Jagger for more than 20 years. However, in divorce proceedings in 1999, the British musician claimed they were never legally married.Before her relationship with Jagger, she had dated British pop star Bryan Ferry, front man of the band Roxy Music.On Twitter on Tuesday, ""Jerry Hall"" was one of the top-trending terms in Britain after news of the engagement broke. Many Twitter users expressed surprise, calling the Hall-Murdoch pairing an unusual match, and some indulged in snark.""So, Jerry Hall, what first attracted you to billionaire ... No, actually, I still don't understand it,"" tweeted actor David Schneider (@davidschneider).

195,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, January 22 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'BBB+' Issuer  Default Ratings (IDRs) of Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA) and its wholly  owned subsidiary 21st Century Fox America, Inc. (21CFA). Fitch has also affirmed  the specific issuer ratings assigned to 21st Century Fox America, Inc. The  Rating Outlook remains Stable.  Approximately $19.8 billion of debt outstanding as of Sept. 30, 2015, pro forma  for October 2015 maturities and subsequent issuances, is affected by Fitch's  action. A complete list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS --FOXA's portfolio of cable networks, including regional sports networks, and  leading brands underpin the ratings. Fitch believes these businesses position  the company with solid growth prospects and the ability to generate meaningful  levels of free cash flow (FCF). --Fitch expects that FOXA will use its excess liquidity to further reinvest in  its core businesses and growth initiatives while supporting shareholder returns  within the context of managing to its leverage target of between 2.5x and 3x.  --Shareholder returns (dividends and stock repurchases) that exceed FCF  generation are incorporated into current ratings to the extent that leverage  remains below Fitch's 3x total leverage threshold. --FOXA's liquidity position and financial flexibility remain strong for the  rating. Fitch anticipates FOXA will generate annual FCF between $2.5 billion -  $3.5 billion during the rating horizon. --FOXA is well positioned to address the secular threats and opportunities  presented by alternative digital distribution platforms and continued audience  fragmentation across the media and entertainment landscape. Fitch holds FOXA's overall strategic positioning in high regard, as its  businesses consist of a strong collection of cable and regional sports networks,  leading television and film studios, national television network with robust  sports-programming rights, and local television broadcast stations. Each of  FOXA's businesses has the scale characteristics to operate at high margins and  generate meaningful levels of FCF. In addition, they position the company to  address the secular threats and opportunities presented by changing media  consumption patterns and continued audience fragmentation across the media and  entertainment landscape. In Fitch's view they offer solid growth prospects and  the ability to generate meaningful levels of FCF, and, balanced against the  risks inherent within the company's operating profile, place FOXA solidly within  Fitch's parameters for a 'BBB+' rating. FOXA's financial priorities remain consistent. The company's leverage target of  between 2.5x and 3x, along with its $5 billion share repurchase program  highlight its capital allocation policy. FOXA is capitalizing on the capacity  and flexibility within its balance sheet and intends to repurchase $5 billion of  its common stock during fiscal 2016. FOXA reiterated its 2016 share repurchase  amount during the fourth-quarter 2015 (Q415) earnings call.  Outside of potential merger and acquisition activity, Fitch expects that FOXA  will continue investing in its core businesses and growth initiatives, and  support shareholder returns within the context of managing to its leverage  target. Shareholder returns that exceed FCF generation are incorporated into  current ratings, to the extent that leverage remains below Fitch's 3x total  leverage threshold. FOXA's capital structure and credit protection metrics remain stable and within  Fitch's expectations for the current rating. Consolidated leverage as of the  latest 12 months (LTM) ended Sept. 30, 2015 was 2.88x. Fitch estimates leverage,  pro forma for the repayment of 21CFA's $200 million of senior unsecured note due  October 2015 and issuance of $400 million of senior unsecured notes due 2045 and  $600 million of senior unsecured notes due 2025, is 3x. Fitch expects leverage  will be near the top end of the company's 2.5x to 3x leverage target during the  rating horizon.  Scheduled maturities are well laddered and manageable considering the company's  FCF, reliable market access and back-up liquidity. Upcoming maturities total  $400 million due during fiscal 2017 (8% senior debentures due October 2016) and  $350 million due during fiscal 2018 (7.25% senior debentures due May 2018). FOXA  repaid $200 million during the F2Q16 (7.6% senior debentures due October 2015).  FOXA is well positioned to address the secular threats and opportunities  presented by emerging alternative distribution platforms and continued audience  fragmentation across the media and entertainment landscape. The alternative  distribution platforms generate incremental demand for high-quality content  across all major end-markets (broadcast, cable networks and subscription video  on demand), and large, well-capitalized content providers such as FOXA will  remain crucial to the industry. The ratings incorporate expected earnings  volatility generated by the company's Filmed Entertainment segment, given the  general hit-driven nature of the movie industry.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: --Fitch anticipates low-double-digit affiliation fee growth. The revenue growth  within the company's cable network programming business reflects the company's  ability to secure affiliate fee rate increases. The company's investment in  original programming and acquisition of sports rights support affiliate fee  growth. --The ability to grow higher affiliate fee revenues at a similar pace as  programming costs will contribute to stable margins at the cable network  programming segment. From a margin perspective, the base case reflects the  company's investment in original programming and costs associated with acquired  programming.  --Fitch assumes typical volatility within the Filmed Entertainment business. The  Television segment benefits from the stable economy and growing retransmission  consent revenues while incorporating a typical political advertising revenue  cycle. Fitch assumes a slightly weaker television advertising environment as  digital media continues to take share from traditional advertising revenues.  Fitch expects political advertising to contribute to positive growth during  2016. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Positive rating action would likely coincide with FOXA adopting a more  conservative financial policy highlighted by a gross leverage target of 2x or  lower. Meanwhile, FOXA will need to demonstrate that its operating profile can  sustain itself amidst ongoing competitive pressures, changing media consumption  patterns and evolving technology platforms.  Negative: Negative rating actions are more likely to coincide with a material  shift in financial policy including, but not limited to, the company adopting a  more aggressive financial strategy or event-driven merger and acquisition  activity that drives leverage beyond 3x in the absence of a credible  de-leveraging plan while exhausting excess cash balances. A negative rating  action based solely on operational performance is unlikely over the short term. LIQUIDITY Fitch believes FOXA's liquidity position and financial flexibility are strong  for the rating given the strength of its businesses and expected FCF generation.  The company generated approximately $1.6 billion of FCF during the LTM period  ended Sept. 30, 2015. FCF generation is pressured somewhat due to the company's  increased investment in film and television production, and higher costs to  acquire programming (including sports programming) across the company's  portfolio of cable and television networks. The company's liquidity position is  supported by existing cash balance totaling $5.8 billion as of Sept. 30, 2015  ($950 million held by foreign subsidiaries as of June 30, 2015) and the  borrowing capacity from its $1.4 billion revolver which expires May 2020.   FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings with a Stable Outlook:  Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.  --IDR at 'BBB+'. 21st Century Fox America, Inc.  --IDR at 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured at 'BBB+'.

196,"   By Paul Sandle and Kate Holton | LONDON  LONDON James Murdoch is to return as chairman of Sky (SKYB.L) four years after a phone-hacking scandal forced him out, potentially taking the Murdoch family a step closer to a deal for full ownership of the European pay-TV group.Murdoch built Sky into a powerhouse in four years as chief executive officer and five as chairman, and was on the verge of selling it to U.S. media group 21st Century Fox (FOXA.O), owned by his father Rupert, before the scandal engulfed him.His appointment, seven months after becoming chief executive of Fox, follows Rebekah Brooks' return to lead Rupert Murdoch's newspaper business last year after being cleared of charges over the scandal at the News of the World newspaper, where reporters hacked into phones to obtain stories while she was the editor. Murdoch's return to a top job at Sky had seemed a remote possibility when he stood down in 2012, with politicians lining up to denounce the family for its domination of the British media and Prime Minister David Cameron acknowledging that politicians had got too close to his father Rupert. ""It's like Murdoch's getting the band back together, it's as if nothing ever happened at all,"" said a former executive from Murdoch's British arm.The admission of phone hacking, including the mobile phone of a murdered schoolgirl, led to a criminal trial, a national inquiry into media standards and a political backlash that forced Fox to abandon its bid for Sky. Rupert Murdoch closed the News of the World in 2011.In James Murdoch's absence, Sky bought Fox's German and Italian businesses, rolling Murdoch's European pay-TV assets into one company with 21 million customers and a London listing. It is 39 percent owned by the U.S. group.Buying all of Sky, which reported a better-than-expected 12 percent rise in profit and a record number of new customers on Friday, would add Europe's biggest pay-TV group to a media empire that spans U.S. network TV, Asia's Star and one of the most famous production businesses in the world. Recent results have shown that American TV networks are starting to struggle as viewers shift to online services such as Netflix (NFLX.O).  Sky's Chief Executive, Jeremy Darroch, said Murdoch, who was the only candidate put forward, was ""without a doubt the right man for the job"", underlining his deep knowledge of the international media industry and experience on the board.He acknowledged there would be speculation about Fox's intentions, but said Sky's management would not be distracted.""I can't speak for Fox but what I would read into James' acceptance of the role is that he and they continue to be passionate supporters for Sky's ongoing success,"" he told reporters.FORCED OUT  The younger son of the media tycoon, now 43, quit as the chairman of the-then BSkyB in 2012, brought down by his link to the newspaper business which he was running at the time. Having returned to New York, he rebuilt his career at Fox. He will replace Nick Ferguson, who has been chairman of Sky since 2012 and on the board for 12 years, at the end of April.In his absence, Sky lost no momentum in Britain and Ireland, where its product innovation, slate of programming and marketing prowess have countered the threat from new rival BT (BT.L).Operating profit hit 747 million pounds ($1.1 billion) for the six months to end-December, ahead of the 727 million pounds expected by analysts according to a company-supplied consensus. It added 337,000 new customers in the second quarter, with strong growth in both TV and broadband and its highest numbers of new customers in its biggest UK and Ireland market for 10 years.Shares in Sky were trading up 2.5 percent at 1,067 pence at 0933 GMT, valuing the group's equity at 18.35 billion pounds. Jeff Li, co-fund manager of the New Capital fund at EFG Asset Management which is a Sky investor, said shareholders were likely to welcome Murdoch's return.""We think he’s demonstrated enough skill over the years in management, plus the Murdochs have the knack of repeatedly creating value for shareholders to not do anything rash,"" he said. ""As an investor in 21st Century Fox as well, we always consider it a real possibility for Fox to fully take over Sky at some point.""Another investor, Royal London Asset Management, described the appointment as inappropriate. ""Should Fox make a bid for Sky, investors need a strong independent chairman to protect the interests of minority shareholders and negotiate the best possible deal,"" said Ashley Hamilton Claxton, corporate governance manager at RLAM.

Here, ad revenue fell 12 percent, mainly due to weakness in print ads.The company said digital revenue increased and accounted for a third of total ad revenue at Dow Jones.

This particular quarter shows that's still a work in process,"" said Tony Scherrer, director of research at Smead Capital Management, which owns about 3.9 million shares of News Corp. News Corp, which split off from Twenty-First Century Fox Inc in 2013, has been diversifying to rely less on its print business.The company said it expects its fast growing digital real-estate unit, where revenue jumped 35 percent, to become a core pillar of profitability.Revenue in its book publishing business, which includes HarperCollins Publishers, fell 5 percent. The company sold more printed books in the quarter, but not enough to offset the fall in e-book sales, a softness felt by other publishers also, Chief Executive Robert Thomson said on a conference call.The company's total revenue fell 4.3 percent to $2.16 billion in the quarter. Analysts were expecting revenue of $2.13 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue also took a $141 million hit from foreign currency fluctuations, primarily from a weak Australian dollar. In Australia, where Murdoch was born, News Corp's ad revenue declined 26 percent and the company said it was taking steps to streamline costs at newspapers, which includes the Australian and the Sunday Mail.News Corp's net income available to shareholders fell 56 percent to $62 million.

Aine Kerr said in a blog post on Storyful's site that she would leave later this month. She linked her announcement to a separate post from Storyful Chief Executive Rahul Chopra who announced her departure, as well as the appointment of Mandy Jenkins as head of news, and Joe Galvin as director of news.""I leave so excited about the possibilities for journalism, for the role Facebook plays as a source of valuable, newsworthy content, but also as a destination with the largest online audience in the world and advertising revenue models to match,"" Kerr wrote.

207,"  LONDON Feb 20 Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch congratulated a close ally of Prime Minister David Cameron on Saturday for wanting to campaign to leave the European Union in an upcoming referendum.Cameron hailed a landmark deal he said gave Britain ""special status"" in the European Union and pledged to campaign heart and soul to stay in the EU at a referendum expected in June.But he acknowledged that one of his closest political allies, Justice Secretary Michael Gove, would campaign to leave the EU, saying he was disappointed but not surprised. He suggested other Conservatives may also join the ""out"" camp. ""Congratulations Michael Gove,"" Murdoch said on Twitter.   ""Friends always knew his principles would overcome his personal friendships.""The message from the 84-year-old executive chairman of News Corp and 21st Century Fox Inc raises the possibility that some of the media tycoon's British newspapers could campaign for an EU exit. Previous editors of Murdoch's Sun tabloid, the country's biggest selling newspaper, have said they sometimes reflected Murdoch's opinions in the paper on major issues such as which political party to back at elections. Murdoch had previously used the social media network to call Cameron's renegotiation with the EU a ""non-deal"", adding ""Now he's rumoured to be begging cabinet colleagues to put aside beliefs.""Murdoch's News Corp newspapers include the Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and the Sun and the Times in Britain.

208,"   By Malathi Nayak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Verizon Communications Inc, which launched its pay TV plan ""Fios Custom TV"" last year to let viewers choose bundles of channels they want to watch, has redesigned the offering.The revamped Custom TV now offers a choice of one of two packages with over 100 channels and three optional genre-specific packs, instead of a slim offering of 36 channels plus numerous genre-specific add-ons.  The move was not in response to objections from content partners but based on customer feedback, a Verizon spokesman said.  The first package, named ""Essentials,"" has over 190 channels, including the big four U.S. networks - Disney's ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC with no sports offerings. The second package, ""Sports & more,"" has more than 160 channels, including ESPN and regional sports, plus non-sports channels such as the Cartoon Network.In April last year, Verizon repackaged the traditional pay-TV bundle and created a stir with some programmers by moving some traditional pay TV base-tier channels into optional genre-specific add-on packs. The channels it moved included ESPN, a unit of Walt Disney Co and Comcast Corp division NBC Universal's USA. ESPN has sued Verizon, alleging a breach of contract, while Twenty-First Century Fox and NBC Universal have said the Custom TV offering violates their contractual obligations. ESPN is ""encouraged by the changes that Verizon has made to Custom TV,"" spokeswoman Katina Arnold said. She declined to comment on ESPN's lawsuit against Verizon.      FOX and NBC could not be reached immediately for comment. The offering now costs $69.99, along with Fios Internet and digital voice services and three genre-specific add-on packages for $6 each. The first Custom TV iteration started at $65 a month for broadband, 36 fixed basic channels and two genre-based channel packs, from a choice of seven for $10 each.The growing popularity of online video services such as Netflix Inc has put pressure on pay TV providers to innovate.  Last month, Verizon's Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo declined to comment on the ESPN lawsuit on an earnings call with investors, but said customers ""don't want to have to pay for bundles that they never use."" ""We will refresh (Custom TV) here in the short term to be in compliance with the contractual arrangements,"" he added.Compared to pay-TV giants AT&T Inc with its DirecTV acquisition last year and Comcast, Fios has a small market in 12 states and Washington, D.C., with 5.8 million video customers as of the end of 2015.(Corrects to change ""FiOS"" to ""Fios"" in headline and paragraphs 1, 10 and 14.)

209,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Feb 29 News Corp went to trial on Monday in a class action lawsuit that accuses the company of monopolizing the market for in-store promotions at some 52,500 retail stores across the United States.Jury selection got underway in federal court in Manhattan in an antitrust lawsuit filed by consumer packaged goods companies including Dial Corp, Kraft Heinz Foods Co and Smithfield Foods Inc.The lawsuit claims News Corp has monopolized the U.S. market for in-store promotion services, where it acts as a middleman to help companies promote goods through coupon dispensers, electronic signs, end-of-aisle displays and shopping cart ads.The plaintiffs said News Corp, which is controlled by billionaire Rupert Murdoch, has dominated this market since 2004 by locking up exclusive long-term contracts with retailers. By 2009, the plaintiffs said News Corp controlled 90.5 percent of the market. In 2014, its sole remaining competitor, Valassis Communications Inc, abandoned the business, according to court papers.The plaintiffs said News Corp's anti-competitive conduct forced them to pay artificially high prices to promote such goods as Dial soap and Heinz ketchup. It's unclear from court records how much in damages News Corp could face.While the plaintiffs had until recently been seeking damages that could reach $2.5 billion if tripled by a federal judge under U.S. antitrust law, pre-trial rulings have recently limited News Corp's potential liability. News Corp has denied the plaintiffs' allegations, and says it has ""acted lawfully at all times, and caused no harm to competition or the competitive process.""The litigation is part of a long-running battle over News Corp's marketing operations.In January 2010, the New York-based company agreed to pay $500 million to end rival Valassis's antitrust lawsuit over the newspaper coupon market.The case is Dial Corp et al v.

217,"   By Ross Kerber and Jessica Toonkel | BOSTON/NEW YORK  BOSTON/NEW YORK T. Rowe Price Group Inc plans to vote against key directors at companies with two classes of shares in the upcoming U.S. corporate annual meeting season, as the big asset manager steps up its push against companies that give extra voting clout to insiders.Major U.S. corporations from Viacom Inc to Facebook Inc have classes of shares that give founders, CEOs and other insiders extra influence, creating a long-running debate over the balance of power between them and outside investors.The change in policy has not been reported. Portfolio managers can vote counter to the policy, where warranted, the asset manager said.Still, the change at one the largest publicly traded fund firms, with $763 billion in assets under management at the end of last year, sends a message to boardrooms and could boost efforts by activists to equalize voting rights at some established companies.At Viacom, investors are calling for controlling shareholder Sumner Redstone to end a dual-class structure, saying it insulates leaders from investor pressure.Meanwhile, Rupert Murdoch maintains his influence at Twenty-First Century Fox Inc and News Corp thanks to a similar structure, as do the founders of Google parent Alphabet Inc. In all, more than 10 percent of companies in the Russell 3000 Index have unequal voting of shares, according to FactSet. Donna Anderson, head of T. Rowe Price's corporate governance efforts, said the Baltimore-based company adopted the new policy last month after becoming alarmed by the rising number of initial public offerings with dual-class structures, mimicking the larger companies.Proponents of new rules say outside investors should have an equal vote in corporate decisions, while backers of dual-class structures say they help ensure that founders and other trusted leaders can plan for the long term - and that outside investors understand the rules when buying shares.There were no immediate signs that other big fund firms would make a similar change. A spokeswoman for Vanguard Group said it had no plans to change its voting policies to follow T. Rowe Price’s lead. A spokesman for BlackRock Inc declined to comment on the matter and Fidelity Investments did not immediately return a request for comment. T. Rowe Price and other fund firms have backed efforts for change before, but the new policy specifically focuses on directors the company has backed in the past. ""To just endorse their re-election every year sends the wrong message,"" Anderson said in an interview this week. Under the new policy, at dual-class U.S. companies with unequal voting rights, T. Rowe Price funds now will vote against lead independent directors, or independent chairs, and all nominating and corporate governance committee members.  While the new policy may not determine whether directors are re-elected, T. Rowe Price's size means the change will ""make those directors take notice,"" said Laura Campos, director of shareholder activities for the Nathan Cummings Foundation, which has pressed News Corp to end its dual-class structure.Since August, a half-dozen IPOs have included unequal voting rights, according to FactSet, including dating website operator Match Group Inc and digital payments company Square Inc. Shareholder resolutions calling for companies to give all shares an equal vote also have gained ground. At Ford Motor Co such a proposal received 36 percent support in 2015, up from 19 percent support in 2009, according to Manhattan Institute data. On March 14 a vote on a similar advisory proposal will be held at Viacom. The proposal is not expected to pass as Redstone still controls a majority of the media company's voting stock.

244,"   By Paul Sandle | LONDON  LONDON European pay-TV group Sky (SKYB.L) said a twin focus on product innovation and top-class sport and entertainment would help deliver a better-than-expected rise in revenue in the year ahead after it reported 12 percent higher full-year profit.Sky, in which Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) owns 39 percent, has been seeking to earn more money from existing customers through new products and price rises instead of chasing new subscribers with cut-price offers. Rival BT (BT.L), Britain's biggest telecoms group, also updated the market on Thursday, saying demand for broadband boosted its first-quarter earnings, which include a first contribution from mobile operator EE.The two companies have been playing to their strengths -- premium TV content for Sky and broadband for BT -- while selling extra products to existing customers. Sky's shares had their best rise in nearly three years, up as much as 7.3 percent. The stock was trading 2.6 percent higher at 911.5 pence at 1326 GMT, while BT shares were 3.4 percent higher at 416 pence. Analysts at Citi said Sky's results ""should be greeted with relief"" as investors had been worried about the company failing to keep customers or add enough new ones.Churn - the percentage of customers leaving - rose to 11.2 percent in the fourth quarter, at the higher end of analysts' expectations.Sky's Chief Executive Jeremy Darroch said he was ""actually very happy"" with the churn rate, saying it had risen with its growing proportion of broadband-only customers who were more likely to switch suppliers. He also said a number of cut price offers that had boosted subscribers were ending. Analysts at stockbroker AJ Bell, however, said Sky had a customer loyalty problem on its hands.""The broadcaster has historically tried to keep the level below 10 percent, but clearly its recent decision to put up TV prices and limit retention discounts hasn't gone down well,"" they said.BEST CONTENT  The ""Game of Thrones"" broadcaster added 808,000 customers and 3.3 million new products across its operations in Britain and Ireland, Germany and Austria, and Italy in the year.""We are continuing to invest in the areas that really matter for customers, whether that's on screen in the very best content, in new product innovation or in delivering the very best customer service,"" Darroch said.Sky said it expected revenue growth of 5-7 percent, topping market forecasts of 5 percent, in the year to end-June 2017.It also increased expected cost savings from the integration of Sky Deutschland and Sky Italia to 400 million pounds by 2020, from 200 million by 2017, and said it would separately reduce costs by 2-3 percent of sales next year.  The savings, analysts said, would help offset higher costs for Premier League soccer.Sky's revenue rose 7 percent to 11.97 billion pounds, beating forecasts of 11.75 billion, with adjusted operating profit broadly in line with forecasts at 1.56 billion pounds.BT reported earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of 1.82 billion pounds in the three months to the end of June, compared with a company-supplied analyst forecast of 1.78 billion pounds.""This is a good start to the year, I think it's ahead of consensus on all the key metrics,"" said BT's Chief Executive Gavin Patterson.BT, which is in talks with telecoms regulator Ofcom about restructuring to improve national broadband coverage, said in May it expected to produce core earnings of around 7.9 billion pounds for the year.

246,"   By Lisa Richwine  Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) reported better-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday, but higher sports programming and film marketing costs held back gains, and the media company's shares fell more than 4 percent after-hours.Executives also sought to quell concerns over the future of Fox News Channel following the departure of long-time leader Roger Ailes.""Throughout this process, we have moved quickly and decisively to protect the business, protect its employees and protect the unique and important voice Fox News has,"" Co-Executive Chairman Lachlan Murdoch said on a conference call with analysts, addressing Ailes' resignation two weeks ago from the network he built into a powerhouse. Ailes left amid allegations of sexual harassment, which he has denied.Fox News is on track to record its highest-rated year ever, Murdoch said. The network known for its line-up of conservative commentators has been boosted by high interest in the U.S. presidential campaign.Asked if Fox News would change its strategy, Murdoch said: ""There is no desire or need to shift the position it has in the market."" Strong results from Fox News helped lift revenue in the company's cable division for the quarter that ended in June by 9.9 percent, accounting for more than half of the company's total revenue. Domestic advertising sales in the cable business rose 13 percent.But higher costs for sports programming and film marketing  dented profits. Some major film releases fell short of expectations, Chief Executive James Murdoch said. ""It is clear we have work to do at the film studio,"" he said. After an initial spike, shares of the Rupert Murdoch-controlled company dropped more than 4 percent to $25.85 in after-hours trading.

250,"   By Malathi Nayak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Hulu has beefed up its customer service staff and is hiring executives from outside and within the online video business to slow subscriber defections ahead of the introduction of its live TV service, a top official of the streaming company said.""As we think about that offering of live TV, (viewers) are going to be more important to us than they ever have been,"" Ben Smith, a senior vice president and head of experience, said in an interview.Luring and keeping customers is becoming harder as the online streaming market gets more crowded and subscribers, freed from cable television's contract model, can cancel service with a click of the mouse.   The company, which plans to roll out the new live TV bundle of broadcast and cable network channels early next year, has one of the industry's highest customer defection rates at 50 percent, according to research firm Parks Associates. Hulu, which on Wednesday announced the sale of a 10 percent stake to Time Warner Inc, is hiring executives from data-driven companies to better understand who is logging on to watch shows and movies and how they can be converted into long-term subscribers, Smith said. The company has nearly tripled its number of customer service agents to 250 since 2014, Smith said. He personally handles more than 20 subscriber queries every month, he added.Hulu declined to comment on its investment in customer service or the Time Warner agreement. As part of the deal, Time Warner's channels including TBS, Cartoon Network and Turner Classic Movies, will be available on Hulu's upcoming service. Other Hulu owners are Comcast Corp, Walt Disney Co and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. Hulu's 12 million customers currently watch shows such as ""The Mindy Project"" on demand for $8 per month with commercials or $12 without them. A July customer experience study from research firm Forrester said Hulu and Netflix tied for first place among other streaming video services, even ranking higher than cable competitors. Netflix has a 9 percent customer defection rate, according to Parks Associates. Hulu's executive hires include Ehren Schlue from Amazon.com Inc in 2014 and Karen Van Kirk from Intuit Inc this year, Smith said.  ""As we think about adding live and linear TV into Hulu,"" he said, ""we know there's an additional sensitivity that we’ll need to develop both in terms of how we operate Hulu and in how we work with our customers.""

Its shares were up 3.5 percent at $78.40 in afternoon trading.The company, which also owns the Warner Bros movie studio, is paying $583 million for the Hulu stake, executives said on a conference call. Other Hulu owners are Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O), Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O).Time Warner has been trying to woo younger viewers and push into the online video market dominated by services such as Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Amazon Prime (AMZN.O). Last year it introduced its own streaming service, ""HBO Now,"" and made its content accessible on Dish Network Corp's (DISH.O) Sling TV streaming service, which offers a small bundle of channels. ""They want to ensure that the Turner networks have the broadest possible distribution without really compromising the traditional cable, satellite and telco channels,"" said Wunderlich Securities analyst Matthew Harrigan.The investment also gives Hulu additional funding as it prepares to roll out a new live-streaming service, which is slated for early next year. Turner's networks, including TBS, Cartoon Network and Turner Classic Movies, will be available live and on-demand on Hulu's new service, Time Warner Inc said on Wednesday. The company raised its 2016 earnings forecast by 5 cents a share to a range of $5.35 to $5.45. Analysts on average were expecting $5.39, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Second-quarter revenue fell 5.3 percent to $6.95 billion from $7.35 billion, mainly due to a decline for the Warner Bros studio.Revenue from the Turner division rose 6.5 percent during the quarter.

259,"   By Daniel Wiessner and Jessica Toonkel  Fox News will pay $20 million to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit by former anchor Gretchen Carlson, whose allegations led to the resignation of network chief Roger Ailes in July, a source familiar with the agreement said on Tuesday.The company also settled with two other women who were part of a Fox-initiated investigation by the law firm Paul, Weiss, Wharton & Garrison, according to the source, who wished to remain anonymous.The settlements come less than two months after Fox News' parent company, 21st Century Fox, hired Paul, Weiss to investigate claims against Ailes. During that investigation, more than two dozen women described harassment by Ailes, according to New York Magazine. In a move that legal experts said was unusual, 21st Century Fox offered a public apology to Carlson, who filed suit against Ailes in July, saying he took her off a popular show and cut her pay because she refused to have a sexual relationship with him.""We sincerely regret and apologize for the fact that Gretchen was not treated with the respect and dignity that she and all of our colleagues deserve,"" the company said.While the settlement removes some uncertainty, observers said questions remain about the conservative news channel's ability to retain top talent and whether more allegations will surface.Fox News also announced on Tuesday that Greta Van Susteren, host of ""On the Record,"" was leaving the network after 14 years.A court filing showed Carlson, 50, had voluntarily dismissed her federal lawsuit in New Jersey against Ailes. In a statement, she said she was grateful Fox took swift action.The source said Ailes' contract indemnified him from employment-related claims, which was why the company was settling on his behalf. Attorneys for Ailes did not return calls for comment.""INDECENCY AND MISOGYNY"" Fox News still is fighting sexual harassment claims in a New York state court. Former anchor Andrea Tantaros claimed she was taken off the air in April in retaliation for rebuffing Ailes' advances and complaining to top officials at Fox News.Behind the scenes, her lawsuit said, Fox News was ""a sex-fueled, Playboy Mansion-like cult, steeped in intimidation, indecency and misogyny."" Fox News characterized Tantaros as an ""opportunist"" who was taken off the air for writing a book without permission. The speed with which Fox settled with Carlson suggested it may settle with Tantaros, said Dan Eaton, a San Diego State University business ethics lecturer and employment attorney.Ailes, a former political consultant who founded the conservative news operation in 1996, left Fox less than three weeks after Carlson filed suit, taking a $40 million severance package. Tantaros and other women who had worked for him then came forward with more harassment allegations.Ailes had said Carlson's lawsuit was in retaliation for the network's decision not to renew her contract after disappointing ratings for her show.A $20 million settlement is high for a sexual harassment case but not surprising given the high profile of the people involved, said Douglas Wigdor, a New York City employment lawyer who represents employees.""Any settlement is going to take into account how much the (plaintiff) was earning, as well as the notoriety of the person being accused,” said Wigdor, who is not involved in the case.  Fox News, which generated more than $1 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for 21st Century Fox in fiscal 2016, is the most watched channel in basic cable television this year, according to Nielsen ratings data.  QUESTIONS LINGER In his resignation letter, Ailes did not indicate he had done anything wrong. He previously denied Carlson's allegations, as well as those of star anchor Megyn Kelly.New York magazine reported in July that Kelly had told investigators hired by Fox that Ailes ""made unwanted sexual advances toward her"" about 10 years ago.Van Susteren's departure was related to a financial disagreement with her employer, according to a separate source familiar with the situation, who requested anonymity because discussions were confidential. The source declined to say if her departure was connected to Ailes' resignation.Shares of 21st Century Fox fell less than 1 percent Tuesday, versus a slight gain for the broader stock market, and closed at $24.42 on the Nasdaq.

Attorneys for Ailes did not return calls for comment.""INDECENCY AND MISOGYNY"" Fox News still is fighting sexual harassment claims in a New York state court. Former anchor Andrea Tantaros claimed she was taken off the air in April in retaliation for rebuffing Ailes' advances and complaining to top officials at Fox News.Behind the scenes, her lawsuit said, Fox News was ""a sex-fueled, Playboy Mansion-like cult, steeped in intimidation, indecency and misogyny."" Fox News characterized Tantaros as an ""opportunist"" who was taken off the air for writing a book without permission. The speed with which Fox settled with Carlson suggested it may settle with Tantaros, said Dan Eaton, a San Diego State University business ethics lecturer and employment attorney.Ailes, a former political consultant who founded the conservative news operation in 1996, left Fox less than three weeks after Carlson filed suit, taking a $40 million severance package. Tantaros and other women who had worked for him then came forward with more harassment allegations.Ailes had said Carlson's lawsuit was in retaliation for the network's decision not to renew her contract after disappointing ratings for her show.A $20 million settlement is high for a sexual harassment case but not surprising given the high profile of the people involved, said Douglas Wigdor, a New York City employment lawyer who represents employees.""Any settlement is going to take into account how much the (plaintiff) was earning, as well as the notoriety of the person being accused,” said Wigdor, who is not involved in the case.  Fox News, which generated more than $1 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for 21st Century Fox in fiscal 2016, is the most watched channel in basic cable television this year, according to Nielsen ratings data.  QUESTIONS LINGER In his resignation letter, Ailes did not indicate he had done anything wrong. He previously denied Carlson's allegations, as well as those of star anchor Megyn Kelly.New York magazine reported in July that Kelly had told investigators hired by Fox that Ailes ""made unwanted sexual advances toward her"" about 10 years ago.Van Susteren's departure was related to a financial disagreement with her employer, according to a separate source familiar with the situation, who requested anonymity because discussions were confidential. The source declined to say if her departure was connected to Ailes' resignation.Shares of 21st Century Fox fell less than 1 percent Tuesday, versus a slight gain for the broader stock market, and closed at $24.42 on the Nasdaq.

262,"   By David Shepardson | WASHINGTON, Sept 7  WASHINGTON, Sept 7 The top U.S. communications regulator plans on Thursday to unveil a revised plan to allow about 100 million pay TV subscribers to replace expensive set-top boxes with less-costly apps that provide access to television and video programs, two people briefed on the plan said.Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler proposed in January opening the $20 billion cable and satellite TV set-top box market to new competitors and allow consumers to access multiple content providers from a single app or device.The plan, aimed at breaking the cable industry's long grip on the lucrative pay TV market and lowering prices for consumers, drew fierce opposition from TV and content providers, including AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc.The FCC has said Americans spend $20 billion a year to lease pay-TV boxes, or an average of $231 annually. Set-top box rental fees have jumped 185 percent since 1994, while the cost of TVs, computers and mobile phones has dropped 90 percent, the FCC has estimated. The pay TV industry raised concerns over copyright, content licensing and privacy issues and made a counterproposal in June, offering to commit to creating its own apps to allow consumers to watch programs without needing to lease a box.Wheeler's revised plan is expected to include some components of the pay TV industry's proposal, and to exempt some smaller cable providers from the new requirements. The plan is also expected to create a licensing body to oversee the pay-TV apps, according to industry filings with the FCC. The revised application-based proposal is expected to come before the five-member commission for a vote on Sept. 29 at the commission's next meeting, the sources briefed on the matter said.Kim Hart, a spokeswoman for Wheeler, declined to comment. Disney, CBS, Viacom, Time Warner  Inc, Scripps Networks Inc and others met with Wheeler aides last week to discuss ""a revised approach... that would ensure that all of programmers' valuable content would remain inside of, and under the control of, apps developed exclusively by"" cable and other pay-TV providers, according to a filing with the FCC this week.These companies fear that rivals like Alphabet Inc  or Apple Inc could create devices or apps and insert their own content or advertising in cable content.Wheeler's January proposal would create a framework for device manufacturers and software developers to produce a single device or app to gain access to content from providers such as Netflix Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Hulu, Alphabet's YouTube and a pay-TV company.Wheeler has an aggressive agenda in the final months of the Obama administration. He wants the FCC to finalize a proposal to ensure privacy for broadband Internet users by barring providers from collecting user data without consent. He also wants to complete reforms of the $40 billion annual market for business data services known as special access lines.

265,"   By Alan Baldwin | LONDON  LONDON Formula One's commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone has been asked to stay on for three years after an imminent takeover of the sport is completed by U.S. cable TV mogul John Malone's Liberty Media.""They want me to be here for three years,"" the 85-year-old, who over the decades has built the sport into a business with annual turnover of around $1.9 billion, told Reuters on Wednesday.Media reports have suggested the first part of a broader deal between outgoing rights holders CVC and Liberty Media could be announced on Wednesday.However Ecclestone and CVC chairman Donald Mackenzie voiced some scepticism about the time frame at last weekend's Italian Grand Prix.""Honestly, I don't think anybody knows -- including our friends from Liberty, and Donald,"" said Ecclestone, who still  expected the deal to get over the line.The Briton said he would not be attending next week's Singapore Grand Prix, the social highlight of the sport's Asian calendar, because of the negotiations.""Because all this is going through, they (CVC) want me to be there (in London) to help them with all sorts of things. I can't afford to be away for five to six days.""TUESDAY MEETING A Formula One board meeting is scheduled for next Tuesday, by which time the deal should have been finalised and a new chairman introduced. Ecclestone expects that to be Chase Carey, executive vice-chairman of Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox and a director of Sky News owner Sky Plc, who would replace Austrian Peter Brabeck-Letmathe.Brabeck, 71, has been chairman since 2012 but has recently recovered from cancer and is due to step down as chairman of Nestle, the world's largest food and drink company, in 2017.Ecclestone, famously unwilling to delegate in the past, indicated he would be happy to share the workload.""He (Carey) can do lots of things that I haven't done with this social media, which he seems to be in touch with. He's been dealing with sponsorship with his TV people. Between us we'll get on with it,"" he said.Ecclestone's future had been called into question, with former team owner and television pundit Eddie Jordan saying on Sunday that Monza could even be the Briton's last race. ""That's Eddie Jordan. If he had any money, and wanted a small wager, I'd give him good odds,"" said Ecclestone.BIGGEST SHAKE-UP  The takeover, which values Formula One at more than $8 billion according to media reports, would represent the biggest shake-up in the cash-rich sport for decades.A deal with Liberty would also herald a new era for a European-dominated sport that has long sought to break into the U.S. market and win fresh audiences, with team principals already welcoming the possibility of a bigger push. Liberty Media has interests in the Atlanta Braves baseball team, satellite radio service Sirius XM, entertainment group Live Nation and minority interests in Time Warner and Viacom.Malone's Liberty Global is the world's largest international TV and broadband company, operating in more than 30 countries in Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean through a series of different brand names.One bump in the road ahead could be the need for the deal to be approved by the sport's governing International Automobile Federation (FIA) and other global motorsport series, and European anti-trust regulators.The FIA has a one percent stake in Formula One's parent company Delta Topco, which could be worth around $90 million according to forbes.com, and that has been held up as a possible conflict of interest. The privately-owned Force India and Sauber teams have also filed a complaint asking EU authorities to investigate the sport's governance and distribution of revenues.Ecclestone expected the European Commission to take a closer look at the sport as a result.""It's like the police. You get stopped for a rear light and they want to know if you've got a driving license and insurance. So I don't know what effect that will have,"" he said.

269,"   By Alan Baldwin and Toby Sterling | LONDON  LONDON Liberty Media's takeover of Formula One promises a long-term strategy for the cash-rich sport with a sharper focus on new media markets and another attempt to expand in North America.The deal, valued at $8 billion including debt, gives an American media and telecoms business effective control of a sport rather than the more customary situation of such companies paying up to buy rights to screen live events.The deal was seen as positive for a sport featuring famous car brands such as Ferrari and Mercedes, as well as for buyer Liberty Media, owned by U.S. cable TV mogul John Malone.However, changes will take time to feed through given that Formula One Chief Executive Bernie Ecclestone has negotiated lengthy TV contracts that will help to generate estimated revenues of $1.8 billion from 21 grand prix races this season.Ecclestone, who transformed the sport's fortunes over the past four decades and turns 86 next month, will have a new chairman to work with in the shape of Chase Carey. Carey is  executive vice-chairman of Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox and a director of Formula One rights holder Sky .Formula One teams and sponsors have long chafed at the lack of a marketing and digital strategy for the sport, with Ecclestone focusing on generating piles of cash for shareholders through television rights and race hosting fees.""I can't really think of a better buyer,"" said motorsport marketing executive Zak Brown, the chief executive of CSM Sport&Entertainment.""If you had to write down a list of who you would want to buy Formula One, Liberty would be top of that list,"" added the American, whose company is part of Chime Communications and represents many of Formula One's leading sponsors. GEARING UP FOR EXPANSION Brown saw Liberty's arrival as bringing longer-term vision  that could see the sport embark on significant growth in areas such as the United States, and said sponsors were excited by the prospects of attracting a new and younger audience.""They've sold it to strategic buyer as opposed to another financial buyer,"" he said.""So they will be making decisions that are strategic-led, what's best for the growth of the sport and the fans and the sponsors."" Liberty Media has acquired an initial 18.7 percent stake from private equity firm CVC Capital Partners and plans to compete a cash and shares deal by the first quarter of 2017.Malone has built his empire over more than 40 years of dealmaking in the cable and pay-TV industry, earning him the nickname the ""Cable Cowboy"".His Liberty Global is the world's largest international TV and broadband company, operating in more than 30 countries in Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean.Analyst Allan Nichols of Morning Star said the Formula One deal could help to strengthen Malone's American Charter cable business.""He's looking at this as a way to helping distinguish his  Charter in the U.S.,"" Nichols said, adding that Charter might seek to oust NBC as the rights holder with the contract coming up for renewal. Other broadcasters enjoy the security of longer-term deals, with Sky in Britain having the British rights until 2024.Another way to expand revenues would be to develop additional streams for fans in individual countries that focus, for instance, on the race from the point of view of a driver who is a hometown favorite.Adding more races to an already crowded calendar -- this year's 21-race program is a record -- would be another obvious way to enhance revenues if the schedule could accommodate it.Montreal, the Texan city of Austin, and Mexico City are the three current venues in North America but an east and west coast city in the United States would be commercially attractive.Formula One teams will be given the chance to invest in the sport after Liberty Media's takeover and the smaller ones are hoping the new owners will also help them become more competitive on the track.Bob Fernley, deputy principal of the Force India team, hoped that would be the case: ""We have a unique product in Formula One... now we can overlay on that an incredible sports marketing operation,"" he said.

273,"   (Corrects attribution of announcement to Fox News)NEW YORK Fox News said on Wednesday that co-presidents Jack Abernethy and Bill Shine have signed new multiyear contracts, deals that put to rest some uncertainty about the cable channel's direction after the departure of former Chairman Roger Ailes.The two company veterans were named co-presidents in August after Ailes resigned. Former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson sued Ailes in July, claiming sexual harassment. Ailes has denied the charges but Fox News parent 21st Century Fox settled the case on Ailes' behalf for $20 million on Sept. 6.""Jack and Bill have been instrumental in Fox News’ continued dominance in the ratings and historic earnings performance,"" Rupert Murdoch, executive chairman of 21st Century Fox, said in a statement. ""I am delighted they’ve each signed new deals, ensuring stability and leadership to help guide the network for years to come."" Terms of the contracts were not disclosed. The departure of Ailes, who is credited with turning Fox News into a ratings powerhouse, raised questions about the network's ability to keep talent and its wide ratings lead over competitors.Lachlan Murdoch, co-executive chairman of 21st Century Fox and Rupert Murdoch's son, told investors at a Bank of America Merrill Lynch media conference on Wednesday that it would be ""foolish"" to change Fox News' strategy.

299,"  LONDON Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown urged Britain to delay Rupert Murdoch's proposed deal to buy European pay-TV group Sky (SKYB.L) until the government completes an inquiry into a phone hacking scandal, the Guardian said on Wednesday.Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) announced a preliminary deal to buy the rest of Sky it does not already own for $14 billion last Friday, five years after a hacking scandal at one of his tabloid newspapers derailed a previous attempt.  The scandal triggered a year-long public inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the press, led by senior judge Brian Leveson, that interviewed former prime ministers, celebrities and public figures. A second part of the inquiry into specific claims around hacking has not started and the government is consulting the industry on whether it is still in the public interest.Brown said in a statement sent to Reuters that he was calling for the second part of the inquiry to take place but did not mention the bid. ""It is clear that, given these questions (about wrongdoing), the Leveson 2 inquiry should take place in advance of any final decision related to the future of Sky TV,"" the Guardian newspaper quoted Brown as saying in a letter to the government department responsible for media. Murdoch's bid for Sky was pulled in 2011 following public outrage at his now defunct tabloid the News of the World, some of whose staff hacked into phones to break news.  People familiar with the matter have told Reuters that Fox and Sky are working to hammer out the final details and could announce an agreement by the end of this week, possibly as soon as Thursday.Any bid will be examined by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to see whether it damages media plurality in Britain.

300,"  New sexual harassment accusations against former Fox News network chief Roger Ailes were revealed in a lawsuit filed against 21st Century Fox on Monday.The lawsuit comes just months after Fox News agreed to pay $20 million to settle separate allegations of sexual harassment of female staff at Fox News by Ailes.The federal discrimination lawsuit filed in New York alleges that Ailes offered Lidia Curanaj, whose legal name is Lidija Ujkic, an interview to join the Fox News Network after meeting her at a dinner in 2011.After being interviewed in a group setting, Ailes invited her to a private interview, the complaint said. He then told her it was ""important [for female talent] to look good from head to toe,"" and asked her to stand and turn around for him.The suit also alleged that Ailes later contacted a man Curanaj previously dated asking if she would ""put out"" sexually. The man told Ailes she likely would not, the suit said, after which she was turned down for the job. An attorney for Ailes could not be immediately reached to comment on the accusations, though he has consistently denied similar sexual harassment allegations.Curanaj's lawsuit does not name Ailes or Fox News as a defendant, but rather alleges gender, age, race and pregnancy discrimination on the part of her employer, New York Fox TV station WNYW. The suit claims that when Curanaj confronted the station's news director about not being promoted to anchor despite her journalistic experience and successes, he replied she was ""not attractive enough to be an anchor.""A spokeswoman for Fox TV Stations, a subsidiary of 21st Century Fox (FOXA.O), said in an emailed statement, ""We do not think the plaintiff's claims have merit, and we intend to defend vigorously."" Fox News in September agreed to pay $20 million to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by former anchor Gretchen Carlson. A subsequent internal investigation of the company turned up more than two dozen women who described harassment by Ailes, according to New York Magazine.

302,"   By Fiona Maharg-Bravo | MADRID  MADRID (Reuters Breakingviews) - Sky’s shareholders can’t fly much higher. Some of the UK pay-TV group’s investors are grumbling that independent directors gave in too quickly to an opportunistic bid from Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox. But the market had previously given Sky the thumbs-down, and the premium looks generous. A small sweetener is the best investors can hope for.The 85-year-old mogul’s 11 billion pound offer for the 61 percent of the group Fox doesn’t already own looks cannily timed. Before news of the bid was made public, Sky’s shares had lost about 30 percent since the start of the year. In U.S. dollar terms they were 40 percent cheaper. Comparative valuations are tricky because Sky is Britain’s only quoted pay-TV firm, and it competes with telecom operator BT for sports rights. Even so, Sky didn’t look obviously neglected. Judged on a multiple of forward earnings, it was trading at a similar premium to BT and UK broadcaster ITV as in early 2015 – though it had lost some altitude since Britain’s referendum on EU membership in June.It’s also hard to argue that investors lacked a clear picture. Sky had outlined its growth plans at a capital markets day in October. Despite the company’s flashy presentation, the shares continued to slide as investors fretted over the escalating costs of acquiring sports rights and the threat of online TV and movie services like Amazon and Netflix.  The premium also looks generous at 40 percent to the share price on Dec. 6, the last business day before Fox made its offer to Sky’s board. The average UK takeover commanded a 27 percent premium last year, and 35 percent this year so far, according to Thomson Reuters data. Takeovers like Sky where the buyer is also the largest shareholder tend to have smaller markups, due to the lack of competing bidders. Besides, Sky’s independent directors didn’t exactly roll over. They extracted a higher offer from Fox, which had initially proposed a lower price, according to a person familiar with the situation. And there are still issues to be negotiated which could affect the value, including how to share the risk of completion. Sky’s directors might be able to nudge Fox a bit more, but investors expecting a large bump will probably be disappointed.On Twitter twitter.com/Breakingviews",2016-12-15,FOXA,"Thu Dec 15, 2016 | 7:11am EST",Sky shareholders are close to maximum altitude,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-sky-plc-m-a-breakingviews-idUSKBN1441FH?type=companyNews
303,"  LONDON Prime Minister Theresa May did not discuss with Rupert Murdoch the proposed takeover of UK pay-TV group Sky (SKYB.L) by the tycoon's Twenty-First Century Fox at a September meeting, Britain's media minister said on Tuesday.May had met Murdoch during a meeting in New York, three months before Fox launched its approach for Sky earlier in December. ""She (May) had a pre-arranged meeting with Wall Street Journal editors,"" Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport Karen Bradley told parliament in reply to a question from a lawmaker.""Mr Murdoch dropped into that meeting and I can assure him (the questioner) that the proposed takeover was not discussed,"" she added. Murdoch said on Monday he had never asked a British prime minister for anything, seeking to play down his influence ahead of what is likely to be a politically charged approval process for his $14.6 billion bid for Sky. Bradley will have 10 days to decide whether the takeover triggers public interest concerns once she has received formal notification of the deal, which she said had yet to happen.  ""What is important is that, given my quasi-judicial role, I protect the integrity of the process and ensure that as and when, if, a formal notification is given that that is properly considered,"" she said. She also said she had had no prior knowledge that the deal was coming and first read about it in the press.
