The end of a dispute that started on Feb. 2 sent the company's shares up as much as 8 percent to a 52-week high of $49.65 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.The company did not have to pay any monetary damages, just implement reforms, Elizabeth DeBold, a spokeswoman for the Attorney General's office said.GNC was one of four retailers that halted sales of certain supplements after being subpoenaed by Schneiderman as DNA tests failed to detect plant materials that the companies claimed were a part of their supplements. Both internal and independent third-party tests had proved that GNC's ""products are safe, pure, properly labeled and in full compliance with all regulatory requirements"", the company said in a statement on Monday.GNC had said earlier that tests showed its products contained all herbal extracts listed on labels, and on Monday the company said it had restarted selling its Herbal Plus products.A study commissioned by the Attorney General to determine the presence or absence of the DNA of certain plants in some herbal supplements also found GNC's products were within prescribed FDA guidelines, Schneiderman's statement said. GNC will start DNA barcoding within 18 months to confirm the authenticity of all plants used as sources for its herbal supplements prior to processing, Schneiderman said.The company would test for allergen contamination pre and post production and had also agreed to prominently disclose in its stores and on its website if a supplement product was derived from whole herbs or extracts, Schneiderman said.Herbal Plus is part of GNC's vitamins, minerals and herbal supplements business, which accounts for almost 40 percent of its U.S. retail revenue.The investigation into the supplements sold by Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Target Corp was ongoing, DeBold said.Walgreens was reviewing the matter and intends to continue cooperating with the Attorney General's office, spokesperson James Graham said.Wal-Mart and Target were not available for comment.

12,"  June 25 Drugstore operator Rite Aid Corp's  shareholders on Thursday voted to change the terms of payment for its chief executive's golden parachute, supporting a union-backed investor group over the company's board.Rite Aid CEO John Standley stands to receive $42 million if he loses his job in the event of the company being taken over, including $31.6 million through the accelerated vesting of outstanding equity awards.CtW Investment Group, which has a nominal stake in Rite Aid and advises funds holding a 0.18 percent stake, had proposed to limit the accelerated vesting, saying the amount should instead be paid on a pro-rata basis, based on the CEO's performance until a takeover.CtW Investment said it sought to rein in the value of accelerated equity as such payments should not be based on what an executive might have earned if he or she had not only kept the position after a takeover but also met performance targets. According to preliminary results, 58 percent of Rite Aid shareholders voted in favor of the proposal, according to a statement from CtW Investment, which is affiliated with Change to Win, a federation of unions.Rite Aid was not immediately available for comment. There has been speculation that Rite Aid could be an acquisition target. Pharmacy giant Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc  have expressed interest in buying the company in the past.While proxy advisory firms Glass Lewis and ISS supported CtW Investment's proposal, Rite Aid had argued that such a move would potentially undermine its compensation program and ability to retain executives. CtW Investment has asked that if Rite Aid changes its policy, the move should be applicable to both current and future CEO contracts.CtW Investment owned 865 Rite Aid shares, according to a May 15 regulatory filing, and says it works with pension funds that are associated with Change to Win and manage $250 billion in assets.Rite Aid's shares were off 0.5 percent at $8.64 in afternoon trading.

17,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Walgreen Co has reached a $22.4 million settlement with the New York attorney general resolving claims that a unit improperly billed the government for reimbursement for a pediatric drug.The settlement, disclosed in court papers filed in Manhattan federal court on Thursday, resolves claims first asserted in 2009 by a whistleblower in a lawsuit against Trinity Homecare LLC, a pharmacy primarily owned by Walgreen.The settlement marked the second in less than two weeks by the New York attorney general and Walgreen over improper conduct and billings by Trinity, after an earlier $2.55 million accord on June 29.Walgreen agreed to the settlement to avoid delay and expense and did so without any admission of liability, said spokesman James Cohn. The latest settlement concerned an injectable respiratory drug called Synagis, a brand name drug sold by AstraZeneca Plc  that is intended for at-risk premature infants.According to the whistleblower lawsuit filed by a hospital physician, Susan Vierczhalek, Trinity promoted the off-label use of the drug and caused false claims to be submitted to the government.

18,"  NEW YORK Walgreen Co has reached a $22.4 million settlement with the New York attorney general resolving claims that a unit improperly billed the government for reimbursement for a pediatric drug.The settlement, disclosed in court papers filed in Manhattan federal court on Thursday, resolves claims first asserted in 2009 by a whistleblower in a lawsuit against Trinity Homecare LLC, a pharmacy primarily owned by Walgreen.The settlement marked the second in less than two weeks by the New York attorney general and Walgreen over improper conduct and billings by Trinity, after an earlier $2.55 million accord on June 29.Walgreen agreed to the settlement to avoid delay and expense and did so without any admission of liability, said spokesman James Cohn. The latest settlement concerned an injectable respiratory drug called Synagis, a brand name drug sold by AstraZeneca Plc that is intended for at-risk premature infants.

26,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Drugstore chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) said on Tuesday it would acquire smaller peer Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) for $9.4 billion to widen its footprint in the United States and negotiate for lower drug costs.The $9-a-share cash deal, worth $17.2 billion including acquired debt, will increase the footprint of Walgreens, the largest U.S. drugstore chain, by half. It will also improve its ability to negotiate for low drug prices and fend off rivals from Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) to online pharmacies.The price represents a 48 percent premium to where Rite-Aid shares closed on Monday, the day before the agreement was signed, the companies said in a joint release.A Walgreens-Rite Aid deal would need approval from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which studies retail mergers to ensure they comply with antitrust law.Shares of Rite Aid, which had a market value of $6.36 billion at Monday's close, rose as much as 44 percent on Tuesday after the Wall Street Journal first reported the deal talks. Walgreens stock rose as much as 7 percent.Walgreens said it expects the transaction to close in the second half of 2016 and to boost its earnings per share in the first full year after its completion. Moreover, it sees cost savings of more than $1 billion from buying Rite-Aid, which will initially operate under its existing brand name. The healthcare sector has been consolidating in recent years as providers look to beef up and bargain for lower prices from drugmakers. In part, that is because President Barack Obama’s national healthcare reform law seeks to limit spending by cutting payments in government insurance programs. Large companies that provide health benefits have also tightened their spending. 'ROBUSTLY COMPETITIVE' Hospitals, drug distributors, health insurers and companies that manage pharmacy benefits all say that they need to be bigger to compete in this new landscape. Analysts said the deal would increase Walgreens' presence in the Pacific Northwest and make it better able to take on CVS Health Corp (CVS.N), the nation's largest drug chain in terms of sales.CVS, whose shares rose 1.8 percent on Tuesday, in August closed its $10.1 billion acquisition of pharmacy services provider Omnicare, which will expand its presence in the senior care market.  Antitrust lawyer David Balto, a former FTC official, earlier on Tuesday said the Walgreens-Rite-Aid deal would receive careful scrutiny by U.S. regulators and then probably be approved.""Drugstore services have evolved substantially in the past several years,"" he said, ""and the market is becoming robustly competitive, with substantial competition from supermarkets and mass merchants."" Others said that given an extended FTC review of office supplies retailer Staples Inc's (SPLS.O) planned takeover of Office Depot Inc (ODP.O), the Walgreens-Rite Aid deal would also be closely scrutinized.Walgreens has 13,200 stores, some 60 percent of which are in the United States, and generated $76.4 billion in sales in the year ended on Aug. 31, 2014. Rite Aid, with 4,570 U.S. stores, has annual sales of about $27 billion.  CVS had sales of $139.4 billion last year. But it has 7,870 stores, fewer than Walgreens. While Walgreens focuses more on its retail drugstore business, CVS, through its 2007 acquisition of CareMark, is also the second largest pharmacy-benefit manager in the U.S.    Pharmacy benefit managers are paid by health plans to ensure drugstores only dispense medicines on the plan's list of pre-authorized drugs -- a middleman role designed to keep drug costs down.""This would be a merger that's really about increasing scale"" and getting cost savings, said Tigress Financial Partners Research Director Philip Van Deusen.Increased scale would help the combined company better withstand pricing pressure from major retailers, including  Internet players like Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) that sell many of the same products, Deusen said.

32,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan and Diane Bartz  Two influential U.S. senators called for close scrutiny of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc's (WBA.O) plan to buy Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) for $9.4 billion, a deal that would unite two of the three biggest U.S. drugstore chains.Walgreens Chief Executive Stefano Pessina said the company had analyzed the antitrust aspect of the deal but would not speculate on the number of drugstores it might need to divest in order to win regulatory approval.Walgreens ranks first and Rite Aid third by number of stores, either side of CVS Health Corp (CVS.N).The top two antitrust lawmakers in the U.S. Senate on Wednesday urged antitrust enforcers to give the plan careful scrutiny because of the importance of healthcare in the U.S. economy.""I have fought tirelessly to promote competition in the health sector and I believe the proposed merger of two of the three largest drug store chains in the country raises serious issues,"" Senator Amy Klobuchar, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, said in a statement.The subcommittee's chair, Republican Senator Mike Lee, said he hoped antitrust agencies would ""closely scrutinize"" the deal. Several analysts and antitrust lawyers said the deal would probably pass regulatory muster provided some stores were divested, especially in the northeastern United States, where Walgreens and Rite Aid stores overlap by more than 25 percent.Walgreens shares closed down 10.7 percent on Wednesday.

35,"   By Ransdell Pierson, Ramkumar Iyer and Siddharth Cavale  Drugstore chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) said on Tuesday it would acquire smaller peer Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) for $9.4 billion to widen its footprint in the United States and negotiate for lower drug costs.The $9-a-share cash deal, worth $17.2 billion including acquired debt, will increase the footprint of Walgreens, the largest U.S. drugstore chain, by half. It will also improve its ability to negotiate for low drug prices and fend off rivals from Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) to online pharmacies.The price represents a 48 percent premium to where Rite-Aid shares closed on Monday, the day before the agreement was signed, the companies said in a joint release.A Walgreens-Rite Aid deal would need approval from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which studies retail mergers to ensure they comply with antitrust law.Shares of Rite Aid, which had a market value of $6.36 billion at Monday's close, rose as much as 44 percent on Tuesday after the Wall Street Journal first reported the deal talks. Walgreens stock rose as much as 7 percent.Walgreens said it expects the transaction to close in the second half of 2016 and to boost its earnings per share in the first full year after its completion. Moreover, it sees cost savings of more than $1 billion from buying Rite-Aid, which will initially operate under its existing brand name. The healthcare sector has been consolidating in recent years as providers look to beef up and bargain for lower prices from drugmakers. In part, that is because President Barack Obama’s national healthcare reform law seeks to limit spending by cutting payments in government insurance programs. Large companies that provide health benefits have also tightened their spending. 'ROBUSTLY COMPETITIVE' Hospitals, drug distributors, health insurers and companies that manage pharmacy benefits all say that they need to be bigger to compete in this new landscape. Analysts said the deal would increase Walgreens' presence in the Pacific Northwest and make it better able to take on CVS Health Corp (CVS.N), the nation's largest drug chain in terms of sales.CVS, whose shares rose 1.8 percent on Tuesday, in August closed its $10.1 billion acquisition of pharmacy services provider Omnicare, which will expand its presence in the senior care market. Antitrust lawyer David Balto, a former FTC official, earlier on Tuesday said the Walgreens-Rite-Aid deal would receive careful scrutiny by U.S. regulators and then probably be approved. ""Drugstore services have evolved substantially in the past several years,"" he said, ""and the market is becoming robustly competitive, with substantial competition from supermarkets and mass merchants."" Others said that given an extended FTC review of office supplies retailer Staples Inc's (SPLS.O) planned takeover of Office Depot Inc (ODP.O), the Walgreens-Rite Aid deal would also be closely scrutinized.Many analysts expect some divestitures to be required in states where the combined company would have a particularly strong position, including parts of the northeast. In New York, for instance, the two have more than 25 percent of the market by store count, Cowen analysts said. Walgreens has 13,200 stores, some 60 percent of which are in the United States, and generated $76.4 billion in sales in the year ended on Aug. 31, 2014. Rite Aid, with 4,570 U.S. stores, has annual sales of about $27 billion. CVS had sales of $139.4 billion last year. But it has 7,870 stores, fewer than Walgreens.  While Walgreens focuses more on its retail drugstore business, CVS, through its 2007 acquisition of CareMark, is also the second largest pharmacy-benefit manager in the U.S.    Pharmacy benefit managers are paid by health plans to ensure drugstores only dispense medicines on the plan's list of pre-authorized drugs - a middleman role designed to keep drug costs down.""This would be a merger that's really about increasing scale"" and getting cost savings, said Tigress Financial Partners Research Director Philip Van Deusen.Increased scale would help the combined company better withstand pricing pressure from major retailers, including  Internet players like Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) that sell many of the same products, Deusen said.

Reuters reported on Tuesday that a probe by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was focused on the drugmaker's relationship with Philidor RX Services, a specialty drug distributor that came under fire for its aggressive tactics to increase insurer reimbursements.  Valeant has since cut ties with Philador and reached a deal to distribute its drugs through Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O).The company said the delay in releasing the results was related to the return of Chief Executive Michael Pearson two months after he was hospitalized for pneumonia. ""Now that I have returned, I have been working diligently to review the business so that I can share our latest performance and outlook with shareholders,"" Pearson said in a statement on Monday.Valeant said it would hold a conference call after releasing its results. The company said this month it would restate results for 2014 and 2015 after identifying some sales to Philidor that should have been recognized when products were dispensed to patients, not when they were delivered to the distributor.Valeant's Toronto-listed shares were up 8 percent at C$88.15 at midday, while its U.S.-listed shares trading at $66.43.

64,"  Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. is making the opioid antidote naloxone available without a prescription in all its pharmacies in New Mexico, part of a plan to make the drug readily available in 35 states by the end of this year.Naloxone, administered by injection or nasal spray, can be used in the event of an overdose to reverse the effects of heroin and other opioid drugs. The Obama administration has been funding expanded distribution of naloxone amid a growing epidemic of addiction to opioid drugs in the United States.     The drugstore chain has already made naloxone available without a prescription in Alabama, Indiana, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island.In 2014, a record number of Americans died from drug overdoses. New Mexico had one of the highest rates of overdose deaths, along with West Virginia, New Hampshire, Kentucky and Ohio. In March, New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez signed a bill into law that expands access to naloxone, allowing it to be available in more than 70 Walgreens pharmacies throughout the state. The law also protects those who administer naloxone from civil liability and criminal prosecution. ""Walgreens' expansion of medications access in northern New Mexico and throughout the state will make it easier for families to help their loved ones suffering from addiction,"" said Richard Martinez, a Democratic member of the state Senate. Approximately 78 people die in the United States every day due to drug overdose, with half of those deaths related to prescription opioid pain medications, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""We want to make sure that we work together with all the states in accordance with each state’s pharmacy regulations and make this life saving drug available to all,"" a representative of Walgreens said.

69,"   By Amrutha Penumudi and Rod Nickel  Reuters) - Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO) slashed its 2016 forecasts on Tuesday, as its new chief executive said he would focus on rebuilding the reputation of a ""distracted organization"" with a debt-loaded balance sheet.The maker of toenail fungus cream Jublia and anti-depressant drug Wellbutrin, which has faced intense scrutiny for business and accounting practices, missed first-quarter profit estimates on weakness in its dermatology business.The Laval, Quebec-based drugmaker expects full-year adjusted earnings of $6.60-$7.00 per share, compared with its previous forecast of $8.50-$9.50, and revenue of $9.9 billion-$10.1 billion, down from $11.0 billion-$11.2 billion.The Canadian drugmaker's U.S.-listed shares (VRX.N) slumped to close down 14.6 percent to $24.64, paring earlier losses of as much as 22 percent.""Negative external attention continues to adversely impact the business and our reputation with patients, physicians and all of you, our shareholders, as well as our distracted organization,"" Chief Executive Joe Papa, who took over in May, said during a conference call with analysts.He did not directly answer a question on whether there had been takeover offers for Valeant.Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb Inc, one of Valeant's biggest shareholders, cut its stake by more than half to 4.7 percent as of May 31, it said in a regulatory filing. The investment firm that runs the Sequoia Fund, long known for its ties to Warren Buffett, was sued by shareholders who claim it recklessly took a huge stake in Valeant.Papa said the results reflected ""significant disruption"" over the past nine months. It will take up to six months to stabilize the company, he said, including staff recruitment, improving relationships with doctors and drug payers, selling assets and repaying debt.Papa did not specify which assets would be put up for sale, but said they do not include core businesses of dermatology, consumer products, Bausch + Lomb eyecare and Salix gastrointestinal drugs.The company has repaid $730 million of its roughly $30 billion in debt this year, and is aiming for total repayment of $1.7 billion. Valeant racked up much of the debt through its aggressive pace of acquisitions under former CEO Mike Pearson. Papa called Valeant's problems ""speed bumps,"" but doubts remain for others.Valeant has $15 billion in debt due by 2020, and ""if the business stays the way it is, or continues to deteriorate, we believe Valeant will be challenged in making those debt payments,"" wrote Wells Fargo analyst David Maris. During the analysts' call, he questioned executives about a lack of transparency in how the company offered guidance.Up to Monday's close, the stock had fallen nearly 90 percent from its August 2015 high of $263.81.Valeant filed its 2015 financial report in late April, after missing an original deadline of March 15 due to an in-house review of its accounting practices, allaying concerns about a possible default on its debt. The probe found problems dating back to 2014. The company, which will hold its 2016 annual meeting of shareholders on June 14, filed its quarterly report on Tuesday with the U.S. regulators, ahead of a July 31 deadline. Papa said there are still challenges, including with U.S. dermatology sales, which are reliant on a pact with pharmacy Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O). Dermatology sales dropped 43 percent during the first quarter compared with the same period in the previous year.Valeant's net loss was $373.7 million, or $1.08 per share in the first quarter, compared with a profit of $97.7 million, or 28 cents per share, a year earlier.On an adjusted basis, Valeant earned $1.27 per share, missing the average analyst estimate of $1.37, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Total revenue rose 9.3 percent to $2.37 billion, missing the average analyst estimate of $2.38 billion.

91,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, September 01 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB' rating to  Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.'s (WBA) $1 billion unsecured term loan. The loan  is structured in two $500 million tranches, with one maturing in March 2017 and  the other maturing one year following the date of the close of the Rite Aid  Corporation (Rite Aid) acquisition, pending regulatory approval. Proceeds will  be used to partly fund the company's acquisition of Rite Aid. Fitch rates WBA's  Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'BBB'/Stable Outlook.  A full list of  ratings follows at the end of this release. Of the total $17 billion purchase price for Rite Aid, Fitch estimates WBA will  fund the acquisition with $14.6 billion of debt, including the assumption of  $2.3 billion of Rite Aid's existing unsecured debt. As WBA has obtained $6  billion in term loans and $6 billion of unsecured notes, the company will need  to raise another $0.3 billion in financing. WBA has disclosed that this could  include bank financing, commercial paper and/or private debt placement.  The 'BBB' rating incorporates WBA's leading position and increasing market share  in the growing drugstore category. WBA's ample free cash flow (FCF) provides it  the financial flexibility to invest strategically in its business and new  opportunities while managing its balance sheet. The debt-financed Rite Aid  acquisition offers WBA the ability to strengthen its competitive position and  generate significant procurement and cost synergies.  While incremental debt is expected to yield elevated leverage at 4.2x on a pro  forma basis, Fitch expects WBA to return adjusted leverage to its historical  low-3.0x levels by fiscal 2019 (August). Concerns include ongoing pressure on  U.S. pharmacy reimbursement rates, WBA's under-penetration in the U.S. specialty  pharmacy business, and integration risks with Rite Aid. KEY RATING DRIVERS Since Walgreen Co. (WAG) completed its merger with Alliance Boots to form WBA on  Dec. 31, 2014, the combined entity has developed a holistic strategy to grow its  presence in the U.S. healthcare market. The company has undertaken a number of  strategic priorities to drive the business, including the following: --AmerisourceBergen Corp. (ABC) Long-Term Relationship: In March 2013, WAG and  wholesaler ABC announced a 10-year agreement (extension of three years announced  on May 5, 2016) to source all drugs through a newly formed strategic partnership  which would enable sharing of synergies by layering ABC's generic volume into  WBA. Previously, WAG sourced branded pharmaceuticals through Cardinal Health  Inc., specialty pharmaceuticals through ABC and generics directly from  manufacturers.  Management also believed an economic interest in ABC was important and  structured warrants and an open-market purchase program. As of August 2016, WBA  owns 24% of ABC at a cost of approximately $3.1 billion after exercising its  final warrants for $1.2 billion (announced August 25, 2016).  --Rite Aid Purchase: In October 2015, WBA announced the proposed purchase of  Rite Aid, designed to add to the company's national retail coverage and  purchasing scale. Rite Aid - which has approximately 6% share of the U.S.  prescription market - has strong presence in key markets where Walgreens has  lower market share such as California and the Northeast. The company is also  targeting $1 billion in cost synergies, including leveraging scale in sourcing  and eliminating duplicative corporate expenses. Fitch has modelled synergies  approaching $750 million by fiscal 2019. The transaction is expected to close in  the second half of calendar 2016.  --Cost Structure Opportunities: The company has identified $1.5 billion in cost  reduction opportunities primarily in the Walgreens U.S. business (up from $1  billion initially identified in June 2012 at the announcement of the  WAG/Alliance Boots partnership) and plans to complete the program by the end of  fiscal 2017. Key areas of focus have included retail footprint optimization,  headquarters rationalization and store operations efficiencies. In terms of the front-end, which represents around 30% of enterprise sales  volume (three-quarters via Walgreens stores in the U.S.), WBA has a multifaceted  strategy. First, new management sees an opportunity to improve basic operations  such as inventory management and shrink reduction. Second, management believes  Walgreens has historically been overly focused on promotions, with many loss  leaders driving down margins. WBA has been reducing promotions and relying more  on strong operations and its Balance Rewards loyalty program to drive sales.  Third, WBA plans to revitalize its beauty offering in the U.S., using elements  of the successful Boots model including owned brands such as No 7, Soap & Glory  and Botanics. Fitch views as positive efforts to drive installed loyalty  programs as a means to improve customer stickiness.  RATING STRENGTHS Category Growth and Competitive Resilience WBA benefits from share gains in its U.S. pharmacy business (approximately 50%  of total company sales), with the industry expected to grow 1%-2% annually each  in volume and pricing. The industry has benefitted from an aging U.S.  population, enrollment increases due to the Affordable Care Act, and  prescription price increases, particularly for specialty pharmaceuticals.  Unlike many other retail categories, Fitch views pharmacies as having limited  competition from new formats given fixed-price contracts and pharmacist supply  constraints. Mail-order, which emerged as a major threat to retailers over the  past several decades, appears to have peaked, particularly given '90-day at  retail' offers across the industry as well as a number of branded drugs shifting  to over-the-counter. There has been significant pharmacy reimbursement pressure due to shifts to  managed care from cash over the 1990s through mid-2000s and growth in  Medicaid/Medicare over the last few years, and this pressure is expected to  continue over the next few years as payers strive to contain healthcare costs.  Economics of scale are critical to negotiate better pricing on pharmaceutical  purchases to help offset some of the reimbursement pressure. As a result, Fitch  expects WBA will continue to drive U.S. share gains with volume growth in the  2%-3% range while overall industry grows at 1%-2%.  Front-end sales have grown in the low-single digits in recent years, and have  shown resilience to competition from channels including discounters and online.  Fitch believes that WBA's low front-end ticket (less than $10 in most cases),  convenience model, and purchase immediacy have allowed it to effectively compete  against new entrants. Fitch expects WBA's front-end comparable store sales  (comps) to be slightly positive over the next three years. Market Share Gains Expected to Continue With 20% prescription market share, WBA is the second largest player in the U.S.  and has driven market share through execution and scale benefits. As a leading  market player with strong loyalty from a sticky customer base, WBA is a  preferred retail partner and can compete effectively for inclusion in pharmacy  networks with acceptable financial terms. WBA's size also permits cost-effective  pharmaceuticals buying, enhanced by its partnership with wholesaler ABC to  leverage the combined buying scale. As a result of WBA's scale and execution, the company has built a long track  record of growth, including U.S. comparable prescription volume growth of 1.8%  and 3.5% in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015, respectively. This growth reflects  market share gains due to the structural challenges facing the retail pharmacy  space. Industry challenges such as increased concentration of payers (including  the government), mail-order, and narrow networks, have not negatively impacted  Walgreens' volume growth and in Fitch's view, have likely helped it gain share  against smaller operators and independents. However, these challenges have  dampened gross margins and Fitch expects WBA's U.S pharmacy gross margins to  decline 30-40 basis points (bps) annually. Despite overall market strength, WBA is underpenetrated in specialty  pharmaceuticals relative to the market and competitors such as CVS Caremark  (CVS), which has made targeted investments into the specialty category and  benefits from its purchase of pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) and mail-order  operator Caremark in 2006. CVS currently has approximately 25% share of the U.S.  specialty market, which Fitch estimates at more than twice that of Walgreens. As  specialty pharmaceutical growth will dominate overall spending growth over the  rating horizon, WBA is somewhat structurally disadvantaged. The company's  recently announced strategic alliance to combine its specialty pharmacy business  with Prime Therapeutics LLC could improve its growth profile while benefitting  from scale efficiencies. Fitch anticipates WBA can grow its U.S. pharmaceuticals  sales in the 4% range annually, by taking share in non-specialty categories  while maintaining or losing modest share in the specialty category. Fitch expects WBA's international business, approximately 30% of total company  sales, to grow in the low-single-digits annually over the forecast horizon,  driven by 1%-2% comps in international retail and modest growth in the  international wholesale business. International gross margins are expected to be  flattish in the low-20% range, as the dynamics pressuring gross margins in the  U.S. are less prevalent abroad. Rite Aid EBITDA Opportunity Fitch views the proposed purchase of Rite Aid, which reported sales of $31  billion and EBITDA of $1.4 billion in 2015, positively due primarily to the  procurement and cost structure opportunities gained by exploiting the combined  entity's scale. The company's $1 billion cost synergy target is predicated  largely on improved sourcing, in addition to reducing duplicative costs in the  combined entity. Based on visibility into these synergy opportunities, Fitch  believes at least $750 million of synergy savings are possible by fiscal 2019,  though mitigated by around $400 million EBITDA reduction, assuming the FTC  mandates approximately 1,000 store closures due to local market share concerns. Rite Aid would improve WBA's national retail coverage, particularly in Southern  California and Northeastern U.S. markets, positioning it well to compete for  inclusion in narrow and preferred pharmacy networks. At the end of fiscal 2015,  76% of U.S. households operated within a five-mile radius of a Walgreens or  Duane Reade (also owned by WBA) and Fitch anticipates the coverage is likely to  rise to the mid-to-high 80% range at the close of the acquisition. Beyond the synergy benefits, WBA may also benefit from store consolidations over  the next few years, where a Rite Aid or Walgreens store is closed and the  prescription file is transferred to another nearby location. The drugstore  industry has historically driven EBITDA improvements through these  consolidations. Additionally, Rite Aid historically has produced lower per-store  sales productivity than its larger peers given significant lack of investments,  and WBA plans to improve comps through its operating expertise. Fitch has not  incorporated upside from either of these opportunities into its forecast. Size and Scale Enables Financial Flexibility WBA's scale affords significant financial flexibility, allowing the company to  invest in its existing business and capitalize on new opportunities while  reducing leverage post the Rite Aid acquisition, which will add approximately  $14 billion of debt to WBA's existing $14 billion (as of May 31, 2016) yielding  pro forma leverage of approximately 4.2x, up from latest 12 months (LTM)  leverage of 3.2x.  Fitch believes the purchase of Rite Aid (assumed in Fitch's modelling to occur  in early fiscal 2017 if approved by the FTC) and accompanying synergies could  drive EBITDA to close to $12 billion in fiscal 2019 compared to a projected $9  billion expected in fiscal 2016 excluding Rite Aid and $10 billion on a pro  forma WBA/Rite Aid basis.  Fitch expects FCF to be $3.5 billion-$4 billion in fiscal 2016-2017 (after  dividends and one-time cash restructuring/merger expenses but prior to any  potential working capital improvements) but should increase to the $5 billion  range by fiscal 2018, and is expected to be used for debt paydown. Fitch  believes debt paydown could yield adjusted leverage in the mid-3x range at the  end of fiscal 2018 and below 3.5x within 36 months of closing the Rite Aid  acquisition, absent any large-scale acquisitions. Should the Rite Aid acquisition not be consummated, Fitch expects WBA to end  fiscal 2016 with leverage in the low-3.0x range. The company would likely use  FCF to resume share repurchases, absent any other acquisition opportunities.  RATING CONCERNS Gross Margin Pressure Fitch sees continued gross margin pressure on sales of pharmaceuticals in the  U.S. Structural margin pressure has been a consequence of increased penetration  of the government as pharmaceutical payer under the Medicare and Medicaid  programs, ongoing pressure from commercial payers, and a mix shift toward the  90-day at retail offering. This pressure has been somewhat mitigated by the  growth in generic penetration over the last few years, though this penetration  is expected to taper given a lighter calendar of branded expirations.  Projected margins may also be affected by the growth in preferred/narrow  networks, as WBA sacrifices margin for network inclusion to drive volume. Over  the forecast horizon, Fitch expects U.S. pharmacy gross margins to decline  30-40bps annually, while U.S front-end gross margins are expected to remain  relatively flat. Fitch has also assumed modest gross margin pressure in WBA's  international retail pharmacy and wholesale businesses.  Cash Flow Deployment Options/Lack of Financial Targets WBA has shown a willingness to use cash and leverage to grow its business.  Examples include its strategic investment in ABC and its announced merger with  Rite Aid. Management has expressed support of partnerships and the need to  reduce inefficiency in the U.S. healthcare system. This mindset, coupled with  management's lack of publicly stated financial targets, yields some concern that  WBA will prioritize strategic growth over balance sheet management in the medium  term. Front-End Competition from Online Players WBA's enterprise front-end sales have been resilient to strengthened competition  from discounters and online channels. Fitch believes this is due to low average  ticket prices, WBA's convenience model and purchase immediacy. However, online  merchants (Amazon.com, Inc. in particular) continue to improve their business  models and speed of delivery, which could impact WBA's higher-margin front-end  sales in the future. New Management Yields Operational Changes WBA is making a number of changes in operations, including corporate  realignment/headcount reduction, streamlining of store-level operations, systems  overhauls, and front-end merchandising changes in categories like beauty. While  these changes could improve margins while boosting sales, they create operating  risk which could result in poor store execution and inventory mismanagement. Rite Aid Integration Risk Fitch assumes WBA can achieve $750 million of the planned $1 billion in  synergies by fiscal 2019. Fitch expects WBA will enact a number of changes to  Rite Aid operations, including store closures/consolidations, supply  chain/procurement changes, and merchandising updates. Any of these could cause  inventory interruptions and customer dissatisfaction, putting at risk both  synergy forecasts and Rite Aid's ongoing sales trajectory. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Fitch expects 2.5%-3% sales growth at legacy WBA, driven by 4% U.S. pharmacy  and 0%-1% U.S. front-end comps and low-single-digit growth in the company's  international retail and wholesale businesses. Rite Aid pharmacy comps are  expected to be in the 2% range, with slightly positive front-end comps. As a  result, sales growth for the combined entity is projected to be around 2%-3%  after adjusting for an assumed 1,000 Rite Aid closures. --Combined gross margin is expected to remain in the 25% range, as 30-40bps of  annual U.S. pharmacy gross margin pressure is mitigated by Rite Aid synergies.  SG&A growth should be modestly lower than sales growth due to fixed-cost  leverage and Rite Aid synergies. Total Rite Aid synergies are expected to be  $750 million by fiscal 2019. --EBITDA is expected to be $9 billion in fiscal 2016, improving to close to $11  billion in fiscal 2017 due to the Rite Aid acquisition and toward the $12  billion range in fiscal 2019 on core business growth and Rite Aid synergies.  Should the acquisition not close, Fitch would expect standalone WBA EBITDA to  increase toward $10 billion over the next 36 months. --FCF after dividends is projected to be $3.5 billion-$4.0 billion in fiscal  2016-2017, increasing to around $5 billion beginning fiscal 2018 on EBITDA  growth and substantial reduction of one-time integration charges. --FCF is expected to be used to reduce debt to the mid-3.0x range in fiscal 2018  and the low-3.0x range in fiscal 2019, at which point WBA could resume share  repurchases (in addition to those offsetting stock-option exercises). --If the Rite Aid acquisition does not close, FCF is projected to be in the $4  billion range beginning fiscal 2017, and could be used to resume WBA's share  repurchase program while maintaining leverage in the low-3.0x range. RATING SENSITIVITIES A negative rating action could occur given some combination of the following: --Persistently negative front-end comparable store sales or flattish  prescription volume growth, indicating market share erosion; --Unsuccessful execution yielding flattish or modestly declining EBITDA from pro  forma levels, driven by greater-than-expected gross margin declines on worsening  reimbursement rates or weak implementation of the Rite Aid integration or  merchandising/systems initiatives; --A debt-financed transaction or divergence of cash flow to unanticipated  strategic priorities, limiting debt paydown; --Diminished confidence in WBA's ability and willingness to reduce leverage  below 3.5x by fiscal 2019, absent an unforeseen debt-financed acquisition. Given WBA's lack of stated targets with respect to financial leverage, an  upgrade is unlikely due to the risk of a leveraging transaction. However, Fitch  would view positively a public commitment to sustain leverage below 3.0x. LIQUIDITY At May 31, 2016, the company had $6.1 billion in liquidity, consisting of $3.1  billion in cash (which excludes $174 million of deposits restricted under agency  agreements and by law and other obligations) and full availability on its $3  billion revolver. WBA had $13.5 billion of debt at May 31, 2016, composed of a GBP billion term  loan ($2.1 billion U.S. dollar equivalent) with the remainder in senior  unsecured notes. WBA is funding the acquisition with $14.6 billion of debt,  including the assumption of $2.3 billion of Rite Aid's existing unsecured debt.

99,"   By Dena Aubin  Pharmacy giant Walgreens Boots Alliance must face claims that it misled shareholders about a sharp spike in generic drug prices in 2013, a federal judge in Chicago has ruled. In a decision on Friday, U.S. District Judge Sharon Coleman said investors had adequately alleged Walgreens falsely portrayed weaker profits during that period as routine, downplaying the drug price increase and unfavorable contracts it had for reimbursements from insurance companies.

110,"   By Diane Bartz and Olivia Oran | WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  WASHINGTON/NEW YORK U.S. corporate dealmakers were likely to put major merger plans on hold as they assess whether U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will follow through on his populist promises and a threat to block AT&T Inc's (T.N) purchase of Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), or act more like traditional business-friendly Republican administrations.Trump's rhetoric and the personal nature of the campaign, which included little discussion of policy, left many uncertain about the new U.S. leader's plans, including how his administration will handle mega-mergers.Wall Street braced for a drop in deals, with Goldman Sachs on Wednesday projecting a 20 to 30 percent downside for earnings of banks that focus on merger and acquisition advice, and Jefferies saying that uncertainty about Trump's policy on trade, healthcare, taxes and energy could hamper underwriting activity and M&A globally.""I think a lot of deals will hit the pause button for a bit until we get some clarity on whether President Trump will moderate or be as disruptive as some expect,"" said a senior Wall Street banker who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak with the media.""It's going to be a tough environment for everything until we see how [Trump] behaves as a leader,"" the banker added.Trump said in October that AT&T's proposed $85 billion acquisition of the owner of HBO, CNN and the Warner Bros film studio was an example of a ""power structure"" rigged against him and voters, and that he would block a deal.The gap between Time Warner shares and the implied value of AT&T’s cash and stock bid was over 23 percent in afternoon trading on Wednesday, compared to around 22 percent at Tuesday's close, indicating greater investor skepticism that the companies will be able to complete the transaction.  Still, some investors believed the man who considers himself business friendly would take a more moderate tone than in the campaign once he assumes office, as he did on Tuesday night in his acceptance speech.""We think Trump will be pretty good for merger and acquisition activity. As a general proposition, he is pro-business and pro-free market,"" said Roy Behren, portfolio manager at Westchester Capital Management.Other big pending U.S. deals also did not see sharp changes in their spreads on Wednesday morning, and the spreads of three pharmaceutical or health care-related deals that have encountered antitrust troubles, Aetna (AET.N)-Humana (HUM.N), Anthem (ANTM.N)-Cigna (CI.N) and Walgreens (WBA.O)-Rite Aid (RAD.N), actually narrowed, signaling investors may think they are more likely to close under a Trump administration. The president does not directly decide if a merger is illegal under antitrust law and the job is done by the U.S. Justice Department or Federal Trade Commission, which divide up the work of assessing mergers. If one of the agencies decides to stop a deal, it must convince a judge to agree.AT&T Chief Financial Officer John Stephens on Wednesday said his company was looking forward to working with Trump and  ""optimistic"" regulators would approve the deal. Trump's policies and discussions ""about infrastructure investment, economic development, and American innovation all fit right in with AT&T's goals,"" Stephens said at the Wells Fargo technology, media and telecoms conference in New York.Time Warner's shares were last down 1 percent to $86.71, after trading as low as $85.60, while AT&T shares were up just under 1 percent at $37.24. The Dow and S&P 500 were both over 1 percent higher in late afternoon trading. The election results mean ""increased risks"" for the AT&T-Time Warner deal, Angelo Zino, analyst at CFRA Research, said.""At the very least, there are going to be individuals put in place (by a Trump administration) that are going to make the deal a lot more challenging to complete,"" he added.   Trump's protectionist stance also raises the risk that some foreign corporations, including from China, may face higher hurdles in trying to take over American companies, dealmakers said.""If you were thinking about doing a cross-border deal six months ago you weren't considering things like potential trade barriers, protectionism and tariffs. These are things you have to at least develop a view on and factor into the risk assessment of doing an overseas deal now,"" said Johs Worsoe, MUFG’s head of investment banking & markets in the Americas.
