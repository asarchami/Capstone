0,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 22 (Fitch) Zions Bancorporation (ZION) recently indicated that  as a result of the issuance of an interim final rule (IFR) published by  regulatory agencies last week, a majority of ZIONâ€™s trust preferred securities  (TruPS) collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) will remain permissible holdings  under the final Volcker Rule, according to Fitch Ratings. ZION had initially indicated it expected to take a $629 million charge, which  was pro forma for Dec. 15 balances, but using Sept. 30 securities valuations.  However, despite the issuance of the IFR which would permit ZION to hold  substantially all of its CDO securities, ZION has now decided to sell certain of  its CDOs, which will result in an impairment charge of between $135 million and  $145 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 (4Qâ€™13), and will contribute to  ZIONâ€™s earnings loss in 4Qâ€™13. Fitch views the sale of some of ZIONâ€™s CDO portfolio as a positive. In Fitchâ€™s  opinion, this may allow the company to cancel its total return swap with  Deustche Bank, which had given the company relief on its risk-weighted assets  calculation in regulatory capital ratios. This could save the company a  significant expense in its quarterly earnings. However, Fitch also notes that the presence of these TruPS CDOâ€™s has  significantly absorbed managementâ€™s attention at the parent level over the last  few years, which could have otherwise been focused on driving the business  forward. Furthermore, the CDOs have caused charges in each of the last two  years, though likely at a much lower level than had ZION sold the securities in  the 2009 - 2011 time period. Given ZIONâ€™s long and short-term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of â€˜BBB-/F3â€™,  which is likely near the lower end of ZIONâ€™s ratings range, Fitch does not see  an impact on the companyâ€™s ratings given the charge noted above. However, given  that the CDOs and related charges continue to weigh on already challenging  earnings, ZIONâ€™s Positive Rating Outlook may come under pressure when Fitch next  reviews the companyâ€™s ratings later in 2014.

1,"   By Emily Stephenson | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. big banks have enough capital buffers to withstand a drastic economic downturn, the Federal Reserve said on Thursday, announcing that 29 out of 30 major banks met the minimum hurdle in its annual health check.All of the big banks except for Zions Bancorp (ZION.O) stayed above the 5 percent requirement for top-tier capital in the latest round of stress tests.The tests aim to show how banks would weather a financial collapse similar to the 2007-2009 crisis. Banks had to show how they would cope with a halving of the stock market, and the eight largest banks had to weigh the impact of the default of their biggest trading counterparty.""While capital is certainly better than it has been in past years, these firms certainly are subject to drops in capital and earnings when subject to severe stress,"" said John Corston, a director in Deloitte's regulatory group.Several firms appeared to disagree with the Fed's scores. Bank of America (BAC.N) and Wells Fargo (WFC.N) released the results of internal stress tests that showed them performing better than they did under the regulators' tests.Stress tests are closely watched by financial markets as a sign of the industry's health, and also because the Fed can reject banks' plans to return capital to shareholders if they think the banks are not strong enough to carry them out.European regulators plan to conduct their own stress tests later this year, following a broad review of the asset quality of banks on the continent.The Fed will announce on March 26 which banks' plans to pay dividends or buy back shares were approved. CAPITAL PLAN SPECULATION For the results released on Thursday, the Fed assumed banks would keep dividends at their current levels and buy back no shares. This release sets off several days of speculation about whether banks with relatively low capital ratios will be allowed to increase dividends.""The only results that are more nerve racking than stress test results for bankers are their bonus results,"" said Dan Ryan, head of PricewaterhouseCoopers's financial services advisory practice.""Although almost every bank came above the capital floor in today's results, we think two to four won't be able to satisfy the Federal Reserve next week that their planned capital actions are appropriate,"" he said. Zions was the only bank to miss the minimum, with a tier 1 capital ratio of 3.5 percent in the most severe stress scenario. A spokesman for Zions was not immediately available for comment.Zions said last month that it expected to resubmit its capital plan due to the sale of some securities that contributed to losses under the toughest stress scenario.The other 29 banks stayed above the minimum levels. But M&T Bank (MTB.N) came in relatively low, at 5.9 percent, and Bank of America's (BAC.N) tier 1 ratio was 6 percent.Bank of America, however, released its own stress tests that showed its capital ratio at a much higher 8.6 percent. A spokesman for the bank declined to comment. Wells Fargo also released internal test results that were higher than the marks it received from the Fed.Bank of New York Mellon (BK.N), Discover Financial Services (DFS.N) and State Street (STT.N) had the highest capital ratios. Discover announced shortly after the release on Thursday that it planned to increase its quarterly dividend.Capital ratios are not always clear indicators of whether the Fed will approve a bank's capital plan. Last year, regulators directed JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) to redo their proposals due to concerns about their capital planning processes.The group of 30 banks' aggregate tier 1 common capital ratio dipped to 7.6 percent under the toughest stress scenario. That ratio was 5.5 percent at the beginning of 2009, the Fed said.This was the first year that Zions and 11 other banks, among which were Comerica (CMA.N) and Discover, participated in the full stress test regime.The other 18 banks, among which were JPMorgan, Citigroup (C.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), participated in previous rounds.

3,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 24 (Fitch) Zions Bancorporation (ZION) recently failed the  Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests (DFAST) conducted by the Federal Reserve. In the  severely adverse stress test scenario, ZION's ending Tier 1 common equity ratio  was 3.6%, well below the 5.0% threshold for passing the test set by regulators.  ZION plans to submit a new capital plan soon that will include actions including  reduction of risk or increases in capital that brings the company's overall  ratios inline or higher than stress test minimums. Fitch does not believe that ZION's ratings, currently 'BBB-/F3' will be impacted  by this development, but it is possible that the Rating Outlook could be revised  to Stable from Positive largely predicated on management's response to this  development. The DFAST stress tests in particular for ZIONs forecasted $2.5 billion of loan  losses, with the largest component being $1.5bn of losses on ZION's large  commercial real estate (CRE) portfolio. Additionally the stress test showed  relatively flat pre-provision net revenue (PPNR), which provided less of a  cushion to absorb the loan losses noted above. Lastly, the increase in  risk-weighted assets (RWA) also increased the denominator in the Tier 1 capital  ratio calculation. Fitch would expect ZION's new capital plan and actions to provide sufficient  cushion to at minimum absorb the above assumptions. Fitch believes it is also  possible that any efforts by ZION to return capital to shareholders may be  delayed by another year as a result of this development.

6,"   By Amanda Becker and Timothy Gardner | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Republicans plan to put approval of the long-delayed Keystone XL oil pipeline on a fast track early next year if they win a U.S. Senate majority in November, finally forcing President Barack Obama to make a tough call on the controversial plan.The $10 billion Keystone project to connect Canadian oil sands with U.S. refineries will top the list of Republican energy priorities if they gain control of the Senate after the November 4 midterm elections. It could come as a stand-alone measure or attached to must-pass legislation such as a government spending or transportation bill, according to senators and congressional aides.Republicans, along with some Democrats, have for years pushed for a bill that would allow Congress to approve Keystone, and reduce the role of the administration. However, with Democrats in control, the closest they have gotten in the Senate was a symbolic measure expressing support for the project.Even so, Republican lawmakers say they have enough votes to pass Keystone - all they need is a new Senate leader who will allow them to vote on a proposal, since Democrat Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada has declined to do so.That could happen if Republicans in November gain six net seats, including several in conservative states now held by Democrats, to secure a majority in the 100-member Senate. They are all but certain to retain control of the U.S. House of Representatives.While the president can veto any bill that does not earn two-thirds support from the House and Senate, Republican Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, a member of the Senate Energy Committee, says Keystone's popularity with a majority of American voters and organized labor, a key Obama constituency, will force his hand.""If we put it on his desk, the broad support nationally for the Keystone pipeline, as well as the pressure he will get from the unions, will provide significant pressure on the president,"" Barrasso told Reuters.TransCanada's pipeline, first proposed six years ago, is a rallying point for environmental groups opposed to increasing production of oil sands crude, which they say is high in emissions linked to climate change. They have urged Obama to reject the company's application at the State Department to build the 1,180 mile (1,900-km) cross-border line. The administration has delayed making a decision.Energy industry executives say stopping the pipeline will not slow Canadian crude from reaching the world market and will prolong U.S. reliance on imports from less stable suppliers. As stand-alone legislation, it would force Obama to either approve or reject the long-stalled plan. Attached to a must-pass but unrelated bill, it would put Obama in the uncomfortable position of either vetoing important legislation or accepting a congressional measure.It is not uncommon for the U.S. Congress to pass legislation that contains unrelated provisions. Such measures have a better chance of being included in unrelated bills if they are broadly popular or have the backing of House and Senate leaders.Republican Senator John Hoeven, an Energy Committee member from North Dakota, said that were at least 57 votes for Keystone now and he expected to have more after the mid-terms. ""We'll be able to pick the vehicle, and we'll have the 60 votes. We'll just attach it and pass it,"" Hoeven, who has sponsored several Keystone bills, told Reuters.   SIX YEARS AND COUNTING So far, past Senate action on the pipeline has consisted of successful Energy Committee votes, attempts to attach approval to a now-dead energy efficiency proposal and symbolic measures.The Senate in March voted 62-37 in favor of a non-binding Keystone proposal attached to a budget resolution, giving hope to pipeline backers that bipartisan support would be strong for an actual approval of the project.In June, Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu, the current head of the energy panel, passed a bill out of the committee to approve the pipeline by a 12-10 vote, but Reid never brought it before the full Senate for a vote. More than 60 percent of the public and nearly half of Democrats support the pipeline, according to a March Pew Research Center poll. The Laborer's International Union of North America and the leader of the AFL-CIO, the largest U.S. labor federation, both support it, saying it would create union jobs.Keystone makes a good goal for Republicans since - even with a slim majority - it would be difficult for them to undo other key Obama energy and environmental initiatives, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's plan to curb carbon pollution from power plants. A path to Keystone could be rocky, though. Obama has said he will only approve a plan that does not significantly exacerbate climate change. And it is unclear whether he would risk his environmental legacy by signing a Keystone bill or opt to veto and wait for the State Department to make a recommendation on the project.Spearheading any effort to force the president's hand would be the presumed leader of a Republican-controlled Senate, current Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, from coal-producing Kentucky. Energy policy would also probably be shepherded by Lisa Murkowski from oil and gas-rich Alaska, who is expected to lead the Senate Energy Committee if Republicans take control. Her agenda would start with areas where there is bipartisan support since ""whatever the Senate passes has to pass both the House and the President's desk,"" spokesman Robert Dillon said.McConnell, who is locked in a tight re-election race, has pledged, if he becomes leader, to eliminate procedural hurdles that have prevented the Senate from debating and voting on bills.""If we have a new majority next year ... the Keystone pipeline will be voted on,"" McConnell told reporters recently.

8,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 07 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Zions Bancorporation's  (Zions) Issuer-Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'BBB-/F3'. The Rating Outlook has been  revised to Stable from Positive.  The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One Finance Corporation (COF),  Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares  Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB), PNC Financial Services  Group (PNC), Regions Financial Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI), US  Bancorp (USB), UnionBanCal Corporation (UBC), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC), and  Zions Bancorporation (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs, VIABILITY RATINGS (VR) & SENIOR DEBT The affirmation of Zions' ratings is reflective of a good franchise largely  spanning many western U.S. states and Texas as well as continued improvements in  asset quality metrics. However, Fitch continues to note that Zions' ratings  remain at the lower end of their potential range for reasons discussed below. Fitch has revised the Rating Outlook for Zions' ratings to Stable from Positive.  The Outlook revision is largely due to continued underperformance relative to  peer banks. Additionally, Fitch believes Zions' difficulty managing the Federal Reserve's  CCAR process last year relative to other banks who navigated it more  successfully also helps to support the Outlook revision to Stable. In the wake of this, Zions re-submitted its capital plan to the Federal Reserve  and received approval for the re-submitted plan in late July 2014. The company  then raised $525 million of common equity.  While Fitch notes that the equity raise helps to provide a cushion to creditors  for unexpected loss, it is also somewhat necessary given the company's  comparatively concentrated loan portfolio by both product and geography.  As previously noted, Zions' earnings profile remains below many banks in its  large regional peer group, and is a key factor keeping the rating at the lower  end of its potential range. Fitch believes some of the earnings lag is due to Zions' running a higher cost  decentralized operating model than peers as well as growing regulatory expenses  and less of a benefit from scale due to Zions' comparatively smaller asset size.  Fitch would also note the earnings lag is in part due to an abundance of  liquidity impacting the company's net interest margin (NIM). While Fitch does not expect much of a change or benefit in the first two  components of the earnings lag, Fitch does note that Zions' balance sheet is  very asset sensitive and positioned for rising rates, particularly in an up 300  basis point scenario. That said, Fitch would also note that this interest rate positioning is  comparatively more aggressive than some peer banks, particularly given Zions'  significant commercial deposit base. On balance, Fitch believes that banks with  more commercial deposits may be more sensitive to deposit repricing pressures in  a rising rate scenario than banks that are more consumer deposit funded  institutions.  Helping to support Zions' ratings is continued improvements in the company's  asset quality metrics alongside the rest of the banking industry. That said,  Fitch believes that asset quality metrics for Zions -- as well as the rest of  the industry -- are nearing or at a cyclical trough, and Fitch would expect some  reversion in asset quality metrics over a medium-to-intermediate term time  horizon. The expectation for this reversion is already incorporated in Zions'  current ratings. RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRs, VRs AND SENIOR DEBT As previously noted, Zions ratings are at the lower end of their potential  rating range given the many challenges the company has endured over the last few  years. With the Rating Outlook revision to Stable from Positive, Fitch is indicating  that Zions' ratings are well situated over a near-to-intermediate term time  horizon. Over a longer-term time horizon, should the company's risk management processes  and procedures continue to season, and should its earnings performance approach  peer averages all while holding capital ratios at least constant (including the  recent equity raise), there could be some very modest upwards rating momentum. While Fitch does not see much downward rating pressure to Zions' ratings, should  the company's asset quality metrics deteriorate at a rate that is faster than  peer averages over a medium-to-long-term time horizon, or should the company  have additional governance and/or risk management issues, there could be  pressure on the Rating Outlook. KEY RATING DRIVERS - HOLDING COMPANY   Zions' IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and banks,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also  equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and  subsidiary default probabilities.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - HOLDING COMPANY Should Zions' holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies.  Fitch is now considering introducing a rating differential between the holding  company and bank in the U.S. due to structural changes in the sector and the  evolving regulatory landscape, as described in the special report 'U.S. Bank  HoldCos & OpCos: Evolving Risk Profiles', dated March 27, 2014. Given Fitch's  views that Zion may not receive a long-term debt requirement, its ratings may  not be impacted as a result of Fitch's evolving review regarding notching. KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  Zions has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, Zions is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of  support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  Zions Support Rating and Support Rating Floor are sensitive to Fitch's  assumption around capacity to procure extraordinary support in case of need.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by Zions and by various  issuing vehicles are all notched down from Zions' or its bank subsidiaries' VRs  in accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective  non-performance and relative loss severity risk profiles.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings of subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by Zions and  its subsidiaries are primarily sensitive to any change in Zions' VR.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY The IDRs and VRs for Zions bank subsidiaries benefit from the cross-guarantee  mechanism in the U.S. under FIRREA, and therefore the IDRs and VRs of Zions'  main bank subsidiaries are equalized across the group.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY  As the IDRs and VRs of the subsidiaries are equalized with those of Zions to  reflect support from their ultimate parent, they are sensitive to changes in the  parent's propensity to provide support, which Fitch currently does not expect,  or from changes in Zions' IDRs.  To the extent that one of Zions' subsidiary or affiliated companies is not  considered to be a core business, Fitch could also notch the subsidiary's rating  from Zions' IDR. KEY RATING DRIVERS - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS Zions uninsured deposit ratings are rated one notch higher than the company's  IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from  depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default.  KEY RATING SENSITIVITIES - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The ratings of long- and short-term deposits issued by Zions and its  subsidiaries are primarily sensitive to any change in Zions long- and short-term  IDRs.  Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Zions Bancorporation --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB-'; --Short-term IDR at 'F3'; --Viability at 'bbb-'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'BBB-'; --Subordinated debt at 'BB+';  --Short-term debt at 'F3'; --Preferred stock at 'B'; --Support at '5';  --Support Floor at 'NF'.

(SNI), is the largest private stakeholder in the local economy of the North African kingdom.Net profit attributable to shareholders fell to 3.56 billion dirhams ($362 million) from 6.18 billion dirhams in 2013, according to its financial statement published in the pro-palace newspaper Le Matin. Consolidated turnover fell 18.6 percent to 33.88 billion dirhams while assets fell slightly to 100.3 billion dirhams.In 2013, SNI sold its stakes in dairy firm Centrale Laitiere  to French partner Danone, and the remaining 50 percent holding in Moroccan biscuit maker Bimo to Kraft Foods. It also sold the sole operator in Morocco's sugar industry Cosumar . Last month it said it hired Goldman Sachs and Rothschild to advise it on the sale of a minority stake in AttijariWafa Bank as it plans to focus its future growth strategy on sectors such as tourism, telecoms and energy.SNI is the main shareholder in some of the country's biggest firms, including AttijariWafa Bank, miner Managem , energy firm Nareva, cement company Lafarge Maroc  and Marjane, Morocco's main supermarket chain. Since the merger with another royal holding firm, ONA, in 2010, SNI has not released how big a stake Siger, the firm that groups the main business interests of the Moroccan royal family, is holding.

11,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Zions Bancorporation's  (ZION) ratings at 'BBB-/F3'. The Rating Outlook remains Stable.  The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One Finance Corporation (COF),  Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares  Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holding  Corporation (MUAH), PNC Financial Services Group (PNC), Regions Financial  Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI), US Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo &  Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRs, VRs, AND SENIOR DEBT Today's affirmation reflects ZION's solid franchise in the Western United States  and maintenance of adequate capital in light of stress-testing and expected  asset quality pressure from the prolonged period of low energy prices. ZION's  rating remains lower than peers and toward the lower end of its long-term rating  potential due to the company's continued weak earnings performance.  The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that earnings challenges will  persist in the near-to-intermediate term relative to peer banks. Moreover, the  Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that asset quality issues related to  the energy sector should be manageable. Fitch views ZION's tepid current and expected earnings performance as a primary  rating driver and a rating constraint. Even when stripping out one-time expense  items such as realized losses on the sale of the company's collateralized debt  obligations (CDOs) over recent quarters as well as debt-extinguishment costs,  performance is relatively weak. Fitch notes that the median ROA for the large  regional peer group through second quarter 2015 (2Q15) was 1.06% compared to  ZION's of 38 basis points (bps). Stripping out one-time costs, Fitch estimates  ZION's return on asset (ROA) at just under 70bps, still well-below peers. In late 2Q15, management announced a major strategic initiative in order to  address the company's relative earnings underperformance. The plan includes  actions such as consolidating its seven bank charters into one, consolidating  risk and other back-office functions and creating a position with the  organizational chart to lead ZION's efforts in growing and diversifying its  level of noninterest income. Fitch generally views this strategic initiative favorably given some of the  efficiencies that should be gained as well as the potential impact that  additional fee income could have on ZION's operating results. Still, Fitch notes  that the plan is still in its early stages and has not been fully executed upon  yet. Therefore, rating actions will be predicated on evidence of successful  execution on this and future strategic initiatives.  Fitch views capital levels as adequate in light of the company's current rating,  balance sheet composition and earnings performance. After quantitatively failing  the Fed's CCAR process in 2014, ZION passed this year's annual stress test,  albeit by just 10bps. ZION's Tier 1 Common capital ratio of 5.1% was the lowest  result in this year's stress test and over 200bps lower than the peer median  under the severely adverse scenario. Fitch also notes that ZION had the largest  decline in its Tier 1 Common capital ratios in both the 2014 and 2015 stress  tests. The divestiture of the company's remaining CDO book should be a net positive for  stress testing going forward given how the investments were treated from a loss  content and risk-weighting perspective. Still, Fitch views this year's and last  year's results as indicative of the company's balance sheet risk as well as its  weak earnings performance which is unable to augment capital levels as much  under a stress scenario compared to higher rated peers. ZION's asset quality remains good and has shown continued improvement  year-over-year. However, Fitch notes that credit quality will likely be  pressured over the near to intermediate term due to the company's exposure to  the energy sector. Loans energy-related companies make up around 7% of total  loans, the second highest level in the large regional peer group. The book has  performed relatively well thus far and the shared national credit exam did not  sure to an outsized provision to the allowance or significant downgrades.  Nevertheless, Fitch expects credit quality deterioration to percolate going  forward as energy prices remain depressed and borrower cash flows are stressed.  This expectation is incorporated into today's rating action. Moreover, Fitch expects deterioration in ZION's commercial real estate  (specifically, loans collateralized by office buildings) and multifamily  portfolios given the secondary and tertiary economic impact to some of the  company's core operating markets in Texas and the Southwest. However, Fitch  expects ZION to reasonably control credit losses on the whole and for the impact  on earnings and capital to be manageable. This expectation is supported by what  Fitch views as solid underwriting of energy credits evidenced by fairly nominal  credit losses during previous energy cycles. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES ZION's subordinated debt is notched one level below its VR of 'bbb-' for loss  severity. ZION's preferred stock is notched five levels below its VR, two times  for loss severity and three times for non-performance, while ZION's trust  preferred securities are notched four times from the VR (two times from the VR  for loss severity and two times for non-performance). These ratings are in  accordance with Fitch's criteria and assessment of the instruments  non-performance and loss severity risk profiles and have thus been affirmed due  to the affirmation of the VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The uninsured deposit ratings of ZION are rated one notch higher than ZION's IDR  and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from depositor  preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities superior  recovery prospects in the event of default.  HOLDING COMPANY  ZION's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and banks,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also  equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and  subsidiary failure and default probabilities.  SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY The IDRs and VRs of ZION's bank subsidiaries are equalized with ZION's IDR  reflecting Fitch's view that they benefit from the cross-guarantee mechanism in  the U.S. under FIRREA. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR ZIION has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, ZION is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of  support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support.   RATING SENSITIVITIES  VR, IDRs, AND SENIOR DEBT As noted above, Fitch believes ZION's ratings are at the lower end of their  potential range. Over the intermediate to longer term horizon, modest positive  rating momentum would likely be driven by a convergence of earnings performance  with higher rated peers while maintaining strong capital levels and adequate  risk controls. Specifically, to the extent that Fitch observes the strategic  initiatives mentioned above gaining traction and resulting in positive operating  leverage while capital is managed conservatively and regulatory hurdles such as  stress-testing are passed both quantitatively and qualitatively, positive rating  action could ensue. Fitch does not expect so see downward rating pressure on ZION in the near term.  However, if asset quality deterioration is outsized relative to peer banks,  measured by percentage increases in nonperforming loans or net charge-offs,  pressure could be placed on ZION's rating or outlook. Moreover, should the  company have governance and/or risk management issues such as a failed CCAR  result on a quantitative or qualitative basis, Fitch would likely take negative  rating action. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings for ZION and its operating companies' subordinated debt and  preferred stock are sensitive to any change to ZION's VR.   LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The long-and short-term deposit ratings are sensitive to any change to ZION's  long-and short-term IDR.  HOLDING COMPANY  Should ZION's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY  As the IDRs and VRs of the subsidiaries are equalized with those of ZION to  reflect support from their ultimate parent, they are sensitive to changes in the  parent's propensity to provide support, which Fitch currently does not expect,  or from changes in ZION's IDRs.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Since ZION's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively,  there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable  future.  The rating actions are as follows:  Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Zions Bancorporation --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB-'; --Short-term IDR at 'F3'; --Viability at 'bbb-'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'BBB-'; --Subordinated debt at 'BB+';  --Short-term debt at 'F3'; --Preferred stock at 'B'; --Support at '5';  --Support Floor at 'NF'.

25,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Zions Bancorporation's  (ZION) ratings at 'BBB-/F3'. The Rating Outlook has been revised to Positive  from Stable. The Positive Outlook reflects Fitch's observation that management has begun  making notable progress in addressing the company's strategic objectives which  is expected to lead to persistently improved core earnings over the rating time  horizon. Fitch believes this progress has been made while not increasing risk  appetite. Moreover, the Outlook revision reflects Fitch's expectation that asset  quality issues related to the energy sector should continue to be manageable.  The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One Finance Corporation (COF),  Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares  Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holding  Corporation (MUAH), PNC Financial Services Group (PNC), Regions Financial  Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI), US Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo &  Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation (ZION). Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly. KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRS, VR AND SENIOR DEBT Today's rating affirmation reflects ZION's sustained, solid franchise in the  Western United States, its strong liquidity and funding profile and maintenance  of adequate capital. ZION's rating remains lower than its peers' and toward the  lower end of its long-term rating potential due to the company's continued weak  earnings performance and, relatively limited company profile. In early 2Q15, management announced a major strategic initiative in order to  address the company's relative earnings underperformance. The plan included  costs saving actions such as consolidating its seven bank charters into one and  consolidating risk and other back-office functions. Moreover, the plan called  for both growing and diversifying its level of noninterest income with the  creation of a position with ZION's organizational structure. Management  communicated that it would be using the company's large levels of cash and  gradually investing in securities in order to stabilize and grow interest  revenue. Although the plan has been in place just over one year, ZION's core financial  performance is improving and is expected to continue to improve such that an  Outlook Positive is warranted. The bank is tracking on its expense and revenue  goals through execution on simplifying its operating structure and focusing on  revenue generating business lines. ZION's adjusted efficiency ratio (which takes  out debt extinguishment costs, gains and losses from sales of investments, etc.)  has improved from 71.5% through 2Q15 to 66.5% through 2Q16. Fitch would expect  this level to come down further throughout 2016 and into 2017 as additional  efficiencies are found and revenue is bolstered by modest loan growth,  additional securities purchases and potentially another rate hike. As expected, ZION's credit quality has been pressured over recent periods due to  its exposure to the energy sector. Energy-related credits made up around 6% of  total loans at 2Q16, one of the highest levels in the large regional peer group.  Moreover, loans to oil field service companies which have experienced larger  loss rates through this cycle, make up over a quarter of the energy-related  book, an outsized level relative to peers. Depressed oil and gas prices have  pushed energy-related nonaccruals to 11% of the energy book at 2Q16, up from  2.3% a year prior. Over the last five quarters, net charge offs (NCOs) within  the portfolio have averaged 3.5%. Still, Fitch recognizes that ZION, like its peer banks with notable energy  exposure, has been able to adequately control credit losses on the whole and the  impact on earnings and capital has been manageable. Excluding energy, NCOs  during the last five quarters has a median of only one basis point annualized.  Moreover, while the total volume of nonperforming assets (inclusive of accruing  troubled debt restructured ) have increased 46.8% year-over-year,  non-energy-related NPAs have continued their steady descent, falling 14.5%  during the same time period. ZION's total level of NPAs was 1.7% of loans and  other real estate owned at 2Q16, a lower level than many higher rated peers.  Fitch's expectation that overall credit costs and NPAs will remain manageable is  incorporated into today's affirmation as well as the Outlook revision. Fitch views capital levels as adequate in light of the company's current rating,  balance sheet composition and earnings performance. ZION had the second highest  CET1 ratio at 2Q16 within the peer group. The company once again passed this  year's annual regulatory stress test on both quantitative and qualitative  grounds. Still, Fitch views stress testing results as indicative of the  company's on balance sheet risk as well as its weak earnings performance and  earnings profile. Capital erosion under the severe adverse scenario has been the  highest of all larger regional peers for three years straight. In Fitch's view,  these results point to the need of having higher than average capital going  forward. This expectation is incorporated into today's rating action. ZION continues to have a strong liquidity and funding profile which supports its  rating. At 2Q16, its loan-to-deposit ratio stood at 85%, well below the peer  median. It also has one of the lowest levels of wholesale funding dependence and  highest levels of noninterest bearing deposits to total deposits relative to  peers, both credit positives. This funding profile has resulted in deposit costs  historically below peer averages and is the result of ZION's strong commercial  and small business banking franchise within its core markets.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  ZION has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, ZION is not systemically important, and therefore the probability of  support is unlikely. Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) and Viability Ratings (VRs)  do not incorporate any support.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES ZION's subordinated debt is notched one level below its VR of 'bbb-' for loss  severity. ZION's preferred stock is notched five levels below its VR, two times  for loss severity and three times for non-performance, while ZION's trust  preferred securities are notched four times from the VR (two times from the VR  for loss severity and two times for non-performance). These ratings are in  accordance with Fitch's criteria and assessment of the instrument's  non-performance and loss severity risk profiles and have thus been affirmed due  to the affirmation of the VR. LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS ZION's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one notch higher than its IDR and  senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from depositor  preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities superior  recovery prospects in the event of default. HOLDING COMPANY  ZION's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and banks,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also  equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and  subsidiary failure and default probabilities. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, VRs AND SENIOR DEBT Fitch has revised its Rating Outlook for ZION to Positive from Stable,  indicating the likelihood of a rating upgrade in the next 12 to 24 months.  Fitch believes ZION's ratings are at the lower end of their potential range  given its capital and liquidity levels and solid franchise. Fitch expects ZION's  core earnings power to remain relatively weak compared to higher rated peers in  the near term. As Fitch observes strategic initiatives continuing to take hold  resulting in earnings performance and an earnings profile consistently in line  with those banks in higher rating categories, positive rating action would be  likely. Although unexpected, to the extent that earnings remain depressed and  Fitch foresees little uplift over the long term, ZION's Outlook could be revised  to Stable from Positive.  Embedded within the Positive Outlook is Fitch's expectation that capital will be  managed appropriately. Rating or Outlook pressure could result if ZION were to  manage capital more aggressively in payout levels or through growth. Should the  company have governance and/or risk management issues or a failed CCAR result on  a quantitative basis, Fitch would likely take negative rating action, although  this is not expected. Also incorporated within today's Outlook revision is the expectation that ZION's  energy exposure will continue to have nominal impact on the bank's earnings and  capital. Fitch expects some additional deterioration in ZION's energy-related  loan portfolio. However, if asset quality deterioration within the book is  outsized relative to peer banks, measured by percentage increases in  nonperforming loans or net charge-offs, pressure could be placed on ZION's  rating or Outlook. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  Since ZION's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively,  there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable  future. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings for ZION and its operating companies' subordinated debt and  preferred stock are sensitive to any change to ZION's VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The long- and short-term deposit ratings are sensitive to any change to ZION's  long- and short-term IDR.  HOLDING COMPANY  Should ZION's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there Fitch could potentially notch the holding  company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Zions Bancorporation --IDR at 'BBB-'; Outlook Positive; --Short-term IDR at 'F3'; --Viability Rating at 'bbb-'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'BBB-'; --Subordinated debt at 'BB+';  --Short-term debt at 'F3'; --Preferred stock at 'B'; --Support Rating at '5';  --Support Floor at 'NF'.
