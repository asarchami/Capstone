0,"  By Louise EganOTTAWA Jan 3 Canada has reached an agreement with United Technologies Corp's Sikorsky Aircraft unit to reactivate a C$5 billion ($4.7 billion) deal to buy 28 helicopters that had been beset by delays and was almost scrapped by Ottawa.Canada signed a contract in 2004 for Sikorsky's Cyclone helicopters to replace its ageing fleet of Sea Kings. But after delays and complications, Ottawa announced last September that it might scrap the deal and consider other options.The Conservative government now says it has accepted the recommendations of a third-party report for a different project model and governance structure.It reached an agreement with Sikorsky on Dec. 31, which will form the basis for formal contract negotiations. Sikorsky also agreed to pay Canada $88.6 million in liquidated damages for non-delivery. ""Under the new terms established in the Principles of Agreement, Sikorsky has committed to deliver the needed helicopter capability at no additional cost to Canada,"" Diane Finley, Canada's minister of public works and government services, said in a statement.""In addition, the Government of Canada will only issue further payment to Sikorsky upon capability delivery,"" she said.Canada will see delivery of helicopters with enough capability to allow the government to begin retiring its old helicopters in 2015. Sikorsky will enhance those capabilities to produce ""fully capable"" CH 148 Cyclone helicopters in 2018. Byron Callan, analyst with Capital Alpha Securities, said the deal was not material for a company the size of United Technologies, but it would allow Sikorsky to move past an issue that had been a source of concern.""It's a Christmas present come late,"" Callan said. ""It allows them a clean slate to start the new year."" Sikorsky officials welcomed the deal.""We are very pleased to have reached this agreement with the Crown and look forward to a contract amendment while we continue to move the program forward,"" said spokesman Paul Jackson.Sikorsky has so far provided just a handful of Cyclones for training purposes, and said last year that some of the delays were caused by major modifications requested by Canada.On Friday, the company apologized for the delays but said it was confident the new plan would succeed.""As the pre-eminent helicopter manufacturer in the world, we regret that we have not executed this program to the satisfaction of the Government of Canada and that no aircraft were delivered in 2013,"" said Sikorsky President Mick Maurer.",2014-01-03,UTX,"Fri Jan 3, 2014 | 5:50pm EST",UPDATE 2-Canada says back on track to buy Sikorsky helicopters,http://www.reuters.com//article/canada-helicopters-idUSL2N0KD1K720140103?type=companyNews
1,"  By Nick Carey and Kim PalmerCHICAGO/CLEVELAND, Ohio Jan 6 A blast of Arctic air gripped the vast middle of the United States on Monday, bringing the coldest temperatures felt in two decades, causing at least four deaths, forcing businesses and schools to close and canceling thousands of flights.Shelters for the homeless were overflowing and the weather threatened to briefly curtail some oil production in the severe cold described by some meteorologists as the ""polar vortex"" and dubbed by media as the ""polar pig.""Temperatures were 20 to 40 degrees F (11-22 degrees C) below average in parts of Montana, North and South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and Nebraska, according to the National Weather Service.More than half the flights at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport were closed as fuel supplies froze, leaving crews unable to fill aircraft tanks. The afternoon temperature in Chicago was minus 12 Degrees Fahrenheit (minus 24 degrees C), making it colder than in areas of Antarctica, parts of which hovered around 32 F (0 C) during the southern hemisphere summer.The Arctic air was moving toward the east coast where temperatures were expected to fall throughout Monday as low as  0 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 18 degrees Celsius) in some areas on Tuesday. The coldest temperatures in years and gusty winds were expected as far south as Brownsville, Texas and central Florida, the National Weather Service said.The northeast saw unseasonably mild weather and rain, but authorities warned travelers to expect icy roads and sidewalks on Tuesday.At least four weather-related deaths were reported. In northwest Missouri, a one-year-old boy died Monday when the vehicle he was riding in crashed into a snow plow on an icy highway, according to the Missouri State Highway Patrol.In Indianapolis, firefighters found the body of an elderly woman outside her home early on Monday.""It appeared she had been there for a while,"" said Captain Michael Pruitt of the Wayne Township Fire Department. A 58-year-old man died on Sunday in northeastern Oklahoma after he lost control of his car on icy roads, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol said. In Chicago, a 48-year-old man died of a heart attack while shoveling snow on Sunday night.In oil fields from Texas to North Dakota and Canada, the severe cold threatened to disrupt traffic, strand wells and interrupt drilling and fracking operations.It also disrupted grain and livestock shipments throughout the farm belt, curbed meat production at several packing plants and threatened to damage the dormant wheat crop.LIFE-THREATENING WIND CHILLS  In Cleveland, Ohio, where the temperature was minus 3 degrees F (minus 19 degrees C) and was forecast to drop to minus 6 degrees F (minus 21 degrees C) overnight, homeless shelters were operating at full capacity. Shelter operators had begun to open overflow facilities to accommodate more than 2,000 people who had come seeking warmth.""There are also going to be people that won't go into the shelters,"" said Brian Davis, an organizer with Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless. Frostbite can set in within minutes in such low temperatures, according to experts.The National Weather Service issued warnings for life-threatening wind chills in western and central North Dakota, with temperatures as low as minus 60 F (minus 51 C).The U.S. cold snap mirrored or outdid freezing weather in parts of the world as Almaty, Kazakhstan where it was minus 8 degrees F (minus 22 C), Mongolia, where temperatures reached minus 10 degrees F (minus 23 C) and Irkutsk, in Siberia, where it was minus 27 degrees F (minus 33 C).

7,"  By Lewis KrauskopfJan 22 United Technologies Corp, the world's largest maker of elevators and air conditioners, reported a rise in fourth-quarter profit that topped estimates, helped by a delay in shipping a helicopter order.The diversified manufacturer said it did not ship eight helicopters under a Canadian contract, as expected, which actually benefited its profit because they are sold at a loss, helping the profit top estimates. However, revenue was reduced by about $400 million because the helicopters were not delivered.Costs for the maritime helicopters have increased under the contract with the Canadian government, to the point that each is now expected to cost the company's Sikorsky unit more to make than the price covers. The company expects to deliver the helicopters later this year.Total revenue at United Technologies, which also produces Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Black Hawk helicopters, rose 1.9 percent to $16.76 billion, it said on Wednesday. That was about $330 million short of analysts' expectations.United Technologies shares rose 1 percent to $116.12 in morning trading. The stock, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, jumped about 37 percent in 2013, outpacing the broader U.S. market. In an interview, United Technologies Chief Executive Officer Louis Chenevert pointed to revenue growth of 4 percent, excluding acquisitions and even with the delayed helicopter shipment.""The combination of organic growth and our sustained cost reduction has us well-positioned for another good year,"" Chenevert said.United Technologies backed its 2014 financial targets, which the company set last month.The company had improved its 2013 earnings outlook in recent quarters, as cost cuts offset weaker revenue than it expected at the start of the year. Earnings from continuing operations soared 53 percent to $1.45 billion, or $1.58 per share. That topped the average analyst estimate of $1.53 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The delay in the Canadian helicopter order boosted earnings by 6 cents per share compared with expectations, the company said.On a net basis, income fell 29 percent to $1.46 billion due to a big year-earlier gain from the sale of several industrial businesses. Operating profit rose across all five of business segments.The company gave other encouraging signs for its aerospace businesses. Orders for Pratt & Whitney engine spare replacement parts rose 20 percent, while such orders increased 19 percent for the aerospace segment that makes other plane components.""It's nice to see the aftermarket activity picking up,"" said Peter Arment, an analyst at Sterne Agee. ""That's good momentum.""Brian Langenberg, an analyst with independent research firm Langenberg & Co, pointed to strong performance in the segment that includes climate control products. Profit margins in that segment rose to 14.8 percent in the quarter from 11.1 percent a year earlier.Langenberg also cited an 8 percent increase in orders at its Otis elevators division.To take advantage of growth in cities in emerging markets, United Technologies last year reorganized its elevator and climate segments under one business.",2014-01-22,UTX,"Wed Jan 22, 2014 | 11:38am EST",UPDATE 3-United Technologies profit tops estimates; revenues miss,http://www.reuters.com//article/unitedtechnologies-results-idUSL2N0KW0HL20140122?type=companyNews

15,"  ISTANBUL Turkey signed a deal worth $3.5 billion on Friday to buy helicopters from United Technologies Corp's (UTX.N) Sikorsky Aircraft unit, finalizing an order originally agreed upon in 2011, said the prime minister.The agreement includes options that analysts say could result in billions of dollars of additional orders over the next three decades.The 109 helicopters will be assembled in Turkey and a version of Sikorsky's popular Black Hawk. The main contractor is Turkish Aerospace Industries with components to be supplied by Sikorsky, Aselsan (ASELS.IS) and other Turkish companies.Sikorsky said the deal marked the start of an important partnership with Turkish industry.""Turkey is such an important market in terms of being a large customer, and it is also strategically important in terms of who they are in the world,"" Sikorsky President Mick Maurer said in a telephone interview. He said the agreement would allow Turkish industry to develop the capability to produce nearly every part of the helicopter, including a newly designed Turkish cockpit.Maurer declined to give many details about the new agreement, but said it would give his company a second source for many of the helicopter's components. He said Sikorsky had already agreed with Turkey to market the Turkish version of the Black Hawk in other markets, helping Sikorsky benefit from Turkey's existing relationships in those areas and generating additional orders for Turkish suppliers.""We're going out arm in arm, as we bring in other sales outside of Turkey that will be supplied by the new supply chain,"" Maurer said.

Todd Harrison, a defense analyst with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, said money included in the war-funding budget in 2014 largely offset the more than $30 billion in across-the-board cuts imposed on the base budget.The budget calls for the Army to shrink to between 440,000 and 450,000 soldiers, down from a war-time high of 570,000, a reduction of 40,000 to 50,000 compared to last year's proposal.It would eliminate the entire fleet of popular A-10 ""Warthog"" tank-killer aircraft, as well as the venerable U-2 reconnaissance plane. The budget also cancels several other key weapons programs. The Army's new ground combat vehicle would be eliminated, saving $3.4 billion over the next five years, and the Army communications network being built by General Dynamics Corp would be scaled back, saving another $3.4 billion.The budget also scraps plans to build two additional Lockheed Martin Corp Advanced Extremely High Frequency satellites, for $2.1 billion in savings, and defers two Global Positioning System III satellites to be built by Lockheed.The Air Force's proposed new combat rescue helicopter, a program for which Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp. was the sole bidder, would be delayed.

25,"  * Lufthansa follows rivals such as BA, United* To be fitted first on 747-8, then other long-haul planes* Aims to steal customers from rivalsBy Victoria BryanBERLIN, March 5 Lufthansa, Germany's largest airline, unveiled its new premium economy class on Wednesday, part of a 3 billion euro investment in seats to catch up with fast-growing rivals from the Middle East.The airline said the new class would first be available on long-haul flights from November on its Boeing 747-8, flying to destinations such as Washington DC, Los Angeles or Hong Kong.Lufthansa is following around 40 other airlines that already have a premium economy class such as British Airways, United or Qantas. The premium economy concept has been around for more than a decade. Lufthansa Passenger Airlines Chief Commercial Officer Jens Bischof said the airline had had sleepless nights about whether to introduce a premium economy class but was comfortable now the group had upgraded its business class, meaning there was enough of a difference between economy and business to justify the introduction of a premium economy.He said he believed the product was of a high enough quality that the airline would be able to snatch customers from rivals.A return flight in premium economy, which give customers more luggage allowance, more space and bigger entertainment screens among other benefits, will cost on average 600 euros more than a regular economy ticket, but far less the average 2,000 euro mark-up for a business class seat, Bischof said. ""The biggest question is whether businesses will now book the class for those travelling on business,"" airline consultant Gerald Wissel from Airbourne told Reuters.Bischof said around 70 percent of business travellers were travelling in economy these days.""We believe the upsale potential for economy to premium economy is far bigger than the downsell from a full-class business with a flat seat,"" he told a packed crowd at the ITB travel fair in Berlin. Bischof said the airline was investing 3 billion euros in improving its product for customers, not counting the 36 billion euros worth of new aircraft it has ordered.He put the investment in the premium economy at 170 million euros, compared with 1 billion for the business class refurbishment.Davy analyst Stephen Furlong said it was important for Lufthansa to invest in its product, even as it cut costs.""They want to be the first European five-star airline. Like a lot of German companies in other industries, they will never be the lowest on costs, so you'd better have a better product than anyone else,"" Furlong said, referring to Lufthansa's attempts to get a five-star rating from Skytrax, which reviews and ranks airlines. Airlines with five-star ratings include Singapore and Cathay, among others.Lufthansa said premium economy would make up around 10 percent of seat capacity on its long-haul flights, carrying around 1.5 million passengers a year in the class. It will be fitted on all 106 of its long-haul planes within a year.Bischof added the group had no plans at present to introduce it on short- or medium-haul, or on other airlines within the Lufthansa group, such as Austrian Airlines.",2014-03-05,UTX,"Wed Mar 5, 2014 | 7:19am EST",UPDATE 1-Lufthansa unveils new premium economy class,http://www.reuters.com//article/lufthansa-premiumeconomy-idUSL6N0M21PJ20140305?type=companyNews

39,"  WASHINGTON, March 27 The U.S. Navy's plan to cancel an order for 29 MH-60 Sikorsky helicopters under a current five-year agreement would trigger termination fees of at least $250 million and raise the cost of Army helicopters covered by the same contract, a top U.S. senator said Thursday.Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, criticized the Navy's plan to ""break"" the multi-year purchase agreement during a hearing on the Navy and Marine Corps budget requests.""This action would result in the government having to pay termination charges of at least $250 million but get nothing in return,"" he said.The cut in MH-60 helicopters is one of a number of controversial proposals sent by the Navy and other U.S. military services to U.S. lawmakers, who have the ultimate control over the Pentagon budget. Navy officials said deep budget cuts agreed by Congress had forced them to make difficult choices across various portfolios in shaping the fiscal 2015 budget.Levin dismissed the Navy's claim that scrapping the fiscal 2016 order of helicopters was related to the planned retirement of the USS George Washington aircraft carrier, noting that each carrier had only five MH-60 helicopters on board. The Navy had no immediate comment on the amount of the projected termination fee. Such fees are generally negotiated between the government and industry.One Navy official said the fiscal 2015 budget included the advanced procurement funding needed to maintain the multi-year contract for now. The reductions planned in fiscal 2016 were linked to the potential cut of an aircraft carrier and coastal combat ships, said the official. Sikorsky, a unit of United Technologies Corp, signed an $8.5 billion contract with the Army and Navy in July 2012 to buy 653 Black Hawk and Seahawk helicopters through December 2017, a deal that generated significant discounts given the larger order quantities.By reneging on the agreement, the Navy was jeopardizing those savings, Levin said. One industry source familiar with the issue said it was rare for the military to break a multi-year contract because they resulted in savings of 10 percent or more, and violating such agreements generated costly termination fees.One congressional aide, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said lawmakers were considering measures to prevent the Navy from cutting the funding in its fiscal 2016 budget.Jim McAleese, a Virginia-based defense consultant, said the Navy had cut funding for the MH-60 and other aircraft programs to preserve money for higher priority shipbuilding programs.(Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell)",2014-03-28,UTX,"Thu Mar 27, 2014 | 8:34pm EDT",US Navy's Sikorsky helicopters cancellation would cost government $250 mln - Levin,http://www.reuters.com//article/unitedtechnologies-helicopters-idUSL1N0MP00T20140328?type=companyNews
40,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Pratt & Whitney, the engine-making unit of United Technologies Corp, must redouble efforts to lower the cost of the single F135 engine it builds for the Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 fighter jet, a top U.S. military official said on Monday.Rear Admiral Randy Mahr, deputy director of the Pentagon's $392 billion F-35 program, said Pratt had slowed its cost-cutting after Congress in 2011 canceled an alternate engine being developed by General Electric Co.""We have reinvigorated the 'war on cost' that Pratt started and then kind of slowed down on when they got the monopoly,"" Mahr told industry executives and military officials at an annual conference hosted by the Navy League.""In no uncertain terms, they've been informed they need to continue to drive the cost down on that engine,"" Mahr told reporters after his remarks at the conference.The comments revealed continuing friction between the program office that runs the Pentagon's costliest weapons program and Pratt at a time when the F-35 program chief, Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan has talked about improved relations with Lockheed, the prime contractor that builds the airplane. In 2012, Bogdan described relations between Lockheed, Pratt and the government as the worst he had seen in two decades of working on acquisition programs.Pratt said it had invested $60 million in ""a very aggressive"" cost-cutting program that had already lowered the cost of the F135 engine by 40 percent.""We are pursuing cost reductions in every aspect of the program, including supply chain, configuration changes, process improvements, and overhead,"" said Pratt spokesman Matthew Bates. He said procurement delays affected costs. Mahr said the government was close to reaching agreement with Pratt on a seventh batch of engines for the new warplane that is being developed for the U.S. military and its allies, but declined to comment on the exact timing of a deal.Bates said the company hoped to wrap up the negotiations by the end of the second quarter.The Pentagon finalized a contract worth $1.1 billion for 38 engines in a sixth batch last October, which pushed the cost of the common configuration engine built for the Air Force and Navy models down by 2.5 percent. It did not provide the exact cost. Mahr said lawyers from the Pentagon's F-35 office were also in talks with Pratt to publicly release details on the cost of the engine, which the government buys separately from the jet.Pratt argues it should not be required to disclose details about the costs of the engine or spare parts, since that could affect the company's ability to compete in a next-generation engine procurement that the Pentagon is kick-starting with a new $1 billion technology demonstration program.Bates said other companies that built sole source military engines had successfully argued against releasing pricing data for such competition reasons in the past.Mahr said the overall F-35 program is making steady progress, although he said some technical issues still needed to be to resolved, including improving the performance of a complex computer-based logistics system called ALIS, and a recent crack in a fan blade on a Pratt engine. The Pentagon was also pressing the industry to lower the cost of building and operating the new jet, and making it more reliable, he said.(Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Grant McCool)",2014-04-07,UTX,"Mon Apr 7, 2014 | 6:45pm EDT",Pratt must push harder to cut F-35 engine cost: Pentagon,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-unitedtechnologies-fighter-engine-idUSBREA361K320140407?type=companyNews

42,"  WASHINGTON, April 7 Pratt & Whitney, the engine-making unit of United Technologies Corp, must redouble efforts to lower the cost of the single F135 engine it builds for the Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 fighter jet, top U.S. military official said on Monday.Rear Admiral Randy Mahr, deputy director of the Pentagon's $392 billion F-35 program, said Pratt had slowed its cost-cutting after Congress in 2011 canceled an alternate engine being developed by General Electric Co.""We have reinvigorated the 'war on cost' that Pratt started and then kind of slowed down on when they got the monopoly,"" Mahr told industry executives and military officials at an annual conference hosted by the Navy League.""In no uncertain terms, they've been informed they need to continue to drive the cost down on that engine,"" Mahr told reporters after his remarks at the conference.The comments revealed continued friction between the program office that runs the Pentagon's costliest weapons program and Pratt at a time when Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan, the F-35 program chief, has talked about improved relations with Lockheed, the prime contractor that builds the airplane. In 2012, Bogdan described relations between Lockheed, Pratt and the government as the worst he had seen in two decades of working on acquisition programs.Mahr said the government was close to reaching agreement with Pratt on a seventh batch of engines for the new warplane that is being developed for the U.S. military and its allies, but declined to comment on the exact timing of a deal. The Pentagon finalized a contract worth $1.1 billion for 38 engines in a sixth batch last October, which pushed the cost of the common configuration engine built for the Air Force and Navy models down by 2.5 percent. It did not provide the exact cost.At the time, Chris Flynn, vice president of F135 and F119 engines for Pratt, said the key to generating further savings would be increasing production rates. But production rates have not increased as much as expected, given the budget-driven reductions in orders from the U.S. military and  delays in orders from other countries. Mahr said lawyers from the Pentagon's F-35 office were negotiating with Pratt to publicly release more details on the cost of the engine, which the government buys separately from the airplane.Pratt argues it should not be required to disclose details about the costs of each engine since it could be involved in future competition.Pratt had no immediate comment on Mahr's remarks.Mahr said the overall F-35 program is making steady progress, although he said some technical issues still needed to be to resolved, including improving the performance of a complex computer-based logistics system called ALIS, and a recent crack in a fan blade on a Pratt engine. The Pentagon was also pressing the industry to lower the cost of building and operating the new jet, and making it more reliable, he said.

45,"  * FTSEurofirst 300 index falls 0.5 percent* Tech shares down 1.6 pct, tracks Nasdaq sell-off* Charts signal further weakness in near termBy Atul PrakashLONDON, April 14 European shares extended losses on Monday, with a major index slipping to its lowest level in three weeks, as fresh tension in Ukraine prompted investors to shun cyclical sectors such as travel, autos and technology.Charts also pointed to a bearish outlook in the near term and the broader market remained vulnerable to further sell-offs, technical analysts said.The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was down 0.5 percent at 1,305.78 points by 1017 GMT, after falling as low as 1,301.98, its weakest since late March. The index fell 3 percent last week, and analysts said the trouble in Ukraine could prevent it from bouncing back anytime soon.Cyclicals lost ground, with the STOXX Europe 600 Travel and Leisure index down 2.3 percent, tech shares  falling 1.9 percent and autos down 1.8 percent. However, losses were capped by a rise in some defensive sectors, such as personal and household goods and food and beverages, which were up more than 1 percent.""Geopolitical concerns are putting pressure on equities,"" said Christian Stocker, an equity strategist at UniCredit in Munich. ""Markets fear an escalation in tension will result in more economic sanctions on Russia and that will have a negative repercussion on Europe.""Ukraine gave pro-Russian separatists a deadline to disarm or face a ""full-scale anti-terrorist operation"". The UN's Security Council met in emergency session.Several firms exposed to Russia fell. Finnish tyre maker Nokian Renkaat, Austrian lender Raiffeisen Bank International, UniCredit, Italy's biggest bank by assets, and Belgian financial group KBC lost from 1.8 to 3.5 percent. Nokian Renkaat, Raiffeisen, UniCredit and KBC get 14 to 26 percent of their revenues from Russia. For a factbox on European firms most exposed to Russia, click onGermany's benchmark DAX index, which includes several companies with significant exposure to Russia, lagged the wider market, falling 0.7 percent.TECHNICAL OUTLOOK The euro zone's blue chip Euro STOXX 50 index  declined 0.7 percent to 3,094.87 points, with charts signalling that the index could fall further. ""Although the slope of the 200-day moving average remains up at this juncture, the Euro STOXX 50 index has turned down from the up-channel resistance line stretching back to 2011 and the move below support around 3,150 is another worry for bulls,"" said Murray Gunn, the head of technical analysis at HSBC.The index could find support around 2,971 points. On the upside, 3,196 is considered a strong resistance level.Among sectors, the STOXX Europe 600 tech index fell 1.6 percent, taking its losses since early April to more than 6 percent on concern that valuations have become stretched.Tech stocks are the most expensive in Europe, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. They trade at around 19 times their 12-month forward earnings, against a 10-year average of about 16 times and the STOXX 600's price-earnings ratio of 14.Ericsson fell 4.2 percent and ARM Holdings  2.2 percent, mirroring losses on the Nasdaq, which ended on Friday below 4,000 for the first time since early February.Among other sharp movers, Greece's largest lender, National Bank, fell 14 percent, making it the biggest decliner on the FTSEurofirst 300. A banker told Reuters on Saturday the bank might tap international markets with a share offering as part of plans to plug a capital shortfall.Despite recent jitters on Wall Street and simmering tensions in Ukraine, investors have continued to pour money into European equities.

63,"   By Lewis Krauskopf and Solarina Ho  The failure of a Pratt & Whitney jet engine during testing on a new Bombardier Inc plane last week is unlikely to have a significant impact on Bombardier's testing schedule, an executive at Pratt parent United Technologies Corp said on Thursday.""We're working now with Bombardier on a plan to resume testing here in the next few weeks,"" United Tech Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes told an investor conference.The engine failure had raised concern about potential further delays for Bombardier's new CSeries jet, which is already 18 to 24 months behind schedule. Hayes' comments confirmed cautious optimism in the industry and on Wall Street that the fallout from the May 29 incident would be limited.A problem with Pratt's engine that involved its signature gearing system, known as the Geared Turbofan, could have broader repercussions, since the engine is offered on Airbus's A320neo narrow-body plane and other new regional jets. Earlier on Thursday, Pratt announced it had delivered its first GTF engine to Mitsubishi Aircraft for its MRJ90 regional jet.But a preliminary analysis showed the engine problem during stationary testing on the Bombardier CSeries jet did not relate to the engine's gearing system, Hayes said. He added that the company has confidence in the engine's architecture. ""We think it was something much more simple than that,"" Hayes said, though he noted the investigation was still ongoing.""We believe we have an understanding of what occurred and if we’re correct, we think it can be rapidly fixed,"" he added.Hayes said he was confident United Tech would not face any significant financial exposure as a result of the incident. “If all of this comes true, then I would expect that this issue will not measurably impact their testing schedule or their delivery schedule,” said David Tyerman, a Toronto-based analyst at Canaccord Genuity. ""It would be removing an uncertainty related to the program, which is important.""The failure occurred last Thursday during stationary maintenance testing of the CSeries, which Montreal-based Bombardier has spent billions developing in an effort to compete in the narrow-body jet market with Boeing Co and Airbus.A Bombardier spokesman said the United Tech comments were a ""positive sign,"" but reiterated that the airplane maker was still expecting to release an update in the coming days.

""I am pleased that this contract has now been completed and that we can fulfill our government's commitment to begin to retire the Sea Kings in 2015, and deliver a new and leading maritime helicopter to the Royal Canadian Air Force,"" said Diane Finley, minister of public works and government services.Canada announced in September that it might scrap the deal and consider other options, but the two sides reached agreement in late December on how to revamp the contract. On Wednesday, Canada said Hitachi Consulting, an independent group that reviewed and verified the new contract structure, would continue to oversee aspects of the implementation plan, ensuring that delivery times remain as promised. Maurer told Reuters in a telephone interview that the deal removed a cloud of uncertainty that had been hanging over the program and could revive interest from other countries in the new helicopters, which are based on Sikorsky's S-92 helicopter. He said he expected interest to pick up once Canada began operating the new advanced helicopters, which can be used for a variety of missions, including hunting enemy submarines.Canada is already using four helicopters to train pilots and technicians. At least six more helicopters would be delivered as part of an initial block by the middle of 2015, Maurer said.

72,"  (Adds interview with Sikorksy president, byline)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON, June 18 United Technologies Corp  on Wednesday said its Sikorsky Aircraft unit would record sales of $850 million and a charge of $440 million in the second quarter after signing a revamped agreement with Canada for 28 maritime helicopters.The amendment to the long delayed multibillion dollar deal will allow Canada to start retiring its fleet of aging Sea King helicopters in 2015 and accelerate operations of the new CH-148 Cyclone helicopters, the company said in a statement.It said the charge would be offset by one-time gains during the course of 2014, and the company's forecast for earnings per share in 2014 remained unchanged at $6.65 to $6.85.""This agreement clears the way for us to deliver the world's most advanced maritime helicopter capability to the Royal Canadian Air Force,"" Sikorsky President Mick Maurer said in a statement. Public Works and Government Services Canada, which oversees defense procurements, said the government's budget of C$1.9 billion the helicopters remained unchanged, and it would spend C$5.7 billion for in-service support of the new fleet through 2038, 10 years longer than planned.""I am pleased that this contract has now been completed and that we can fulfill our government's commitment to begin to retire the Sea Kings in 2015, and deliver a new and leading maritime helicopter to the Royal Canadian Air Force,"" said Diane Finley, minister of public works and government services.Canada announced in September that it might scrap the deal and consider other options, but the two sides reached agreement in late December on how to revamp the contract. On Wednesday, Canada said Hitachi Consulting, an independent group that reviewed and verified the new contract structure, would continue to oversee aspects of the implementation plan, ensuring that delivery times remain as promised.Maurer told Reuters in a telephone interview that the deal removed a cloud of uncertainty that had been hanging over the program and could revive interest from other countries in the new helicopters, which are based on Sikorsky's S-92 helicopter. He said he expected interest to pick up once Canada began operating the new advanced helicopters, which can be used for a variety of missions, including hunting enemy submarines.Canada is already using four helicopters to train pilots and technicians. At least six more helicopters would be delivered as part of an initial block by the middle of 2015, Maurer said.By the middle of 2018, Sikorsky would deliver at least six more helicopters with further mission and software capabilities, as well as improved components that would reduce operating costs.Maurer said the new contract adopted a more phased approach for introduction of the new helicopters, a change from how the program was initially structured.""What we're going to be able to do it give them incremental improvement, with one block in 2015 and a second block in 2018 that gives them full capability over time,"" he said.

Sikorsky President Mick Maurer said the helicopters allowed the Air Force to ""perform one of its most important and sacred missions – bringing our downed service members home safely.""Air Force Secretary Deborah James said the Air Force was the key service responsible for global personnel recovery, and remained committed to a mission she described as ""part of the military ethos.""

The Air Force awarded Boeing Co (BA.N) a contract to build 141 rescue helicopters based on its twin-rotor CH-47 ""Chinook"" design in 2006, but the deal was protested immediately by the losing bidders - Sikorsky and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) - and later canceller by then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates.The Air Force restarted the program in 2012, but Boeing, Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) and Europe's Airbus (AIR.PA) later dropped out of the competition, arguing that the Air Force had skewed the requirements to favor Sikorsky's helicopter.In March, the Air Force's 2015 budget request to Congress omitted funding for the program, but officials added the program back in the same day under pressure from senior U.S. lawmakers.

The pilot was not injured.The incident is the latest to hit the Pentagon's costliest weapons program, the $398.6 billion F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. It followed an in-flight oil leak that triggered mandatory fleetwide inspections of the jets last month.""Additional inspections of F-35 engines have been ordered, and return to flight will be determined based on inspection results and analysis of engineering data,"" the Defense Department said in a brief statement issued late on Thursday.Pratt & Whitney said it was working closely with Air Force officials who are investigating the fire and are inspecting all engines in the fleet. Spokesman Jay DeFrank said it would be inappropriate to comment further since the incident was the subject of an investigation.The Pentagon's F-35 program office has made determining the cause of the fire its highest priority and it is assessing the impact on flight tests, training and operations of the radar-evading warplane. A person familiar with the situation said it was premature to rule in or out any quality problem or manufacturing defect.Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera he wanted to discuss the F-35 problem when he visits the United States next week to tour U.S. bases and meet with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel.""On my coming trip to the U.S. I plan to be reviewing troops and will have a chance to discuss the F-35 development on the ground,"" Onodera told a regular news conference.

Tokyo may order more F-35s when it decides the future of 100 of its older F-15s.Australia and South Korea said there had been no change to their plans to buy the fighter jets. Australia plans to buy 58 of the fighters and South Korea intends to buy 40. ""To date the JSF aircraft has accrued 15,000 flight hours While the F135 engine has successfully completed nearly 32,000 hours of testing,"" a spokesman for Australia's Defense Minister David Johnston said.""Single engine fighters are operated by many air forces and Defense remains confident the F-35 JSF will be reliable and safe."" Reuters reported on Wednesday that U.S. and British authorities were preparing directives ordering a mandatory engine inspection estimated to take about 90 minutes.British officials remained part of the discussions with U.S. officials and concurred with the U.S. recommendation to ground the jets, pending further inspection results, the F-35 program office said.The Pentagon said preparations were continuing for F-35 jets to participate in two UK air shows later this month, but a final decision would be made early next week. The fire has already derailed plans for an F-35 jet to fly by a naming ceremony for Britain's new aircraft carrier on Friday.The Royal International Air Tattoo (RITA) kicks off July 11 followed by the Farnborough International Air Show starting on July 14.

84,"   By Lewis Krauskopf  United Technologies Corp posted tepid quarterly orders for its Otis elevators and Pratt & Whitney jet engines businesses, and shares of the diversified U.S. manufacturer fell nearly 2 percent on Tuesday.The company also cut its cash flow forecast for the year, while analysts said higher-than-expected second-quarter profit was muddied by uncertainty over one-time gains and losses.Shares of United Tech, a Dow index member whose products serve the aerospace and commercial building sectors, were off 1.9 percent in mid-day trading, while those of most rival manufacturers traded higher. ""A little bit slower order growth may have spooked some people,"" Edward Jones analyst Christian Mayes said. ""We have had strong growth the last few quarters and it slowed down a bit.""Orders at Otis increased 3 percent but they were essentially unchanged in China, where the company is seeking to capitalize on rising urban populations.United Tech Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes noted that a year ago, orders at Otis had risen 39 percent in China, making for a difficult comparison this quarter.Analysts have been concerned that a slowdown in the Chinese economy could undermine United Tech's commercial building business, which also includes air conditioners and security systems.""The Chinese economy is cooling a little bit,"" Hayes said on a conference call with analysts. At Pratt, orders for commercial spare engines slumped 6 percent, reversing course after rising 11 percent in the first quarter.Sales at Pratt also slipped 0.9 percent. The unit is introducing a new engine expected to propel growth for years to come.United Tech's second-quarter net income rose 8 percent to $1.68 billion, or $1.84 per share.Analysts on average were looking for $1.71 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. ""Although EPS was a beat in the quarter, we think results on an underlying basis were essentially in-line,"" with various one-time items clouding expectations, RBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Stallard said in a research note.    Revenue rose 7 percent to $17.19 billion.United Tech's revenue increased 3 percent on an organic basis, which excludes sales from a helicopter agreement with Canada and net divestitures. The company said last month that it had signed a revamped agreement to provide Canada with maritime helicopters from its Sikorsky unit, with the deal leading to higher revenue in the second quarter but also to a $438 million charge to earnings. United Tech's aerospace components unit, UTC Aerospace Systems, was a bright spot in the quarter, with spare part orders jumping 28 percent.

Analysts had already been looking for $6.86 per share.""The Street was already near the top end of the company’s guidance, and with today’s (second-quarter) beat and not raising the top end of the guidance, it’s a de-facto lowering of the EPS guidance for the second half,"" said Jim Corridore, an equity analyst with S&P Capital IQ.The company said it now expected less than $1 billion in acquisitions for 2014, after previously projecting about $1 billion in deals.

85,"  (Rewrites to account for share price drop, adds further comment)By Lewis KrauskopfJuly 22 United Technologies Corp posted tepid quarterly orders for its Otis elevators and Pratt & Whitney jet engines businesses, and shares of the diversified U.S. manufacturer fell nearly 2 percent on Tuesday.The company also cut its cash flow forecast for the year, while analysts said higher-than-expected second-quarter profit was muddied by uncertainty over one-time gains and losses.Shares of United Tech, a Dow index member whose products serve the aerospace and commercial building sectors, were off 1.9 percent in mid-day trading, while those of most rival manufacturers traded higher.""A little bit slower order growth may have spooked some people,"" Edward Jones analyst Christian Mayes said. ""We have had strong growth the last few quarters and it slowed down a bit.""Orders at Otis increased 3 percent but they were essentially unchanged in China, where the company is seeking to capitalize on rising urban populations.United Tech Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes noted that a year ago, orders at Otis had risen 39 percent in China, making for a difficult comparison this quarter. Analysts have been concerned that a slowdown in the Chinese economy could undermine United Tech's commercial building business, which also includes air conditioners and security systems.""The Chinese economy is cooling a little bit,"" Hayes said on a conference call with analysts.At Pratt, orders for commercial spare engines slumped 6 percent, reversing course after rising 11 percent in the first quarter.Sales at Pratt also slipped 0.9 percent. The unit is introducing a new engine expected to propel growth for years to come. United Tech's second-quarter net income rose 8 percent to $1.68 billion, or $1.84 per share.Analysts on average were looking for $1.71 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.""Although EPS was a beat in the quarter, we think results on an underlying basis were essentially in-line,"" with various one-time items clouding expectations, RBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Stallard said in a research note.Revenue rose 7 percent to $17.19 billion. United Tech's revenue increased 3 percent on an organic basis, which excludes sales from a helicopter agreement with Canada and net divestitures.The company said last month that it had signed a revamped agreement to provide Canada with maritime helicopters from its Sikorsky unit, with the deal leading to higher revenue in the second quarter but also to a $438 million charge to earnings.United Tech's aerospace components unit, UTC Aerospace Systems, was a bright spot in the quarter, with spare part orders jumping 28 percent.United Tech projected 2014 earnings of $6.75 to $6.85 per share, raising the low end from $6.65.

101,"   By Lewis Krauskopf  United Technologies Corp unit Pratt & Whitney has sued a titanium supplier for fraud, after questions over the material led Pratt to briefly suspend delivery of its engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.Pratt said that A&P Alloys Inc, in West Bridgewater, Massachusetts, ""intentionally submitted certifications falsely representing the pedigree and quality of its material,"" according to court documents filed in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts on Friday.In the lawsuit, Pratt accuses A&P of fraud and breach of contract. An attorney for A&P Alloys said the company had not yet been served with the complaint.Last Friday, Pratt confirmed it had briefly suspended delivery of the strike fighter engine after it discovered conflicting documentation in late May that raised questions about the origin of the titanium.  Representatives of Pratt and the F-35 program office both said last week the material did not pose a risk to flight safety.In the lawsuit, Pratt said one of its parts suppliers, Lewis Machine LLC, ordered metal stock from A&P Alloys.

102,"   By Lewis Krauskopf | Sept 2  Sept 2 United Technologies Corp unit Pratt & Whitney has sued a titanium supplier for fraud, after questions over the material led Pratt to briefly suspend delivery of its engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.Pratt said that A&P Alloys Inc, in West Bridgewater, Massachusetts, ""intentionally submitted certifications falsely representing the pedigree and quality of its material,"" according to court documents filed in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts on Friday.In the lawsuit, Pratt accuses A&P of fraud and breach of contract. An attorney for A&P Alloys said the company had not yet been served with the complaint.Last Friday, Pratt confirmed it had briefly suspended delivery of the strike fighter engine after it discovered conflicting documentation in late May that raised questions about the origin of the titanium. Representatives of Pratt and the F-35 program office both said last week the material did not pose a risk to flight safety.In the lawsuit, Pratt said one of its parts suppliers, Lewis Machine LLC, ordered metal stock from A&P Alloys. Pratt is suing for damages and attorneys fees arising from fraudulent misrepresentations about the metals and attempts to impede Pratt's efforts to uncover the alleged misconduct, according to the lawsuit.According to the lawsuit, A&P's owner denied representatives from Pratt and Lewis access to A&P's headquarters when they were seeking documents and refused to turn over requested records.

103,"  (Adds military comments)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON, Sept 9 United Technologies Corp's  Pratt & Whitney unit said the ""root cause"" of the June 23 engine failure on a Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 fighter jet should be clear by the end of September, which would pave the way for over $1 billion in contracts for another 84 engines.Engine maker Pratt & Whitney said it has delivered six of its F135 engines to the U.S. government since Aug. 29, when it resumed deliveries that had been halted after the June incident which grounded the F-35 fleet for weeks and prevented its international debut.Bennett Croswell, president of Pratt & Whitney Military Engines, said he still hoped to keep the government's flight test plan on track through a series of measures aimed at addressing the issue and lifting restrictions on test aircraft.""I believe that through the combination of things we will keep the flight test program on track,"" Croswell told the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit.Separately at the Reuters summit, officials from the military and Lockheed echoed the timeline for identifying the cause of the engine incident.""We're reasonably confident we're looking at the right thing, and then we're reasonably confident it's going to prove out in the next couple of weeks,"" Rear Admiral Randy Mahr, deputy director of the F-35 program, told the summit. In June, an Air Force F-35A training jet caught fire after its Pratt engine broke apart and ripped a fuel line as the jet prepared to take off from Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. U.S. officials blame the incident on excessive rubbing of part of the engine's fan section against an adjacent seal.The incident has raised fresh concerns about the $400 billion F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, the Pentagon's largest-ever arms program, which is about 70 percent over initial cost estimates and years behind schedule.U.S. officials say the program is back on track after earlier problems, although Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan last week said the engine issue had put the development program about 30 to 45 days behind schedule.Croswell said Pratt was taking the issue very seriously and expected it to be resolved ""in relatively short order."" He also noted that such problems were meant to be found during the design and development phase of any new program. The fix should be moderate in cost, Croswell said.""It should not be a very expensive solution,"" he said, noting that retrofits would be possible without an expensive tear-apart of the F-35's powerful engine.Croswell said Pratt had essentially wrapped up negotiations with the Pentagon on the 84 engines in the seventh and eighth low rate production contracts, but Bogdan wanted a clearer understanding of the root cause of the incident before signing off on an agreement valued at over $1 billion.The Pentagon is negotiating a separate contract with Lockheed for an eighth batch of jets. Croswell confirmed that Pratt would pay to fix the current issue and said the company had also agreed to share in the cost of future problems, but details were still being finalized.""We have agreed in principle to provide a warranty to the U.S. government for future LRIP contracts. We have not yet finalized a warranty agreement, but P&W would likely pay a percentage of the total cost of certain performance specification shortfalls,"" spokesman Matthew Bates said.Croswell said the engine failure came about eight hours after an unusual maneuver involving a roll, yaw and heavy gravity loads during sharp turns. ""This is a maneuver that the engine should be able to withstand,"" he said.Croswell said Pratt had already completed a baseline test  of the current engine at its West Palm Beach, Florida facility, and had begun testing possible fixes. He said the company was investigating whether the density of the polyimide, a rubbery material made by Dupont, had played a role.The part that broke apart ties the fan blades together.

104,"  WASHINGTON The U.S. Defense Department on Tuesday said it expects to wrap up contract talks in coming days or weeks with Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) about an eighth batch of F-35 fighter jets, and is also close to an agreement with engine maker Pratt & Whitney (UTX.N).Rear Admiral Randy Mahr, deputy F-35 program manager, said the department had decided to negotiate the next two production contracts with Lockheed at the same time to secure better pricing given the higher order quantities. Those contracts would still be awarded to the company one year at a time given restrictions on multi-year contracts, he added.

""Unity in this is absolutely crucial and strategic,"" she said.EU diplomats said that countries with close ties to Russia such as Italy, Austria and Finland are reluctant to implement the new sanctions. German Chancellor Angela Merkel called for the sanctions to go ahead, adding that they could always be suspended at a later date if there was progress towards a peace plan for Ukraine.""We are in favour of making these sanctions public now,"" Merkel told the German parliament.Ukraine's president said on Wednesday Russia had removed the bulk of its forces from his country, raising hopes for a peace drive now underway after five months of conflict in which more than 3,000 people have been killed. EU diplomats said, however, that the general idea was still for the sanctions to be implemented through publication in the Official Journal of the European Union on Friday.The EU sanctions list dated Sept.6 shows battle-tank maker Uralvagonzavod, aerospace company Oboronprom and state-controlled United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) are among Russian companies to face new EU sanctions if the bloc decides to implement them, according to a draft obtained by Reuters.Oboronprom is the main shareholder in Russia's top producer of civilian and military helicopters: Russian Helicopters. Uralvagonzavod is a maker of Russian battle-tanks.

Russia's ambassador spoke to the head of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, who chairs EU summits, and the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs Catherine Ashton on Monday, diplomats said.His message was that the EU should look at what was happening on the ground in Ukraine and reflect on its position that the ceasefire was holding.One of the difficulties in making a decision on sanctions implementation is that the EU has no agreed way to establish if the ceasefire in Ukraine is holding - it is up to individual governments to make their own assessment.

110,"  (Adds response by lawyers for both sides in lawsuit, paragraph 5)By Emily FlitterNEW YORK, Sept 12 The U.S. government has moved to invoke a powerful national security law to dismiss a private lawsuit against a non-profit group, United Against A Nuclear Iran, on grounds that the case could reveal state secrets, according to a court filing on Friday.Lawyers for the government argued that proceedings in the private dispute between a Greek businessman and U.S.-based UANI could ""cause harm to national security"" if they are allowed to continue. The document in federal court in New York said the secrets were ""properly classified national security information"" which would be described in another filing that would not be made public. Greek businessman and ship owner Victor Restis last year sued UANI for defamation after UANI, whose advisors include former intelligence officials from the United States, Europe and Israel, accused him of violating sanctions on Iran by exporting oil from the country.UANI advocates economic pressure on Iran to keep over its nuclear program. Iran denies Western accusations that it has been seeking the capability to assemble nuclear weapons. One of UANI's tactics is to name and shame companies and people who do business in Iran. In an emailed statement, UANI's lawyer said he believed Restis' complaint was without merit. Restis' lawyer declined to comment before filing a formal response in court.Earlier this year, U.S. government lawyers declared their interest in the lawsuit, warning that information related to UANI could jeopardize law enforcement activities such as ongoing investigations. The state secrets privilege is more powerful than the one the government would have used to protect law enforcement activities. It refers specifically to matters of national security.It is used far more sparingly than the law enforcement privilege. In Friday's court filing U.S. Department of Justice lawyers pointed to another example in which the government invoked it to try to dismiss a defamation lawsuit in 1985 by a man claiming Penthouse Magazine had wrongly accused him of being a spy.The case is Restis et al v. American Coalition Against Nuclear Iran Inc, (dba United Against A Nuclear Iran) et al, in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 13-05032.

111,"   By Lewis Krauskopf  General Electric Co (GE.N) avoided using a geared design for its new engine for narrowbody jets because of concerns about weight and reliability, said a top GE executive on Monday as it battles with rival Pratt & Whitney for billions of dollars in engine orders.Pratt, part of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), developed a geared turbofan that relies on a gearbox and lets the front fan operate at a different speed than the rest of the engine, while on GE's traditionally configured engines the fans run at the same speed.Speaking at a Morgan Stanley investor conference, GE Chief Technology Officer Mark Little said the company had ""considered a geared approach ... and we chose very consciously not to take that approach.""""Some other application someday, maybe, but not for this one,"" Little said at the conference in Dana Point, California, that was broadcast over the Internet.Through its joint venture called CFM with France's Safran (SAF.PA), GE is competing against Pratt for airline and other customers that choose Airbus' (AIR.PA) new A320neo single-aisle plane. Both engines promise significant fuel savings over older models, and Airbus buyers can choose the Pratt or CFM engine.     CFM's LEAP, among other improvements, uses new materials designed to reduce weight and add durability.""We thought that the addition of the extra component would add reliability and weight challenges, and durability challenges that we could avoid by going the path we went,"" Little said.""We like the bet that we've made,"" Little said. In response to Little's comments, Pratt & Whitney spokeswoman Sara Banda said: ""We are confident in our PurePower Geared Turbofan engine technology and this is not just us saying this,"" noting that in addition to Airbus, four other aircraft makers have selected the GTF, including Embraer (EMBR3.SA) and Bombardier Inc (BBDb.TO).Pratt has completed more than 10,000 hours of testing for the GTF engine family, Banda said in an email, after 20 years of research and $1 billion invested into developing the engine.Barry Eccleston, president of Airbus Americas Inc, told the Reuters Aerospace and Defense summit last week that of A320neo customers, so far about one-third have chosen the LEAP, one-third have selected the GTF, while one-third remain undecided. Pratt has had a smaller presence among commercial engines in recent years, so the GTF engine is its bid to return to prominence. By contrast, CFM has been the dominant engine on the narrowbody planes, including capturing a major portion of the new narrow-body market because it is the sole engine on Boeing Co's (BA.N) 737 MAX. The geared engine architecture won a vote of confidence in February, when Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (RR.L) also said it was pursuing such an approach for its future engines.Airbus has said the first A320neo flight, which will use Pratt's GTF engine, is expected sometime this month.

114,"   By Lewis Krauskopf  U.S. manufacturer United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) is looking for large acquisitions, but does not see a wealth of opportunities with the soaring stock market driving up prices, the company's chief financial officer said on Tuesday.""We continue to look for opportunities to do large-scale M&A,"" United Technologies Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes told an investor conference. ""At $65 billion (in annual revenue), you have got to do bigger deals to move the needle.""But when asked how he viewed the deal pipeline, Hayes responded: ""Not terribly robust.""United Technologies' products fall under two areas: aerospace, including Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Sikorsky helicopters; and commercial buildings, including Otis elevators and Carrier climate control systems.Hayes' comments echoed those he gave at United Technologies investor meeting in March, when he said the company was more focused on bigger deals, but did not expect to strike such a deal in the near-term.  Speaking at a Morgan Stanley conference on Tuesday, Hayes said more opportunities existed in the commercial building area than in aerospace, but noted that ""equity prices continue to accelerate.""Hayes said the company was focused on deals that could generate significant cost savings, as occurred with its $16 billion deal for aircraft components maker Goodrich Corp struck a few years ago.

115,"  (Corrects throughout to read United Technologies instead of United Technology)By Lewis KrauskopfSept 16 U.S. manufacturer United Technologies Corp is looking for large acquisitions, but does not see a wealth of opportunities with the soaring stock market driving up prices, the company's chief financial officer said on Tuesday.""We continue to look for opportunities to do large-scale M&A,"" United Technologies Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes told an investor conference. ""At $65 billion (in annual revenue), you have got to do bigger deals to move the needle.""But when asked how he viewed the deal pipeline, Hayes responded: ""Not terribly robust.""United Technologies' products fall under two areas: aerospace, including Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Sikorsky helicopters; and commercial buildings, including Otis elevators and Carrier climate control systems. Hayes' comments echoed those he gave at United Technologies investor meeting in March, when he said the company was more focused on bigger deals, but did not expect to strike such a deal in the near-term.Speaking at a Morgan Stanley conference on Tuesday, Hayes said more opportunities existed in the commercial building area than in aerospace, but noted that ""equity prices continue to accelerate.""

116,"  (Corrects name of United Technologies unit in penultimate para)* Airbus expects 3,500 A320neo sales by year end* Boeing bringing out updated version of rival 737By Tim HepherTOULOUSE, France, Sept 25 Airbus  successfully staged the maiden test flight on Thursday of an upgraded passenger jet on which it expects to generate hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue, buoyed by an increase in the company's jet demand forecast.The A320neo touched down in Toulouse, southwest France, 27 years after the original A320 first took to the skies and opened up fierce competition with Boeing's medium-haul 737 in a slice of the jet market estimated at $2 trillion over 20 years.Powered by a new type of jet engine from Pratt & Whitney , the A320neo flew for two hours and 22 minutes, kicking off a year of flight trials. The same family of aircraft will also offer a competing engine from CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric and Safran.Airbus is aiming for savings of 15 percent per seat compared with the current generation of medium-haul passenger jets. It said this gap would increase to 20 percent by 2020 thanks in part to a further two percent improvement due to be delivered by Pratt & Whitney, on top of its 12 percent contribution to the current improvement. The rest will come by adding more seats.With airlines running on wafer-thin profit margins and spending about 40 percent of their operating costs on fuel, such savings are at the centre of a huge sales battle.Rival Boeing is bringing out its own updated version of the 737 just over a year after Airbus and the two companies face a gradual threat to their duopoly at the small end of the market from new competitors in Canada, Brazil, China and Russia.A smooth entry to service will however cement their position as market leaders for years to come, analysts say, Shares in both companies have risen sharply since the decision to revamp their most-sold aircraft was announced in 2010 and 2011. Airbus shares rose over 2 percent on Thursday.Airbus has sold 3,257 A320neo aircraft and said it expects this to reach 3,500 by the end of the year. Together, Airbus and Boeing have sold well over 5,000 of the planes.Both companies have announced increases in production as a result, and are considering further increases to lift A320 or 737 production to 50 planes a month or beyond. Airbus Chief Executive Fabrice Bregier however said it was  in ""no rush"" to make a further output decision.Airbus raised its 20-year forecast for jet demand on Wednesday, citing growth in emerging markets, with China on the brink of becoming the world's aviation powerhouse.The flight went ahead in September as planners hoped after last-minute signs of concern about the engine's readiness and the recent resumption of flight tests on Bombardier's  CSeries aircraft, which uses similar Pratt & Whitney engines.An engine blowout in May had halted CSeries flight testing.The companies indicated they were convinced that the Airbus version of the engine would not be affected by the same problems and that the aircraft would enter service with the same high reliability as the existing generation of small jets.""It is a great engine that is going to change the economics of the airline industry,"" said Alain Bellemare, chief executive of UTC Propulsion and Aerospace Systems at Pratt & Whitney parent United Technologies.""We are highly confident in the performance of these engines,"" he told Reuters.

117,"  * F-35A seen combat ready by mid-2015* Pratt & Whitney to implement engine fix early 2015* Expected higher orders will drive down per-unit cost-execOSLO, Sept 25 Lockheed Martin expects the cost of the F-35 fighter jet to drop to its target level by 2019 and still sees the first version of the aircraft combat ready by mid-2015, despite an engine fire which still needs a fix, the firm said on Thursday.A decision by South Korea on Wednesday to order 40 F-35s for around $7 billion further lowers the programme's cost and Lockheed sees the per-unit cost down to $80-$85 million by 2019 from the current rate of around $115 million, Jeff Babione, Lockheed's deputy general manager for the F-35 programme told reporters in Oslo. Lockheed, engine maker Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp, and other suppliers are investing heavily to drive down the programme's projected $400 billion cost, making it more affordable for cash-strapped governments looking to buy over 3,100 aircraft over the next decades.""The cost reduction will come with the increase in orders,"" Babione told Reuters on the sidelines of a press conference. ""We anticipate that there's a market out there for 4,000 airplanes ... and the biggest risk to cost is if we don't get the orders we showed. That will significantly erode our ability to take advantage of economic order quantities and reduce cost.""The F-35 programme was set back earlier this year when the Pentagon grounded its entire fleet after a June 23 fire on an Air Force F-35A jet, an all new aircraft with advanced stealth capabilities, improved manoeuvrability and advanced sensors. Lockheed is still investigating the issue and expects to determine the root cause this month or early October, and sees a fix implemented on aircraft already in service in early 2015, Chris Flynn, a Pratt & Whitney vice-president for the F-35 engine programme said.""We understand what fundamentally happened ... and we have tremendous confidences in the timeline,"" Flynn said. ""We think it's a fairly straightforward fix.""Though no longer grounded, the fleet of over 100 F-35s already delivered, flies under restrictions, pending the engine fix.Lockheed added it was also confident that the U.S. Marine Corps would declare the first version of the jet combat ready by mid-2015 and said that beside the engine issue, the integration of the communication systems and the subtle changes to flight controls were its main issues.

118,"  (Adds Pratt president, analyst comments, details on announcement, background)By Lewis KrauskopfOct 2 United Technologies Corp's Pratt & Whitney unit on Thursday named a new head of its commercial engines division in the midst of a crucial launch of a commercial jet engine.Pratt appointed Gregory Gernhardt as president of Pratt & Whitney Commercial Engines, effective immediately. He replaces David Brantner, who was named to the commercial engine leadership post in June 2013.Brantner ""has decided to depart the company,"" Pratt said in a statement. Industry sources who declined to be named said Brantner is leaving voluntarily for a senior position at another aerospace company and had not been pushed out. Pratt's new geared turbofan, or GTF, is helping revitalize its commercial engine business. The engine is offered on Airbus'  A320neo narrow-body plane, which had its maiden flight last week, and other new jets. Pratt has invested $1 billion developing the engine, which has more than 6,000 orders and commitments.Gernhardt, 49, previously was responsible for the engine's A320neo program, seen as the GTF's most important program.In a statement, Pratt President Paul Adams said Gernhardt was ""well prepared"" for his new role and brings ""demonstrated leadership capabilities honed during 25 years of engine experience in engineering, program management, sales and customer service."" Given the large backlog of orders, one issue Pratt could face is whether it can ramp up production quickly and smoothly, analysts have said. Aside from the GTF, Pratt is a major military contractor and provides the engine for Lockheed Martin Corp's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the Pentagon's largest-ever arms program.On the A320neo, Pratt's GTF is competing with the LEAP engine from CFM, a joint venture between General Electric Co  and France's Safran. Both engines promise significant fuel savings over older models, and Airbus buyers can choose the Pratt or CFM engine. Another version of the GTF is being used to power Bombardier's CSeries aircraft. The Bombardier plane suffered an on-ground engine failure in May, but test flights resumed last month.Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at the Teal Group, said it was notable that the leadership change happened after the first A320neo flight and the resumption of flying for the CSeries, and it was not something that should alarm customers.""If you were going to make a career move, you'd wait until you checked two boxes like this,"" Aboulafia said. ""I don't think there's any overhang from this.""United Tech shares closed down 0.6 percent at $103.24 on the New York Stock Exchange.

132,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Engine maker Pratt & Whitney on Thursday said it had won a contract to build an eighth batch of 48 engines for the F-35 fighter jet built by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), bringing the total value of the deal to $1.05 billion.Pratt, a unit of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), said the new contract was for $793 million, on top of $259 million in preliminary funds awarded and would lower the average cost of the engines between 3.5 percent and 4.5 percent.Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan, program executive officer for the Pentagon's F-35 program, welcomed the cost cuts in the new contract, which follow an average 4.4 percent cost reduction in the seventh batch of engines.The cumulative reduction of about 9 percent in the two contracts showed Pratt's renewed commitment to the ""war on cost"" it initiated several years ago, Bogdan told reporters at the headquarters of the F-35 program. He said he would continue to press the company for further cuts in the cost of the F135 engine that powers the newest and most advanced U.S. warplane.Neither Pratt nor the Pentagon disclosed the specific cost of each engine under the new contract.  Chris Flynn, who runs the F135 and F119 engine programs for Pratt, said the company and its suppliers remained focused on pushing the price even lower and meeting the goals outlined in the company's cost reduction initiative.""Pratt & Whitney and our supply base remain focused on delivering the F135 propulsion system on or below the cost targets we committed to for our customer,"" Flynn said in a statement. Bogdan said the Pentagon planned to negotiate separate contracts with both Lockheed and Pratt for the ninth and tenth batches of jets and engines in coming months, with a goal of reaching agreement with the companies by the fall of 2015. He reaffirmed the program's goal of reaching a price tag of $80 million to $85 million per aircraft by 2019.In addition, he said the Pentagon and Lockheed expected to generate ""substantial"" cost reductions in the F-35 fighter jets being sold to foreign countries by combining their cumulative orders instead of negotiating one year of orders at a time.That meant that U.S. allies who participated in such a ""block buy"" could for a time see lower F-35 prices than the U.S. military, which must meet certain strict conditions set by Congress to enable multiyear purchases, Bogdan said. In later years, once the F-35 reaches full-rate production, the U.S. military could also shift to multiyear contracts.The changes could drive the cost of the aircraft even lower than the current target of $80 million to $85 million, he said.Bogdan said he was confident that Pratt and the Pentagon had solutions in place that would allow the program to resume normal flight operations after a massive engine failure on June 23 that grounded the entire F-35 fleet for several weeks this summer.

145,"   By Richard Beales | NEW YORK  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Like company bosses themselves, boards sometimes think chief executives are indispensable. Not at United Technologies. Late last month, Louis Chenevert stepped down unexpectedly. It turns out he was spending too much time thinking about the construction of his yacht and other personal matters. Kudos to the company's board for letting him go.The directors had a strong in-house replacement at hand in Gregory Hayes. That ensured that investors barely blinked at the changeover at the top of the $100 billion UTC, which makes Sikorsky helicopters and Pratt & Whitney jet engines, among other products. The main point, though, is that lead independent director Edward Kangas, now chairman, had enough courage and support from his fellow board members to challenge the CEO.Many boards only bring themselves to oust a company's top executive - especially one who's also chairman, as Chenevert was - when they are besieged by disgruntled investors and hounded by inquiring reporters. Kangas and his colleagues, in contrast, took the initiative. The Wall Street Journal reports that some senior managers and directors felt Chenevert was becoming more and more distracted. According to the newspaper, the final straw may have been a side trip the UTC boss took to Taiwan to check on the construction of his yacht. Getting financial incentives right isn't sufficient. Chenevert's reported compensation for 2013, after all, was $20 million. That should be enough to keep anyone focused. Separating the chairman's job from the CEO's is one way companies can help ensure that a chief executive remains committed. The title of chairman intuitively confers that kind of responsibility. The UTC example shows that a properly empowered lead director can also do the job. Either way, it's a lesson for other boards in the importance of taking the lead on governance. CONTEXT NEWS  -  Edward Kangas, United Technologies' new chairman, said former Chief Executive Louis Chenevert stepped down late last month after Kangas, then lead independent director, spoke to him out of concern about his priorities. The U.S. aerospace and defense conglomerate's Nov. 24 announcement came as a surprise to investors.- Kangas first made the comments in a Dec. 5 article in the Wall Street Journal. According to the article, which cited anonymous sources, there was concern among directors and senior managers at UTC that Chenevert was disengaged from the details of the company's operations and too focused on private interests such as his yacht, which is under construction in Taiwan, according to the newspaper.- WSJ: UTC boss sails off after trip to yacht: on.wsj.com/1scy0Fe   (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

Hayes, speaking at a meeting of analysts and investors in New York, initially said: ""We're not going to sell Sikorsky."" But, later in the meeting, he said: ""Anything is for sale at the right price.""""There's no sacred cows out there,"" Hayes told reporters after the meeting.Shares were down 1.8 percent in after-hours trading.

He told reporters, ""If there's a $20, or even $30 billion deal out there, we're not going to say no.""Although Pratt & Whitney is expecting a huge jump in production over the next five years, expenses tied to the production increase will hurt profit next year. The unit also faces pressures in its pension plans.""Pratt faces some significant headwinds on this ramp-up,"" Hayes said. The company, which also makes Otis elevators and Carrier climate control systems, forecast 2015 earnings in a range of $7.00 to $7.20, growth of 3 percent to 6 percent. It forecast sales for 2015 to be between $66 billion to $67 billion, including 3 to 5 percent organic growth.

161,"  (Rewrites throughout, adds comments from CEO)By Lewis Krauskopf and Rohit T. K.Dec 11 United Technologies Corp's new chief executive on Thursday forecast 2015 profit below Wall Street's target as profit falls at its Pratt & Whitney jet engine business, and said there were ""no sacred cows"" with the conglomerate's businesses.In his debut as CEO after six years as the U.S. conglomerate's finance chief, Greg Hayes said the company would look at the company's portfolio in a ""disciplined"" way, following speculation on Wall Street that he might be open to shaking up the company's structure.The future of Sikorsky, the maker of Black Hawk helicopters, has particularly been questioned, owning in part to its relatively low profit margins.Hayes, speaking at a meeting of analysts and investors in New York, initially said: ""We're not going to sell Sikorsky."" But, later in the meeting, he said: ""Anything is for sale at the right price.""""There's no sacred cows out there,"" Hayes told reporters after the meeting. Shares were down 1.8 percent in after-hours trading.Hayes also said he wanted to get more ""aggressive"" on acquisitions, with him personally getting more involved. He told reporters, ""If there's a $20, or even $30 billion deal out there, we're not going to say no.""Although Pratt & Whitney is expecting a huge jump in production over the next five years, expenses tied to the production increase will hurt profit next year. The unit also faces pressures in its pension plans. ""Pratt faces some significant headwinds on this ramp-up,"" Hayes said.The company, which also makes Otis elevators and Carrier climate control systems, forecast 2015 earnings in a range of $7.00 to $7.20, growth of 3 percent to 6 percent.It forecast sales for 2015 to be between $66 billion to $67 billion, including 3 to 5 percent organic growth. Analysts on average were looking for $7.27 per share on sales of $67.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Ahead of the meeting, many analysts and investors said they expected Hayes to be conservative with his initial forecast.The company expects share repurchases between $2 billion to $3 billion next year, with Hayes saying the stock is undervalued.The stock's performance has ""not been very good"" in the past couple of years, Hayes said.Hayes also praised his predecessor, Louis Chenevert, whose retirement as CEO announced on Nov. 24 stunned Wall Street.Chenevert ""has really left us with a great hand,"" Hayes said in opening comments.

162,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Dec 22 The Pentagon's internal watchdog on Monday questioned whether the U.S. government is paying United Technologies Corp too much to maintain the F117 engines that power Boeing Co's C-17 cargo plane, and it urged greater oversight.The Pentagon's inspector general faulted the Air Force for buying $1.54 billion worth of maintenance and repair services on a sole-source, commercial basis, without first assessing if a commercial market existed for the services.It recommended that the Pentagon's director of pricing block further Air Force contracts for F117 maintenance with Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies, until Pratt provided the information needed to evaluate whether the Air Force was getting a ""fair and reasonable price"" for the work.Tensions are growing between weapons makers and the Pentagon over the treatment of commercial items and services. When the U.S. military buys items considered commercial, it generally pays less but also receives less detailed cost or pricing information than in cases involving non-commercial items developed solely for the government. Pratt said it believed it had provided the Air Force sufficient data to declare ""commerciality,"" and that its investment in the F117 engine had saved the government significant operations and maintenance costs.Pratt & Whitney spokesman Matthew Bates said the company's performance-based logistics system for servicing the F117 engine had tripled the time it could be used, eliminating 1,000 shop visits and saving $3 billion in costs. The F117 is a common derivative of the successful PW2000 engine, which powers the Boeing 757. Pratt funded its development and has sold this engine commercially to the Air Force since the early 1990s. The company and a large number of commercial airlines and repair facilities have been providing commercial overhaul and repair services for the engine for over 25 years.The watchdog report urged the Air Force to review how well its officials complied with rules for determining commerciality, and to consider corrective actions as appropriate. It also recommended:* The Air Force contracting officer be required to obtain necessary documents to support the commercial nature of the F117 sustainment contract, or deem the work non-commercial.* The Air Force prepare a written plan to develop a competitive market for F117 engine sustainment.* The Pentagon's director of pricing establish policy for oversight of future Air Force contracts with Pratt and Whitney.

174,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Feb 5 Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp, is seeing a big spike in demand for its UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters from Eastern Europe, a top company executive said on Thursday.Several Eastern European countries have already submitted a formal request for the aircraft to the U.S. government, Samir Mehta, president of Sikorsky Defense Systems & Services, told reporters at the company's Washington office.Mehta said demand for the popular workhorse utility helicopters was being driven by continued tensions with Russia and growing concerns in countries in the region about suppliers for their existing Russian-built helicopters.""In Eastern Europe, we're seeing a renewed sense of urgency around acquiring Western equipment,"" Mehta said. He said Slovakia was one country that had expressed interest, but did not name other potential buyers.Mehta said increasing calls to provide weapons to Ukraine could also result in new orders but said discussions were being held on a government-to-government basis. One option, he said, would be to rebuild older-model Black Hawks that are being taken out of inventory by the U.S. Army. Mehta said it would take about a year to upgrade such older Black Hawks for use by foreign countries.President Barack Obama will decide soon whether to provide Kiev with lethal weapons to fight pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, Secretary of State John Kerry said on Thursday. {ID:nL6N0VF5FY] Sikorsky is looking to foreign sales and other opportunities to offset the end of U.S. orders for its Black Hawks. The Pentagon's fiscal 2016 budget plan includes funding for the final year of a multiyear production contract.Last year, Sikorsky won contracts for several major new programs, including a combat rescue helicopter for the Air Force and a presidential helicopter for the Navy. But those projects are still in development and will not contribute as much to revenues as production of existing aircraft for some time.Mehta welcomed the U.S. government's announcement Wednesday of a two-year project aimed at making it easier for NATO and member countries to share costs and buy weapons as a group as they struggle to stretch scarce defense budgets.He said the initiative could help smaller countries in Eastern Europe by aggregating their orders to drive down prices. It would also help lower the cost of maintaining aircraft by spreading the cost over a large number of planes, he said.

Pratt said it has cut the cost of the F135 engine by 55 percent since its first delivery.The U.S. government signs separate production agreements with Lockheed Martin Corp, which builds the plane, and Pratt, which builds the engine. The Pentagon plans to spend nearly $400 billion to develop and build 2,457 of the radar-evading warplanes over the next two decades. Croswell welcomed the start of a long-delayed increase in production of the F-35 in the fiscal 2016 budget, which funds 57 jets after 38 a year earlier, and said it would help Pratt, Lockheed and other key suppliers drive down the plane's cost.Pratt and Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc, which makes the lift fan for the F-35 B-model, are finalizing plans for further reducing the engine's cost, Croswell said. He gave no details. Lockheed and the other key suppliers for the airframe - Northrop Grumman Corp and BAE Systems Plc  -launched a similar effort last summer, which maps out specific investments to reduce the cost to build and repair the planes.Croswell said Pratt had also developed plans to upgrade the F135 engine in two separate phases.If the Pentagon accepts and funds the plans, the first upgrades would begin in 2017 or 2018 and reduce the fuel burn of the engine by 5 to 7 percent, Croswell said. The next upgrades would begin around 2022, cutting fuel burn by a further 15 to 20 percent.The upgrades draw on research work funded by the Air Force and the Navy in recent years. The Air Force included funding for more work on a next-generation engine in its 2016 budget plan.

177,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Feb 5 The Pentagon's plans to fund 50 percent more F-35 fighter jets in fiscal 2016 will help drive down the price of the new plane and its engine, a top official with enginemaker Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp, said Thursday.Bennett Croswell, president of Pratt's military engines division, said the company had submitted a proposal for the ninth and tenth batches of engines to the F-35 program office, and he hoped to sign those agreements by the end of 2015.The previous two production agreements lowered the cost of the engine by nearly 8 percent, Croswell said, noting that further reductions were planned for the contracts now under discussion - 60 engines in the ninth batch and 100 in the tenth.The U.S. government signs separate production agreements with Lockheed Martin Corp, which builds the plane, and Pratt, which builds its F135 engine.

185,"   By Sweta Singh and Sagarika Jaisinghani | BENGALURU, India  BENGALURU, India Feb 19 Sikorsky Aircraft Corp, a unit of United Technologies Corp, is keen to sell VVIP transport helicopters to the Indian government, a company executive told Reuters.India cancelled a $770 million deal for 12 VVIP helicopters - used to carry high-ranking officials - with Italian defence group Finmeccanica's AgustaWestland unit last year over a corruption scandal.Industry sources in India expect a new tender this year. Sikorsky, which pitched its S-92 helicopter but lost to AgustaWestland in the initial tender, could take part once again. ""We told the Indian government we have great VVIP helicopters and we are ready to support you,"" said Robert Kokorda, vice president of defence systems and services at Sikorsky, at the Aero India show in Bengaluru.""If they issue a request for information, we'll evaluate it and we'll be ready,"" Kokorda said. India needs 12 helicopters to replace its Russia-made Mi-8 aircraft. After the cancellation of the AW101 order, it modified some of its Mi-17 helicopters for VVIP missions. Russian Helicopters could also bid for a new contract using Mi-17s while Airbus Helicopters could enter the fray with its EC225. Russian Helicopters declined to comment while Airbus Helicopters executives could not be reached.In May 2014, Sikorsky won an initial $1.24 billion contract to develop and build six U.S. presidential helicopters, the first step toward a fleet of 21 new aircraft by 2023. It has built all US presidential helicopters since 1957.Last year, an Italian court sentenced former Finmeccanica Chairman and CEO Giuseppe Orsi to two years in jail for falsifying invoices in a corruption case linked to the cancelled Indian deal. Former AgustaWestland head Bruno Spagnolini was also sentenced to two years in jail on false invoice charges, but acquitted of the corruption accusations.

186,"   By Siva Govindasamy | BENGALURU  BENGALURU Feb 19 Russia could assemble the Sukhoi Superjet regional jet in India to take advantage of lower production costs, the president of the plane's maker United Aircraft Co (UAC) said on Thursday.UAC executives had visited several Indian aircraft assembly facilities in India and were impressed with their capabilities, Yury Slyusar, UAC's new president, said at a press conference in the Aero India air show in Bengaluru.""We are looking at domestic production (in India) to help reduce the final price of the aircraft,"" he said. This will also support Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""Make in India"" campaign, he added.He declined to say when an agreement might be reached.State-owned Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) has the only complete aircraft production facility in India. Companies such as Tata Sons, Reliance Group and Mahindra & Mahindra have also been keen to move into the industry. Producing the Superjet, which can seat up to 100 passengers, in India would chime with the country's nascent hopes of designing and producing a passenger aircraft.State-owned research agency National Aerospace Laboratories and HAL have, for the past few years, separately worked on a Regional Transport Aircraft (RTA) programme to develop a plane that can carry around 100 passengers. UAC manufactures the Superjet as part of a joint venture with Italy's Alenia Aermacchi, a subsidiary of Finmeccanica . Just over 50 aircraft have been delivered since 2011, with the joint venture having orders for around 300 planes.Brazil's Embraer dominates the market for regional aircraft, which connect large airport hubs with smaller cities that have high demand for flights but low passenger numbers. Japan's Mitsubishi Aircraft, which counts Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Toyota among its investors, has developed the MRJ regional jet to compete with Embraer.Canada's Bombardier also produces regional jets. Aviation consultancy Flightglobal Ascend has forecast a market for 4,071 regional jets worth $128.3 billion by 2033.UAC officials also confirmed they had begun work with China on the preliminary design of a proposed 250 to 280 seat widebody aircraft. Full-scale development is expected to begin in 2016, with the plane scheduled to enter into service around 2025.If successful, this will target the market dominated by the Airbus A330 and A350 and Boeing 787.China is also developing the Comac C919, a narrowbody jet that it hopes will break into the market dominated by the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737.

188,"  * Over 70 pct of top firms seeing improvement in Europe* Renault, L'Oreal among the most bullish* QE, lower oil price seen adding to momentum* Analyst says investors yet to factor in Europe's upturnBy Tom Bergin and Blaise RobinsonLONDON/PARIS, Feb 23 Signs of a long-awaited recovery in Europe are starting to show through in the profits of leading global companies, even if their bosses are still giving most of the credit to strong demand in Asia or the United States.Reuters has analysed comments from more than 50 of the biggest companies selling in Europe, which in recent weeks have mostly reported improving global earnings. In investor presentations and analyst calls, 71 percent said they enjoyed a swing from contraction to growth in Europe last year, or experienced a pickup in growth.Only 16 percent said European performance deteriorated in 2014 or that they expected declines in 2015. Thirteen percent said they saw stagnant markets for their goods and services in the region this year.""European markets recovered beyond our expectations,"" Carlos Ghosn, CEO of Renault SA, told investors earlier this month, saying the continent was the main driver of the carmaker's increased sales.Executives said they expected the positive momentum to be sustained through the year, as lower oil prices feed through into consumer's pockets and the European Central Bank prints new money to buy government bonds.Analysts say investors haven't fully factored in the extent to which the European Union - whose year-on-year GDP growth of just 1.3 percent in the last quarter of 2014 was around half the U.S. level -- has begun to turn the corner.""It's something that is still below the radar of global investors who have deserted Europe during the last few years and remain sceptical about the earnings trend in Europe,"" said Benoit Peloille, equity strategist at French corporate and investment bank Natixis.""There is improvement in the macro landscape in Europe, and companies are starting to benefit from it,"" he added. Northern European countries like Britain and Germany were typically cited as the strongest markets, but many companies said a recovery in southern Europe was tipping the continent into positive territory.L'Oreal Finance Director Christian Mulliez said that in Europe, the cosmetics group had seen ""the strongest growth since 2007, thanks mainly to the turnaround in Southern Europe"". The company said Spain, Portugal and Greece had displayed good growth, while other firms also cited recovery in Italy.In their earnings reports for the fourth quarter of 2014, 58 percent of members of the STOXX 600 index of leading European companies said their profits had increased, although that data also reflects their operations outside Europe.Overall, fourth-quarter earnings are expected to grow by 19.5 percent, which would be Europe's best earnings season in 3-1/2 years. European equities saw their largest ever inflows last week, totalling $5.8 billion.WEAK CURRENCY HELPS Stronger demand was the key driver of improved performance in Europe, executives said. This, and the tough cost-cutting introduced in recent years to tackle the soft economy, allowed many companies to boost margins, even against a deflationary backdrop. ""List price increases are difficult to accomplish. But you saw in Europe a terrific margin expansion this year,"" Ian Cook, chief executive of Colgate-Palmolive Co., told investors last month, citing efficiency programmes the company had pursued.Europe's weak GDP growth, sluggish inflation and the quantitative easing programme that the ECB has introduced to  address them have helped send the euro down to 11-year lows this year and some analysts predict it could hit parity with the dollar.That has weighed on the dollar value of European corporate profits and made products manufactured in the United States more expensive in euros.But on the ground in Europe, the impact is often positive. Steelmaker ArcelorMittal said the weaker euro was making it harder for peers outside Europe to compete here.Illinois-based construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar said it expected to face challenges selling diggers into Europe. But it also has a French manufacturing unit and ""a euro at parity will just be a great tailwind for that"", CEO Doug Oberhelman said.European manufacturers Daimler, ABB and Alstom said they expected their exports to be boosted by the weaker euro. Their increased competitiveness could also prove lucrative for their overseas suppliers: Minnesota-based 3M , which has a large business selling to European industrial and healthcare companies, predicted gains. ""As exports will increase as we go, I think that will help 3M as we go ahead,"" CEO Inge Thulin told investors.STILL CAUTIOUS Many companies reported weakness in their Russia and Ukraine markets that they didn't expect to improve as long as hostilities in Ukraine continue and sanctions against Russia persist. The health of France's economy was also a recurring worry.Yet only three companies expressed any concerns that Greece, which has been locked in tense negotiations with lenders about extending its bailout programme, could cause economic contagion across Europe.Some analysts say Greece, which was presenting economic reform plans on Monday to seal a euro zone financial lifeline, could yet be forced out of the single currency.Nonetheless, even among the companies which highlighted Greek risk, U.S. industrial group United Technologies Corporation said it thought any negative impact from Greece would be outweighed by the effects of QE and lower oil prices.Despite the overwhelming optimism around Europe, it was frequently guarded. And in a sign that the recovery is still far from robust, some companies said the growth they experienced was driven by the value end of the market.Among hotel groups, Hilton and Marriott said positive European performances were helped by expansion of limited-service brands like the former's DoubleTree and the latter's Courtyard and Residence Inn.Mark Hoplamazian, CEO of Hyatt Hotels Corporation, which offers almost exclusively full-service hotels in Europe, said ""continental Europe continues to struggle"".Paul Polman, CEO of consumer goods group Unilever PLC , which experienced a contracting market in Europe as consumers opted for discounted and unbranded goods, said the European consumer had fundamentally changed.""After several years of austerity measures, a mindset of economizing and making-do has become ingrained,"" he said.

Sikorsky, which makes both commercial and military aircraft, has a joint venture with a unit of Abu Dhabi state fund Mubadala  and Lockheed Martin in Abu Dhabi for aircraft maintenance. Sikorsky plans to open a regional office in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, and is opening a new business unit in Saudi Arabia to support military and commercial aircraft, Stanley said.

191,"  (Adds comments by Sikorsky executive, details on talks)WASHINGTON, March 2 United Technologies Corp's  Sikorsky Aircraft said on Monday it was in discussions with the U.S. Army about servicing its UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters under a performance-based logistics agreement, and could reach a contract deal in 2016.Sikorsky said it was still working out details, but any deal with the Army would likely include more government-handed depot maintenance than the $2 billion deal that Sikorsky and Lockheed Martin Corp were awarded on Friday by the U.S. Navy for servicing its MH-60 Sea Hawk helicopters. ""We're very close at this point to getting something in place on the Black Hawk,"" George Mitchell, vice president of aircraft and support for Sikorsky Aircraft's Defense Systems and Services division, told reporters on a conference call.Mitchell said the talks with the Army were still in the early stages, but he was upbeat about prospects for a deal given the expected cost savings and increased reliability. He said the talks were under way between Sikorsky and the Army, but depending on the scope of a possible deal, it could be handled by the Sikorsky-Lockheed joint venture that is conducting the maintenance work for the Navy. Industry officials say an agreement for servicing the Black Hawks would be a boon for Sikorsky given the larger number of such helicopters operated by the Army.Rod Skotty, president of the Sikorsky-Lockheed venture, said the Navy deal announced on Friday was the third performance-based logistics contract signed for the Sea Hawks since 2004. He said it increased the number of helicopters to be serviced from 330 to 530, and included more than 1,700 parts, up from 1,266 under the previous contract.

Thomson One users can register at RT/DAY/US. All times in ET/GMT)  Discount retailer Dollar General Corp reports fourth-quarter results. The company recently lost out on its bid for Family Dollar to smaller rival Dollar Tree. Analysts expect Dollar General to make smaller acquisitions and accelerate its store rollout in an attempt to compete more aggressively. Investors will look for comments on increasing private label offerings, expense reduction efforts, global sourcing initiatives and shrink management to support margins.      The Congressional Budget Office releases its analysis of President Barack Obama's fiscal 2016 budget proposal, showing how much his tax and spending proposals would increase or decrease U.S. deficits compared to current-law estimates. The forecasts will feed into a contentious budget debate in Washington as Republicans, who now fully control Congress, try to push through spending cuts to federal benefits programs and shift more resources to the military. Obama, a Democrat, has proposed significant spending increases on education and infrastructure, financed largely by tax increases on the wealthy.      The U.S. Commerce Department releases the retail sales report for February. The gauge of consumer spending is expected to have increased 0.3 percent after a 0.8 percent decline in January. (0830/1330) Separately, analysts expect initial claims for state unemployment benefits to fall to a seasonally adjusted 305,000 for the week in comparison to the prior week's 320,000. (0830/1330)      Shares of cement company Summit Materials Inc, controlled by Blackstone Group LP, are expected to start trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The initial public offering is expected to be priced at $17-$19 per share, valuing the company at about $1.8 billion at the high end of the range. The offering of 22.2 million shares is expected to raise up to $422.2 million. Summit Materials supplies aggregates and produces cement, ready-mixed concrete and asphalt paving mix. Blackstone's voting power will fall to 59.5 percent from 79.5 percent after the offering.      Penn West Petroleum Ltd reports fourth-quarter results. The company has struggled to cut costs and sell off assets as it seeks to survive the fall in oil prices.      Struggling teen apparel retailer Aeropostale Inc is expected to report fourth-quarter revenue above the average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. The retailer said last month that it might return to profit after two years of losses due to higher traffic, better margins and lower costs during the holiday shopping season. To fight a persistent slump in sales, Aeropostale has begun offering newer styles in dresses, tops and jeans, and has lowered price points and is controlling inventory to be able to discount less. Investors will look for comments on strategy and the company's initial forecast for 2015.      JA Solar Holdings Co is expected to report a higher fourth-quarter profit, helped by strong demand for panels, mainly from China. The Chinese solar panel maker said last year that it would set up plants in North America, among other regions, to avoid U.S. trade duties. Investors will want details about the plan and how the company will be affected by slowing growth in Japan.      Media company Walt Disney Co holds its annual meeting of shareholders. Investors will vote on whether to separate the chairman and CEO position held by Bob Iger. The move has failed in previous attempts.       United Technologies Corp hosts its annual meeting for investors in New York, the first broad business review led by CEO Greg Hayes since he was elevated from finance chief to the top job in November. Hayes has shaken up his top management ranks and spoken of becoming more aggressive in seeking deals. Wall Street is keen to see whether the new chief will reshape the U.S. conglomerate's portfolio of businesses that serve the aerospace and commercial building industries.      Bank of Canada official Rhys Mendes will testify to the House of Commons finance committee on the impact of oil prices on the economy. Mendes, deputy chief of the Canadian Economic Analysis Department at the central bank, will be one of five different panelists appearing at the committee's request. It is part of a series of meetings on the impact of cheap oil. The central bank's view on how serious an impact the plunge in oil prices will have is critical to gauging where it will head on monetary policy.      Statistics Canada releases fourth-quarter capacity utilization rate. Analysts expect the rate to be marginally higher at 83.6 percent after rising 83.4 percent in the third quarter. (0830/1330) Meanwhile, Canada's new housing price index is expected to have risen 0.1 percent in January. (0830/1330)      Brazil's central bank will publish the minutes of its last rate-setting meeting, providing markets some clues on whether officials will keep the aggressive pace of rate hikes or ease the cycle to avoid a deeper economic recession. A sharply weaker local currency is increasing inflationary pressures, raising the stakes for the central bank that has promised to bring inflation to 4.5 percent by late 2016.

220,"  (Adds events for Verizon, AT&T, Canadian National Railway and Rogers Communications)Week AheadA slew of Dow 30 companies report results in the week: Chemicals conglomerate DuPont, industrial conglomerate United Technologies Corp, property and casualty insurer Travelers Companies Inc and wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc on Tuesday; McDonald's Corp, AT&T Inc, Boeing Co and Coca-Cola Co on Wednesday; and diversified manufacturer 3M Co, Procter & Gamble and Microsoft Corp on Thursday. While DuPont is expected to report lower first-quarter results, Travelers Companies Inc's first-quarter results are expected to be in line with estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Investors will keep an eye out for details on Verizon's upcoming mobile video service and capital expenditure range and will look for updates on AT&T's proposed $48.5 billion deal to buy DirectTV, which is under regulatory review. Boeing faces fears of an aircraft downturn after it booked record orders in 2014, while Steve Easterbrook, McDonald's new CEO, is charged with reviving the company's falling sales and managing negative PR around the healthiness of its food. Investors will be watching the impact of the strong dollar on 3M's first-quarter results and Microsoft is expected to report sharply lower profit for its third quarter as sales of personal computers remain soggy.Search engine giant Google Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue slightly below analysts' estimate on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Google, which has been officially charged of cheating consumers and competitors by the European Union, is also being investigated for its Android mobile operating system. Analysts say the latter could prove a bigger threat to Google's future profitability. Analysts expect foreign exchange to negatively impact revenues in the first quarter even as paid click growth is poised to decelerate again.Facebook Inc is expected to post a first-quarter profit above Wall Street's expectations on Wednesday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The world's largest social network's business has been booming thanks to its mobile ads on smartphones and tablets. Many investors also expect that video ads will provide the company's next leg of growth. Facebook has also been stepping up efforts to expand products like messaging service WhatsApp and photo-sharing service Instagram. Investors will be looking out for the company's outlook for the remainder of 2015.On Thursday, the e-commerce company Amazon.com Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue largely in line with analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. However, analysts are expecting margins to improve as the company gets a grip on a slew of investments on everything from Hollywood-style television productions to cloud computing and consumer devices.On Tuesday, Yahoo Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue in line with analysts' estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, as its overall share of U.S. desktop searches declines.

Analysts are expecting 96 cents per share, up sharply from a year before.On Wednesday, chipmaker Qualcomm Inc is likely to report second-quarter revenue and profit broadly in line with analysts' average estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Qualcomm lowered its outlook for fiscal 2015 in January, saying it did not expect its newest Snapdragon mobile chip to be used in a major customer's flagship smartphone. Samsung opted for its own mobile processor and modem chip in the Galaxy S6 instead of equivalents from Qualcomm. The chipmaker had also warned that ""challenges"" with another of its chips had hurt its competitiveness in China. Qualcomm recently came under pressure from hedge fund Jana Partners to spin off its chip business from its patent-licensing business.Credit Suisse reports earnings for the first three months of 2015 on Tuesday. Meanwhile, on Friday the Swiss bank will ask shareholders to sign off in a symbolic vote on executive pay for 2014, when Credit Suisse became the largest bank in decades to plead guilty to a U.S. criminal charge and will pay more than $2.5 billion in penalties for helping Americans evade taxes.Investors will focus on existing home sales on Wednesday, which is expected to have increased 3.0 percent to an annual rate of 5.05 million units. Also, data for new home sales is expected to be released on Thursday. On Friday, the U.S. Commerce Department releases data for durable goods.Starbucks Corp reports its second-quarter results on Thursday. Starbucks is one of the restaurant industry's top performers, but investors and analysts worry that its streak of red-hot growth is coming to an end. The company has a variety of plans in place to boost sales (adding booze, smoothies, more lunch and dinner options, improving and expanding tea selections and testing delivery) and investors will be looking for proof that those are working.On Tuesday, Yum Brands Inc will report its first-quarter results. Yum's China business remains in the spotlight as it fights to recover from the latest food scandal in its biggest market. Analysts say the company is suffering from ""brand fatigue"" in China, where competition is mounting and its image has been hurt by food scares that have raised doubts over its supply chain.Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc is slated to announce results for the first quarter on Tuesday. Chipotle is still having problems finding pork suppliers to replace the one it suspended for running afoul of its animal welfare rules. The company says customers have simply switched to other meats and that it isn't losing sales - but investors will be on alert for any signs of a slowdown.Drugmaker Biogen Inc is expected to report a higher first-quarter profit on Friday, driven by strong sales of its top-selling oral MS drug, Tecfidera, which has seen burgeoning sales since its launch in 2013. Biogen, which leads the United States multiple sclerosis market with five drugs for the condition, recently reported promising data for its Alzheimer's drug. Investors will also be looking for commentary on Tecfider's growth expectations, and potential for competition, as well as the longer-acting MS injectable Plegridy.AbbVie Inc, whose planned $21 billion acquisition of Pharmacyclics Inc is meant to lessen the company's dependence on its blockbuster Humira arthritis drug, is expected to report sharply higher earnings and sales for the first quarter on Thursday, fueled by Humira's continuing growth and sales of the company's recently approved Viekira Pak treatment for hepatitis C. Investors will be keen for details on sales prospects for Viekira Pak, given steep price discounts AbbVie has given to compete with Gilead Science Inc's potent treatments for the liver disease.Eli Lilly and Co is expected to report higher first-quarter earnings on Thursday as the Indianapolis drugmaker begins to recover from patent expirations that slashed demand for its biggest products. The company is well positioned to deliver a promised return to profit growth this year, helped by new treatments for cancer and diabetes and growing sales of its animal health brands.Abbott Laboratories will report its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday. Recovering sales of Abbott Laboratories' infant formulas, following costly recalls in Asia, and improving performance of the company's branded generic medicines, are expected to drive quarterly earnings growth despite the negative impact of the stronger dollar.Ebay Inc is expected to report results for the first quarter largely in line with Wall Street expectations on Wednesday. The company has seen strong growth in payments business as well as its non-auction e-commerce business. Analysts expect that the company will continue to benefit from the rise in demand for mobile devices, as consumers increasingly use their smart phones and tablets to shop online. Investors will look for details on the company's plans for the spinoff of PayPal scheduled for the second half of 2015.On Thursday, Dow Chemical Co is expected to report a lower first-quarter profit due to a stronger dollar and a slowdown in its agricultural business. The company last month said it would offload a bulk of its low-margin bleach and vinyl-related business to Olin in a $5 billion. Investors will be looking for further comments on the company's cost-saving plans. Johnson Controls Inc, the auto parts supplier and maker of climate control systems for buildings, is expected to report higher second-quarter profit on Thursday, driven by higher sales in its seating and interiors business as auto sales and production rose in the first quarter. The company's buildings efficiency business, which provides air conditioning equipment and building management services, is also expected to report higher revenue as U.S. office vacancy rate declined to its lowest level since the third quarter to 2009. Investors will be looking for comments on Johnson Controls' business focus and outlook following the sale of its workplace solutions business to CBRE Group.Pentagon's No. 1 arms supplier, Lockheed Martin Corp, reports first-quarter results on Tuesday. Lockheed Martin has been focusing on increasing sales to commercial customers in United States as well as international governments to make up for pressures from tight U.S. defense spending. Lockheed gets 17 percent of its revenue from international markets and 1 percent from U.S. commercial customers. Investors will be looking to see if Lockheed still expects U.S. military spending to meaningfully pick up this year.Weapons maker Raytheon Co has increased exposure to international markets, which account for about 27 percent of its total sales, as U.S. defense spending remains tight. The maker of the Tomahawk missile and the Patriot missile defense system forecast disappointing 2015 revenue in January as domestic orders remained weak. When the company will report its first-quarter results on Thursday, investors will be looking for an update on a $2 billion order for the Patriot missile defense system that Raytheon expected to win in the first quarter.On Tuesday, Omnicom Group Inc, the No. 1 U.S. advertising company, is expected to report first-quarter results largely in-line with analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Omnicom had warned that a strong dollar would hit revenue this year. Omnicom, whose clients include Apple, McDonald's and Adidas, gets a little less than half of its revenue from outside the United States. On Friday, Interpublic Group of Companies Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue in line with analysts' average estimate according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company's previous quarter was helped by higher ad spending by businesses in the United States.On Tuesday, chipmaker Broadcom Corp is expected to report first-quarter revenue in line with analysts' estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Analysts expect the company's connectivity business to sequentially decline as it comes off a strong Apple-driven fourth quarter. Analysts will be looking for the company to provide outlook for the quarter ending June.On Wednesday, data storage company EMC Corp is expected to report first-quarter profit and revenue below analysts' estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company had in January forecast a lower-than-expected profit for 2015 and said it would cut jobs. The company, which earns nearly half of its revenue from international markets, is expected to be hurt by a strong dollar. Analysts say enterprise storage demand has been mixed in quarter which may hurt EMC.Virtualization software maker VMware Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue slightly below analysts' estimate on Tuesday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, hurt by a stronger dollar. More than 48 percent of VMware's revenue comes from outside the United States.

Coming on the heels of larger peer D.R. Horton's second-quarter results on Wednesday, PulteGroup's results are expected to provide further evidence of a strong spring selling season this year, suggesting that a slowdown in housing starts in the first three months did not point to underlying weakness in the U.S. housing market.Steelmaker Nucor Corp will report first-quarter results on Thursday. Nucor has been struggling with lower selling prices due to high levels of imports. Declining oil prices have also led to excess inventory in Nucor's pipe and tube business. Analysts will be looking for comments on inventory, steel demand and overcapacity in its steel mills business. On Thursday, Patterson-UTI Energy Inc, the second-largest land driller in North America, is expected to report a lower first-quarter profit as weak oil prices weigh on drilling activity. Patterson, which halved its rig construction program for this year, had warned that 2015 would be ""challenging,"" having received indications that customers could terminate a number of longer-term contracts early. Investors will be looking for updates on further cost saving measures and commentary on contracts and dayrates for its 16 new high-tech Apex rigs, which analysts believe could help the driller boost cash margins this year.Contract driller Nabors Industries Ltd, which is merging with C&J Energy, is expected to report on Tuesday a lower profit in the first quarter as drilling activity continues to be hurt by the fall in oil prices. The company has already warned of weak activity and pricing pressure in its international operations. Investors will be looking for updates on any job cuts and the company's plans to idle rigs in an oversupplied market.On Tuesday, coal miner Arch Coal Inc is expected to report a ninth straight quarterly loss and on Thursday, coal miner Peabody Energy Corp is expected to report a wider first-quarter loss due to continued weakness in coal prices.Kimberly-Clark Corp, the maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies diapers, is expected to report better-than-expected first-quarter sales, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, helped by growing demand in emerging markets such as Brazil, China and South Africa. However, higher input costs and a stronger dollar could have hurt profit. The company said in February it would transfer pension obligations to two insurers to reduce risk and will take a charge in the second quarter. It had also warned of an 8-9 percent drop in 2015 sales hurt by the dollar and weak demand for core products such as Huggies diapers. Investors will be looking for any updates on forecast on Tuesday.Hershey Co, the maker of Hershey's Kisses and Reese's peanut butter cups, has been struggling with high cocoa and dairy costs and intense competition from rivals such as Mondelez and Mars. To tackle growing competition, the company has been pouring money in advertisements and promotions, but this is expected to hurt its full-year earnings per share by 2 percentage points. It has also tried to diversify and add a new stream of revenue by acquiring jerky maker Krave Pure Foods Inc in January, marking its first foray into meat snacks. When the company will report its first-quarter profit on Thursday, investors will be looking out for comments on whether the company will make more acquisitions in the meat and bakery snacks category, which are becoming more popular than candy, and the effect of the strong dollar on its outlook.Dunkin' Brands Group Inc will report its first-quarter results on Thursday. Investors will be looking at how much Boston's record snowfall hurt results at Dunkin Brands, whose Dunkin' Donuts shops are concentrated in the U.S. northeast. Experts say the impact could be meaningful.Under Armour Inc, a sports apparel and footwear maker, is expected to report profit and sales for the first quarter in line with analysts' estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Analysts expect Under Armour to continue its 19-quarter streak of reporting more than 20 percent growth in revenue, helped by expanded offerings in sport and outdoor clothing, strong demand for its Speedform Apollo running shoes, new launches in basketball footwear and sponsorship deals. The company is also expected to benefit from investments in its fast-growing digital platform and from the acquisitions of fitness tracking apps Endomondo and MyFitnessPal. When the company will report on Tuesday, investors will look for an update to the full-year forecast and color on the performance of new launches in footwear.Hanesbrands Inc, the innerwear and apparel maker is expected to report first-quarter profit and sales above analysts' estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Analysts are projecting first-quarter sales growth of more than 15 percent as the company benefits from higher sales of sport and gym clothing at department stores, and the acquisition of DBApparel and Maidenform Brands. When the company reports on Thursday, investors will look for an update to the full-year forecast and more color on the company's recent acquisition of college logo clothing maker Knights Apparel.Ingersoll-Rand Plc, the maker of Trane air conditioners and Thermo King refrigeration units, is expected to report a higher first-quarter profit on Thursday, driven by growth in global industrial and construction markets.

Investors will also be looking for an update on how much the weakness in oil prices has hurt the company's newly acquired centrifugal compression business.Xerox Corp, which has been shifting its focus to IT services from making printers and copiers, is expected to report first-quarter revenue that is slightly below analysts' estimate on Friday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Xerox had cut its profit forecast for 2015 for the second time after reporting its sixth-consecutive drop in revenue last quarter. In December, the company agreed to sell its IT outsourcing arm to Atos. Teck Resources Ltd, Canada's largest diversified miner, is expected to report on Tuesday a lower profit in the first quarter as prices for both copper and steel-making coal remain depressed amid a fall in demand.

229,"   By Jeffrey Dastin  United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N) on Wednesday announced plans to lease up to 25 used aircraft from AerCap Holdings NV, one of the world's largest aircraft lessors (AER.N), to reduce its dependence on smaller, 50-seat jets.The Chicago-based airline said it expects delivery of 11 used Airbus Group NV (AIR.PA) A319 aircraft over the next two years, with the right to add up to 14 more of the single-isle planes over the next five years, subject to certain conditions.The additions are part of a broader fleet reorganization United unveiled last month that aims to match bigger planes with markets of growing demand, without increasing its spending or capacity forecasts. Integral to the plan is removing 50-seat jets flown by United's regional contractors, which can waste more fuel per passenger than larger planes. The carrier said it will take 130 of these aircraft off its schedule by the end of 2015, with more cuts to come later.As an example, United said it now might fly two A319s, which have more than 120 seats, on a route that currently operates with three 70-seat jets. It then could use those 70-seaters on routes in which it currently uses the 50-seat planes. ""Our flexible fleet plan allows us to opportunistically add used aircraft when the economics are attractive,"" United's Fleet Vice President Ron Baur said in a statement.Cheap fuel prices, down more than 40 percent since June, have made it increasingly affordable to fly old, less fuel-efficient jets. China Southern Airlines Co Ltd (600029.SS) currently operates the A319s that United will lease, with first deliveries starting in early 2016.United said it will add new seats, overhead-bin extensions and Wi-Fi to the planes, and it will perform checks so they align with its maintenance program.United said last month that the lease of 10 to 20 used narrowbody aircraft would not alter its forecast for yearly capital expenditures of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion over the next three to four years.

242,"   By Andrea Shalal | PARIS  PARIS Eileen Drake, the new chief executive of Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc (AJRD.N), on Sunday vowed to keep a ""huge focus"" on cutting overhead costs in coming years, including a 10-percent workforce reduction and possible facility closings.Drake, a former Army helicopter pilot and executive with Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), joined Aerojet Rocketdyne in March as its chief operating officer, just three days before the company announced a major cost-reduction drive and changed its name from GenCorp Inc.She took over as CEO on June 1, when Scott Seymour retired for health reasons. Seymour had taken over the helm of the Aerojet Rocketdyne unit in February when its president, Warren Boley, was pushed out amid differences over corporate plans. On Sunday, in her first interview since becoming CEO, Drake sought to downplay any concerns about changes and highlighted the company's strong foundation, solid backlog and committed workforce. But she said it needed to squeeze more synergies out of the 2013 acquisition of Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne.""We have to be sure that we really work as one company,"" Drake said, citing what she called opportunities to eliminate redundant organizations across the company. Drake said she would continue a program kicked off in March to make the company's products more affordable. Initially, it calls for a 1 million square foot (93,000 sq meter) reduction in facilities in Sacramento, where the company is headquartered, and a 10-percent cut in the 5,000-person workforce over the next four years.Before coming to the Paris Airshow, Drake has been visiting Aerojet Rocketdyne's 14 facilities in 11 states. She vowed to evaluate carefully how each of those sites was being used, and whether further facility consolidations were possible. Aerojet Rocketdyne is also keeping close tabs on an investigation into the Oct. 28 explosion of an Aerojet-powered  Orbital ATK (OA.N) rocket, a report that has been delayed for months.Orbital and Aerojet Rocketdyne, which refurbished a Soviet-era engine to power Orbital's Antares rocket, are at odds over the root cause of the explosion. Orbital rejects Aerojet's claim that the mishap was caused by debris in the rocket's fuel tank.A report prepared by Orbital under the oversight of the Federal Aviation Administration is expected in coming weeks. The company plans to bid for U.S. Air Force funds to continue its work on a new U.S. rocket engine called AR-1. The company said it remained in dialogue with United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Boeing Co (BA.N) and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) about using that new engine to replace the Russian-built RD-180 engine that now powers ULA's Atlas 5 rocket. The U.S. Congress passed a law last year that bans use of the Russian engines for military and spy satellite launches after 2019.Aerojet Rocketdyne has joined with several other players to ask the Pentagon to investigate obtaining the data rights to the rocket, but ULA has said it does not plan to sell the rights.

243,"   By Andrea Shalal | PARIS  PARIS United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) said on Monday it was exiting the helicopter business and would decide by the end of the third quarter whether to spin off or sell its $8 billion Sikorsky Aircraft unit, the U.S. military's largest helicopter maker.United Technologies said the decision to shed the 90-plus year-old Sikorsky unit, which generates lower margins than other United Tech units, came after a review of strategic alternatives announced earlier this year and was subject to final board approval. United Tech shares were trading 2.5 percent lower at $114.60 around mid-afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.United Tech Chief Executive Gregory Hayes said Sikorsky was well positioned for long-term growth and separating it from the portfolio would allow both Sikorsky and the parent company to better focus on their core businesses.""Whether we sell it or whether we spin it, the future will be bright for Sikorsky,"" Hayes said. The board met last week to discuss its options after receiving a number of offers for Sikorsky, including one that would combine the company with the Bell Helicopter unit of Textron Inc (TXT.N), Reuters reported last week.Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) and Boeing Co (BA.N) have also expressed interest in a potential deal.Bob Leduc, president of Sikorsky Aircraft, told Reuters in his first media interview that he remained confident about the company's longer-term outlook, despite a sharp downturn in the commercial market and the pending sell or spin decision. Leduc, a long-time United Tech executive, said he could not refuse Hayes' request that he return from retirement to head Sikorsky. ""From my perspective, Sikorsky is a national treasure. That opportunity doesn't come along very often,"" he said.Any successful bidder would likely have to pay a premium given the steep tax bill facing the parent company, Leduc said.   He said the current downturn in the commercial market was expected to last 18 to 24 months, with dropping oil prices driving demand from the oil and gas sector sharply lower. Earlier, Leduc told an investor conference the company expected to boost revenues to at least $10 billion by 2025 based on its backlog of $49 billion, largely in U.S. military orders, which account for about 70 percent of the company's business. Leduc said there was ""upside"" on top of that revenue forecast, depending on developments in new helicopter programs.""We will be the last man standing,"" Leduc told Reuters. He said the company would be strengthened by a recent restructuring and efforts to improve the company's risk management and discipline on new development programs, regardless of whether it was eventually sold or spun off as a standalone company.The company's development of autonomous flight control systems could help it reduce the weight of helicopters in coming years, lowering costs, and should help boost sales, Leduc said.

244,"  (Updates with comments from Sikorsky president, share price)By Andrea ShalalPARIS, June 15 United Technologies Corp  said on Monday it was exiting the helicopter business and would decide by the end of the third quarter whether to spin off or sell its $8 billion Sikorsky Aircraft unit, the U.S. military's largest helicopter maker.United Technologies said the decision to shed the 90-plus year-old Sikorsky unit, which generates lower margins than other United Tech units, came after a review of strategic alternatives announced earlier this year and was subject to final board approval. United Tech shares were trading 2.5 percent lower at $114.60 around mid-afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.United Tech Chief Executive Gregory Hayes said Sikorsky was well positioned for long-term growth and separating it from the portfolio would allow both Sikorsky and the parent company to better focus on their core businesses.""Whether we sell it or whether we spin it, the future will be bright for Sikorsky,"" Hayes said.The board met last week to discuss its options after receiving a number of offers for Sikorsky, including one that would combine the company with the Bell Helicopter unit of Textron Inc, Reuters reported last week.Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co have also expressed interest in a potential deal. Bob Leduc, president of Sikorsky Aircraft, told Reuters in his first media interview that he remained confident about the company's longer-term outlook, despite a sharp downturn in the commercial market and the pending sell or spin decision.Leduc, a long-time United Tech executive, said he could not refuse Hayes' request that he return from retirement to head Sikorsky. ""From my perspective, Sikorsky is a national treasure. That opportunity doesn't come along very often,"" he said.Any successful bidder would likely have to pay a premium given the steep tax bill facing the parent company, Leduc said. He said the current downturn in the commercial market was expected to last 18 to 24 months, with dropping oil prices driving demand from the oil and gas sector sharply lower.Earlier, Leduc told an investor conference the company expected to boost revenues to at least $10 billion by 2025 based on its backlog of $49 billion, largely in U.S. military orders, which account for about 70 percent of the company's business.Leduc said there was ""upside"" on top of that revenue forecast, depending on developments in new helicopter programs.""We will be the last man standing,"" Leduc told Reuters. He said the company would be strengthened by a recent restructuring and efforts to improve the company's risk management and discipline on new development programs, regardless of whether it was eventually sold or spun off as a standalone company. The company's development of autonomous flight control systems could help it reduce the weight of helicopters in coming years, lowering costs, and should help boost sales, Leduc said.

249,"   By Sarah Young | PARIS, June 15  PARIS, June 15 Russia's United Aircraft Corporation wants a new wide-body aircraft it is developing with a Chinese company to be flying by 2025, as part of an ambitious project to take on Western planemakers Airbus and Boeing Co.Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd and United Aircraft Corporation, both state-controlled companies, have been considering the joint development of a new advanced wide-body jet since May 2014.United Aircraft Corporation's new president Yury Slyusar, who took the reins in January, said the Russian and Chinese governments would from September be in a position to decide on whether to proceed with the project after it is presented that month.""We would like to develop, certify and produce the first aircraft within ten years, so by 2025 we should begin deliveries,"" Slyusar, speaking through a translator, told reporters at the Paris air show on Monday. The joint project could give both China and Russia a chance to compete in the wide-body segment which currently operates as a virtual duopoly under Europe's Airbus and U.S. rival Boeing.While Soviet Russia had developed wide-body technology some decades ago, Slyusar said this jet would be a new design. ""The aircraft has to be developed from scratch,"" he said.""The level of the Chinese industry that we're seeing leads us to believe that it will be a very innovative aircraft."" China is in the process of developing a home-grown narrow-body commercial jet, the Comac C919, but it is behind schedule and delivery could be pushed back as much as two years, dealing a blow to any challenge to Airbus and Boeing in smaller planes.Slyusar acknowledged the plan to compete in wide-bodies was a high stakes game. ""It will determine the level of competitiveness of both Russia and China's aviation industries,"" he said.The engine for any new wide-bodied jet would likely be sourced from either U.S. aero-engine maker GE or Britain's Rolls-Royce, Slyusar added.""We're not commenting if we're speaking with them or not because it's too early, the decision has not been made yet,"" a United Aircraft Corporation spokesman said on the sidelines of the press conference.

252,"   By Jeffrey Dastin and Diane Bartz | WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  WASHINGTON/NEW YORK The U.S. Department of Justice said on Wednesday it is investigating whether U.S. airlines worked together illegally to keep airfares high by signaling plans to limit flights.The Justice Department wrote to major U.S. air carriers demanding that they detail decisions to limit the number of seats they offer, and what they've said about those plans to investors, securities analysts and the public.Airlines contacted have been asked to provide “available seat miles on a regional and system wide basis” back to January 2010 and a raft of other data. The top four U.S. carriers American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), Delta Air Lines Inc  (DAL.N), United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N) and Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) control some 80 percent of the domestic air travel market.The four confirmed receipt of the regulator's letter and said they are cooperating fully with the investigation. News of the probe sent the Dow Jones U.S. airlines index .DJUSAR down 2 percent.    Shares of the U.S. carriers have gyrated in recent weeks as investors questioned whether they were planning to add capacity at a pace faster than overall economic growth, which could put  downward pressure on fares. Southwest fueled investor jitters about declining profit margins in May when it unveiled plans to boost capacity by as much as 8 percent this year from 2014, although it later revised the expected increase to 7 percent. But carriers have started taking flights off their fall schedules and postponing aircraft deliveries in response to Wall Street concerns that adding more flights and seats could erode fares and margins.    Mergers, new fees imposed on passengers and caution about adding capacity have boosted U.S. airline earnings after a decade of bankruptcies following the September 11, 2001 attacks. In the past year, tumbling oil prices have helped the carriers post billion-dollar profits.The probe focusing on whether the top U.S. carriers are colluding domestically comes as some of the same airlines complain that foreign rivals are competing unfairly on some overseas routes. U.S. carriers have asked the Obama administration to freeze access to U.S. airports by three Gulf airlines for allegedly receiving state subsidies. The Gulf airlines deny that they have received subsidies in violation of trade agreements.The U.S. airlines also have fought plans by low-cost Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA (NWC.OL) to expand its U.S. flights under an Irish subsidiary, with claims that it will undermine wages and working standards.Consumer advocates and some lawmakers praised the Justice department action focusing on domestic fares. ""This investigation must be tireless and timely to save consumers from the onslaught of price increases in summer fares,"" U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal said in a statement.The airlines and their defenders say ticket prices have fallen in 2015 while capacity this summer has reached a post-recession high.""Our members compete vigorously every day, and the traveling public has been the beneficiary,"" trade group Airlines for America said in a statement Wednesday.    Separately, Connecticut's attorney general sent letters to the four carriers last week asking whether they have coordinated prices, citing recent statements at an industry conference held last month in Miami.

253,"   By Andrea Shalal and Mike Stone | WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  WASHINGTON/NEW YORK Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) and Textron Inc (TXT.N) have emerged as final contenders to buy United Technologies Corp's  (UTX.N) Sikorsky Aircraft business, which could be valued at around $8 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.UTC is weighing offers from the two companies and may come to a decision by the end of the month, one of the people said. The company could still decide against an outright sale and instead spin off Sikorsky to shareholders in a tax-free deal, the people added, asking not to be named because the matter is not public.Last month, UTC announced it was exiting the helicopter business and would either sell or spin off Sikorsky, which has come under pressure in the commercial market, where lower energy prices have slashed demand from the oil and gas sector.Textron, which has a market capitalization of about $12 billion and is up against a much larger suitor, has reached out to private equity firms to put together a cash bid for Sikorsky, the people said. Lockheed Martin has a market value of about $60 billion. Textron, maker of Bell helicopters and Cessna aircraft, had initially proposed a Reverse Morris Trust (RMT) merger between Sikorsky and Textron, a transaction that allows a parent company to sell its subsidiary while avoiding a hefty tax bill, Reuters previously reported.UTC made clear it was not interested in acquiring a stake in Textron as part of the more complex transaction, the sources said. People familiar with the process had said that arrangement would have had substantial tax savings.Textron then reached out private equity firms for help to make a cash offer, the sources said. Boeing Co (BA.N), which had expressed interest in a potential deal, is no longer active in the sale process, the sources said. Airbus Group SE (AIR.PA), the world's largest civil helicopter maker which has said it is keeping an eye on the fate of Sikorsky, is not in the race to acquire it, another source familiar with the situation said.Representatives for UTC, Lockheed, Textron, Boeing and Airbus declined comment.Analysts have focused on Textron as the likeliest buyer, given its interest in beefing up its existing Bell Helicopter business. But industry executives said there could be antitrust questions on the commercial side, given that both companies make helicopters in similar market segments. For Lockheed, acquiring Sikorsky would be the first major acquisition for Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson, who has helped nearly double the company's share price since taking over as CEO in January 2013.Sikorsky is seen as a ""signature company"" that could help Lockheed produce strong revenues in the medium term, when production of the F-35 fighter jet program begins to taper off, said one of the sources. ""It would certainly help Lockheed diversify its portfolio,"" said one of the sources.Lockheed and Sikorsky already work together on several major helicopter programs, including the presidential helicopter, a combat rescue helicopter and the MH-60R- and S-model helicopters built for the Navy and Marine Corps.

254,"  United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N) said on Thursday its pretax profit margin for the second quarter will be in the lower range of its earlier outlook and said the strong U.S. dollar has hurt demand from travelers abroad.The Chicago-based airline said it expects a pretax margin of 12 to 13 percent for the quarter ended June 30. Its prior forecast was for a pretax margin of 12 to 14 percent.It said its quarterly capacity grew some 2.3 percent from a year earlier, in the lower range of earlier guidance of 2.25 to 3.25 percent growth. Investors have called on U.S. airlines to taper their capacity growth to match weaker demand. United said it expects passenger revenue per available seat mile, which measures sales relative to the capacity and distance of flights, to have fallen between 5.25 percent and 5.75 percent year-over-year, within the range of the prior outlook.The carrier said it expects gross capital expenditures were higher than it previously forecast for the quarter because of a change in timing of aircraft-related deposits. It now expects to have spent between $1.24 billion and $1.26 billion, up from prior guidance of $885 million to $905 million. It said it had $5 billion in unrestricted cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter.

265,"   By Andrea Shalal and Lewis Krauskopf | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) has agreed to buy United Technologies Corp's (UTX.N) Sikorsky Aircraft for over $8 billion, two sources said on Sunday, cementing a deal that would confirm Lockheed's dominance in weapons making and giving the Black Hawk helicopter to the maker of the F-35 fighter jet.The deal will add further heft to Lockheed, which already has annual revenues of around $45 billion and dwarves its nearest competitors, the defense business of Boeing Co (BA.N) and Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N).It will make Lockheed less reliant on the $391 billion F-35 fighter jet business, while expanding its overseas sales by adding Sikorsky's iconic Black Hawk helicopters to a product line that already spans everything from satellites to naval ships.The two companies plan to announce the deal on Monday before both report second-quarter results on Tuesday, said the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly.It will be Lockheed's largest acquisition since it bought Martin Marietta Corp for about $10 billion two decades ago. It is the first major strategic move for both United Tech Chief Executive Officer Greg Hayes, who was elevated to CEO from finance chief in November, and Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson, who took her job in January 2013.United Technologies and Lockheed officials declined comment. Textron Inc (TXT.N), parent of Bell Helicopter, had submitted a bid for Sikorsky, but dropped out of the bidding after the price rose, according to several sources familiar with the matter. Both helicopter makers have seen revenues drop due to lower demand from the oil and gas sector.Pentagon officials last week said they would carefully evaluate any sale of Sikorsky, saying it was important to the department to maintain competition and avoid market distortions.The U.S. Defense Department can object to a merger involving its key suppliers during a federal antitrust review, which in this case could be led by the U.S. Justice Department. Industry executives do not expect antitrust objections since Lockheed does not build helicopters, but said U.S. officials could ask for certain written assurances given Lockheed's expanded scale.""It's a big deal, but it doesn't concentrate markets any further than they already were,"" said Virginia-based defense consultant Loren Thompson. ""There's no real overlap between the fighter market and the rotorcraft market. They're discrete markets with different customers and users.""Lockheed is also looking to shed some of its lower-margin services businesses, which could help lower revenues in coming months, according to several sources familiar with the matter.Industry executives have long predicted further consolidation in the U.S. defense market after a massive contraction in the 1990s after the Cold War. The only sector that had remained largely unscathed was the helicopter market. Boeing, which makes CH-47 Chinook helicopters and works with Bell on the V-22, has already teamed up with Sikorsky to develop a next-generation helicopter for the U.S. military. UTC in March said it would explore alternatives for Sikorsky, which accounted for $7.5 billion in sales last year out of total UTC revenues of $65 billion. In June, it said it would exit the helicopter business and sell or spin off Sikorsky, which expects slower revenue growth and has lower profit margins than other UTC divisions.Sikorsky's fit with United Tech, which also makes Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Otis elevators, had been long debated on Wall Street. Sikorsky's first-quarter operating profit dropped 11 percent on a 7 percent fall in sales. In June, the unit announced 1,400 job cuts and said it would consolidate facilities.The price of the acquisition was inflated by a huge tax bill facing UTC since Sikorsky's value has appreciated so much since it became part of United Tech in 1929.UTC could use the funds for other large acquisitions, although the CEO has said the high valuations of targets have made potential transactions expensive. Lockheed decided to proceed with the deal, despite the hefty price tag, because it views Sikorsky as a ""signature company"" that will ensure strong revenues in the medium term, when F-35 production begins to taper off, according to two of the sources.Lockheed and Sikorsky already work together on several major helicopter programs, including the presidential helicopter, a combat rescue helicopter and the MH-60R- and S-model helicopters built for the Navy and Marine Corps.Sikorsky's strong foreign sales would help Lockheed expand its international footprint, said Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst with the Virginia-based Teal Group.""It's a great business for them to own. In addition to the F-35 and the C-130J, Sikorsky is another great brand for them to underpin their defense strategy,"" he said.Lockheed is keen to preserve the Sikorsky brand, the sources said, which means the company may well allow Sikorsky to continue functioning as a standalone business instead of integrating it into its already huge Aeronautics division, which had revenues of over $14 billion last year.Other big aerospace companies, including Italy's Finmeccanica SpA, Europe's Airbus and Textron Inc, allow their helicopter businesses to operate as separate units.

266,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Lockheed Martin Corp said Monday it would buy Black Hawk maker Sikorsky Aircraft from United Technologies Corp for $9 billion, cementing Lockheed's dominance in weapons making.Lockheed will also review the possible sale or spin off of $6 billion in other information technology and services businesses.The Pentagon's largest supplier called Sikorsky a ""national icon"" and said the net cost of the deal was around $7.1 billion, taking into account tax benefits. Lockheed also reported higher earnings and revenue for the second quarter.The deal, first reported by Reuters on Sunday, also opens key foreign markets for Lockheed, which has annual revenues of $45 billion. It already dwarves its nearest competitors, the defense business of Boeing Co and Northrop Grumman Corp.It comes just months after UTC said it would explore alternatives for Sikorsky, which it has owned since 1929 and which accounted for $7.5 billion in sales last year out of total UTC revenues of $65 billion.   This is Lockheed's largest acquisition since it bought Loral Corp's defense electronics business for $9.1 billion in 1996, and its $10 billion merger with Martin Marietta in 1994.It marks the first major strategic move for both United Tech CEO Greg Hayes, who was elevated from finance chief in November, and Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson, who took her job in January 2013.The two sides wrapped up key aspects of the deal late last week before Hewson jetted off to an annual UK air show, the Royal International Air Tattoo. Hewson returned in time for a telephone board meeting on Sunday evening that endorsed the deal, according to sources familiar with the process. The news buoyed Lockheed shares close to February record highs set. Shares were up 1.8 percent at $204.78; United Tech shares were about 0.4 percent lower at $110.30.""Sikorsky is a natural fit for Lockheed Martin and complements our broad portfolio of world-class aerospace and defense products and technologies,"" Hewson told analysts on an earnings call. She said the deal would give Lockheed access to a $30 billion annual military and commercial rotorcraft market, and said Lockheed expected Sikorsky's commercial helicopter business to recover from an oil-price related slump in coming years.Lockheed, which makes F-35 fighter jets, naval ships and government satellites, said it would continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends and to reduce outstanding share count to below 300 million shares by the end of 2017.  Democratic Representative Rosa DeLauro, who represents the Connecticut district where Sikorsky is based, said company President Bob Leduc assured her early Monday that Sikorsky would retain collective bargaining agreement and keep its name. Sikorsky has about 15,000 workers around the world.Pentagon officials had no immediate comment on the deal. Last week, they said they would carefully evaluate any sale of Sikorsky, saying it was important to maintain competition and avoid market distortions.The U.S. Defense Department can object to a merger involving key suppliers during a federal antitrust review, which in this case could be led by the U.S. Justice Department.Hewson said Pentagon officials planned a detailed review, but she did not expect major obstacles. Hewson said the deal would not reduce the number of competitors in the helicopter business, and Lockheed's plans to sell or spin off $6 billion in other businesses meant the company's overall size would not grow substantially.""Between those two elements, it is very positive,"" Hewson told analysts when asked about the Pentagon's initial reaction.Lockheed, advised on the acquisition by Credit Suisse and Fried Frank, said expects to close the Sikorsky transaction by late in the fourth quarter or early in 2016.Lockheed said it would complete a strategic review of its government IT infrastructure services business and the technical services business within its missiles and fire control segment by the end of the year, potentially affecting about 17,000 employees.The company said it would retain services businesses focused on defense and intelligence customers, including its extensive cybersecurity work for the U.S. government.UTC said proceeds from the Sikorsky sale would fund more share buybacks. Its board authorized a share buyback of up to 75 million shares, worth about $8.3 billion based on Friday's closing price.

Analysts and industry executives said they expected major consolidation moves in the services segment in coming months, given Lockheed's announcement and moves by other companies.But the company's decision to buy Sikorsky is unlikely to trigger a new wave of consolidation among prime contractors in the weapons market, which was already whittled down to five major players after the end of the Cold War in the 1990s.Jeff Bialos, a former senior U.S. defense official and partner with Sutherland, Asbill & Brennan, said there was no sign that the Pentagon has changed its policy to discourage hook-ups among first-tier or big prime contractors. He said he expected the Defense Department to conduct a thorough review of the Lockheed-Sikorsky deal, which would look at both the scale of the company post-acquisition, conflicts of interest, and any adverse impact on suppliers or competitors.Lockheed's agreement with UTC shows the company is bracing for possible divestments, including up to $650 million in parts of its mission systems and training business, according to the sales agreement with UTC. Sikorsky's X2 helicopter technology was exempted from potential divestments.The contract also spells out Lockheed's agreement to accept certain ""behaviorial limitations, conduct restrictions or similar commitments"" if required to do so by the government.   Bialos said there would be input from other companies and that a second 30-day review period was likely under a U.S. Department of Justice antitrust process. The U.S. Defense Department can object to a merger involving suppliers during a federal antitrust review.Foreign governments and entities can also raise concerns, said one industry executive.Lockheed said it aims to complete the process by late 2015 or early 2016.

Jeff Bialos, a former senior U.S. defense official and partner with Sutherland, Asbill & Brennan, said there was no sign that the Pentagon has changed its policy to discourage hook-ups among first-tier or big prime contractors.He said he expected the Defense Department to conduct a thorough review of the Lockheed-Sikorsky deal, which would look at both the scale of the company post-acquisition, conflicts of interest, and any adverse impact on suppliers or competitors. Lockheed's agreement with UTC shows the company is bracing for possible divestments, including up to $650 million in parts of its mission systems and training business, according to the sales agreement with UTC. Sikorsky's X2 helicopter technology was exempted from potential divestments.The contract also spells out Lockheed's agreement to accept certain ""behaviorial limitations, conduct restrictions or similar commitments"" if required to do so by the government.Bialos said there would be input from other companies and that a second 30-day review period was likely under a U.S. Department of Justice antitrust process. The U.S. Defense Department can object to a merger involving suppliers during a federal antitrust review.Foreign governments and entities can also raise concerns, said one industry executive.Lockheed said it aims to complete the process by late 2015 or early 2016. Its agreement with UTC requires a deal to be reached within nine months, with a possible 120 day extension.

270,"   By Lewis Krauskopf  Now that United Technologies Corp Chief Executive Greg Hayes has closed a deal to sell the conglomerate's Sikorsky helicopter unit, he may become an acquirer in his own right.United Tech shares slipped 0.7 percent on Monday after news of the $9 billion sale to Lockheed Martin Inc became official.Even though analysts applauded the price, investors may have already incorporated the benefits from splitting off the lower-margin business, a move United Tech had been signaling for months. Also, United Tech, which reports earnings on Tuesday, will lose Sikorsky's profit contribution, estimated by Sterne Agee CRT at 6.5 percent of overall operating earnings this year. It plans to offset that decline by using the deal's proceeds to repurchase shares, thus bolstering earnings per share. It has authorized a buyback of some $8 billion. But Edward Jones analyst Matt Arnold said he believes that if the right acquisition comes along, United Tech could divert those funds from the buyback allocation.""There’s an asterisk on it,"" Arnold said.Hayes, who became CEO in November, has consistently said he wants to make acquisitions to boost the conglomerate's prospects. Without Sikorsky, United Tech is squarely focused in two areas: jet engines and other commercial aerospace systems and components; and elevators, climate control units and security systems for commercial buildings. Hayes has said he prefers large deals but that his ambitions have been undercut by high prices of potential targets.Even if United Tech uses the Sikorsky proceeds on buybacks, ""they still have balance sheet flexibility to pursue acquisitions,"" said Sterne Agee CRT analyst Peter Arment.Potential targets include electrical and lighting systems company Hubbell Inc, Dublin-based security firm Allegion and British aircraft parts supplier Meggitt, Credit Suisse analysts said in a research note on Monday. Some analysts said United Tech was more likely to use its cash held overseas for a foreign takeover, leaving the Sikorsky proceeds for buybacks.United Tech had $5.28 billion in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet as of March 31, according to its most recent such disclosure. More than 97 percent of its cash was held by foreign subsidiaries as of that date, the filing said.""If you think about markets starting to get better, Europe is one of those and that’s where an awful lot of that cash is,"" said Scott Lawson, vice president of investment management firm Westwood Holdings Group.

272,"  (Adds comments from analyst call, lawmaker)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON, July 20 Lockheed Martin Corp  said Monday it would buy Black Hawk maker Sikorsky Aircraft from United Technologies Corp for $9 billion, cementing Lockheed's dominance in weapons making.Lockheed will also review the possible sale or spin off of $6 billion in other information technology and services businesses.The Pentagon's largest supplier called Sikorsky a ""national icon"" and said the net cost of the deal was around $7.1 billion, taking into account tax benefits. Lockheed also reported higher earnings and revenue for the second quarter.The deal, first reported by Reuters on Sunday, also opens key foreign markets for Lockheed, which has annual revenues of $45 billion. It already dwarves its nearest competitors, the defense business of Boeing Co and Northrop Grumman Corp .It comes just months after UTC said it would explore alternatives for Sikorsky, which it has owned since 1929 and which accounted for $7.5 billion in sales last year out of total UTC revenues of $65 billion.This is Lockheed's largest acquisition since it bought Loral Corp's defense electronics business for $9.1 billion in 1996, and its $10 billion merger with Martin Marietta in 1994.It marks the first major strategic move for both United Tech CEO Greg Hayes, who was elevated from finance chief in November, and Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson, who took her job in January 2013. The two sides wrapped up key aspects of the deal late last week before Hewson jetted off to an annual UK air show, the Royal International Air Tattoo. Hewson returned in time for a telephone board meeting on Sunday evening that endorsed the deal, according to sources familiar with the process.The news buoyed Lockheed shares close to February record highs set. Shares were up 1.8 percent at $204.78; United Tech shares were about 0.4 percent lower at $110.30.""Sikorsky is a natural fit for Lockheed Martin and complements our broad portfolio of world-class aerospace and defense products and technologies,"" Hewson told analysts on an earnings call.She said the deal would give Lockheed access to a $30 billion annual military and commercial rotorcraft market, and said Lockheed expected Sikorsky's commercial helicopter business to recover from an oil-price related slump in coming years. Lockheed, which makes F-35 fighter jets, naval ships and government satellites, said it would continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends and to reduce outstanding share count to below 300 million shares by the end of 2017.Democratic Representative Rosa DeLauro, who represents the Connecticut district where Sikorsky is based, said company President Bob Leduc assured her early Monday that Sikorsky would retain collective bargaining agreement and keep its name. Sikorsky has about 15,000 workers around the world.Pentagon officials had no immediate comment on the deal. Last week, they said they would carefully evaluate any sale of Sikorsky, saying it was important to maintain competition and avoid market distortions. The U.S. Defense Department can object to a merger involving key suppliers during a federal antitrust review, which in this case could be led by the U.S. Justice Department.Hewson said Pentagon officials planned a detailed review, but she did not expect major obstacles.Hewson said the deal would not reduce the number of competitors in the helicopter business, and Lockheed's plans to sell or spin off $6 billion in other businesses meant the company's overall size would not grow substantially.""Between those two elements, it is very positive,"" Hewson told analysts when asked about the Pentagon's initial reaction.Lockheed, advised on the acquisition by Credit Suisse and Fried Frank, said expects to close the Sikorsky transaction by late in the fourth quarter or early in 2016.Lockheed said it would complete a strategic review of its government IT infrastructure services business and the technical services business within its missiles and fire control segment by the end of the year, potentially affecting about 17,000 employees.The company said it would retain services businesses focused on defense and intelligence customers, including its extensive cybersecurity work for the U.S. government.UTC said proceeds from the Sikorsky sale would fund more share buybacks. Its board authorized a share buyback of up to 75 million shares, worth about $8.3 billion based on Friday's closing price.

276,"   By Lewis Krauskopf  United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), which agreed on Monday to sell its Sikorsky helicopter business, cut its full-year profit outlook on Tuesday as it warned of pressures in its aerospace systems and Otis elevators businesses. United Tech, whose shares fell 4.1 percent after the company also reported second-quarter results, on Monday said it would sell its Sikorsky helicopter unit to Lockheed Martin Inc (LMT.N) for $9 billion, after saying in June it planned to exit the business following a strategic review.Excluding Sikorsky, United Tech now expects earnings from continuing operations in a range of $6.15 to $6.30 per share this year, down from the prior range of $6.35 to $6.55 per share. The company said the commercial aftermarket for its UTC Aerospace Systems business will be ""significantly below"" expectations. United Tech has been hurt as airlines have provisioned fewer replacement parts than expected for new aircraft for their maintenance stations, Chief Executive Greg Hayes said in an interview. The company, which already twice this year had trimmed its 2015 outlook, also cited struggles for its Otis elevators business in Europe and China.""It’s a big take down and nobody is happy about it,"" Hayes said in an interview. ""I thought we had to just be realistic in terms of the second half.""With the fate of Sikorsky settled, Hayes said the company was ready to turn its focus to acquisitions, and was ""looking at everything from $500 million to $5 billion."" ""We’re done shrinking UTC with the completion of this divestiture,"" Hayes said.The U.S conglomerate said that second-quarter net income fell to $1.54 billion, or $1.73 per share, from $1.68 billion, or $1.84 per share, a year ago.

279,"   By Chuck Mikolajczak  U.S. stocks closed lower on Tuesday as results from IBM and United Technologies dampened early optimism over earnings season and after-the-bell declines in major tech shares suggested losses would continue on Wednesday. The Dow fell 1 percent, with IBM and United Tech contributing around 118 points to the 181-point drop. The decline marked the biggest percentage fall in about two weeks for the blue-chip index. IBM's shares fell 5.9 percent to $163.07, a day after news that the company's revenues dropped for the 13th consecutive quarter and fell short of analyst expectations.Fellow Dow component United Technologies tumbled 7 percent to $102.71 and was the worst performer on the Dow after cutting its full-year profit outlook for the third time this year.""For the first time in a while, fundamentals seem to be driving the action today in an otherwise very quiet macro backdrop and probably will continue to do so for the next couple of weeks as we work through the heart of earnings season,"" said Ryan Larson, head of U.S. equity trading at RBC Global Asset Management in Chicago.  A trio of tech companies pushed stock futures lower after the closing bell, as Apple tumbled 6.2 percent to $122.65, Microsoft lost 3.5 percent to $45.65, and Yahoo shed 2.2 percent to $38.85 after their quarterly results. Volume on the Nasdaq e-minis spiked in the minute after the Apple results as 3,935 contracts changed hands, the most active minute of the day including regular trading hours. Strong earnings from technology companies earlier this earnings season helped drive gains on the Nasdaq, which has outperformed both the Dow and S&P 500 in July. While markets are near record highs, June-quarter earnings of S&P 500 companies are expected to dip 1.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. That marks an improvement from the expected decline of 3 percent on July 1, but well below the 5.9 percent gain forecast on Jan. 1.  So far, 70 percent have reported earnings above analyst expectations, above the 63 percent average beat rate since 1994.However, only 53 percent have topped revenue forecasts, below the 61 percent average beat rate since 2002. U.S. companies are expected to post their worst sales decline in nearly six years in the second quarter, in part due to the strong dollar that reduces the value of U.S. companies' overseas income.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 181.12 points, or 1 percent, to 17,919.29, the S&P 500 lost 9.07 points, or 0.43 percent, to 2,119.21 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 10.74 points, or 0.21 percent, to 5,208.12. NYSE declining issues outnumbered advancing ones 1,841 to 1,217, for a 1.51-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 1,630 issues fell and 1,128 advanced for a 1.44-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.The S&P 500 posted 29 new 52-week highs and 26 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 94 new highs and 114 new lows.

287,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON, July 22  WASHINGTON, July 22 Lockheed Martin Corp's  decision to buy helicopter maker Sikorsky Aircraft and sell $6 billion in lower-margin units marks a clear turning point for Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson, who is shaking up the world's largest weapons maker.Thrust into the CEO job in January 2013 after retiring CEO Robert Stevens' designated successor was fired for having an affair with a subordinate, Hewson spent her first year largely executing a strategy Stevens had mapped out and repairing tense ties with the Pentagon on the $391 billion F-35 fighter program.Over the past 18 months, the seemingly mild-mannered engineer who is ranked No. 4 on Fortune's list of most powerful U.S. women executives, has grown more assertive, her power buoyed by a powerful share price rally that has earned her the respect of her board and key shareholders.Lockheed shares closed at $202.79 on Wednesday, not far off a historic high of $207 reached in February.""It's a great story. The accidental CEO steps in, doubles the share price, raises margins and then executes the biggest M&A deal the company has done in two decades,"" said one industry executive familiar with Hewson's career. ""But remember, the higher you aim, the greater the crash if things don't work out.""Indeed, the Sikorsky acquisition could test the 61-year-old executive's legacy of pleasing investors by running a tight ship.Industry executives said Hewson's track record of cutting costs - she pared the company's workforce by 8,000 people, or 6.7 percent, closed facilities and streamlined its structure - helped her convince Lockheed's generally conservative board to make a bet on the helicopter maker.That may not have been an easy call given a market downturn and uncertain outlook for near-term military sales. To seal the takeover of the unit that United Technologies Corp  unloaded because of its narrow margins, Lockheed agreed to pay a premium $9 billion for a company projecting revenues of just $6.5 billion. NOT WITHOUT RISKS A 30-year veteran of Lockheed, Hewson has focused on long-term investments, like ""over the horizon"" projects such as work on a portable fusion energy reactor, where she has channeled some savings from the recent cost cuts.In February, she told reporters that companies needed to ""see the big picture"" on challenges such climate change, energy and other national security threats. Her legacy and the future outlook of the Pentagon's biggest supplier will be shaped by Lockheed's ability to integrate Sikorsky, offload its services business, and keep key programs like the F-35 and Sikorsky's presidential helicopter on track.Officials are also anxiously awaiting the outcome of two military competitions - a new Air Force bomber valued at over $80 billion for which Lockheed is teamed with Boeing Co, and a multibillion-dollar ground vehicle competition to replace tens of thousands of military vehicles.""These deals are critical to helping her solidify her personal leadership since Lockheed has been heavily focused in recent years on share repurchases, dividends and turning F-35 around,"" said Jim McAleese, a Virginia-based defense consultant.Sikorsky is Lockheed's biggest takeover since it bought Loral Corp's defense electronics business for $9.1 billion in 1996, and is just shy of the $10 billion merger with Martin Marietta in 1994 that created the company as it stands today. An executive at another firm that looked at buying Sikorsky cautioned that the deal is not without risks, given the threat of further defense budget cuts, issues with several helicopter development programs, and overall cost of the deal.Lockheed would also face difficult contract negotiations in coming years with Sikorsky's unions.Still, Hewson was intent on adding another ""signature"" product line to help balance the company's portfolio, which is growing increasingly dependent on the F-35, according to sources familiar with the company. She had Sikorsky ""in her sights"" after her days working on the MH-60R and MH60S helicopters the two company co-produce for the Navy.Beyond the risks in Sikorsky, losing either one of the big weapons programs on the table would also be a big setback given how much the company has invested in both, analysts said.Executives who have worked closely with Hewson describe her as tough and detail-oriented, someone who demands a lot of herself and others around her. An early riser who dashes off emails well before dawn, Hewson is not someone prone to fly off the handle when something goes wrong, associates say.Married and the mother of two grown sons, Hewson promotes diversity programs within the company and writes a regular blog for networking site LinkedIn. She also often brings in writers like ""The Tipping Point"" author Malcolm Gladwell to explore new ideas and stimulate conversations with her leadership team.In a May LinkedIn posting, Hewson drew on her own experience to urge workers to push themselves beyond their comfort zone.""Don't limit yourself by doubting your ability to step up to a challenge ... Take advantage of the growth opportunities that come your way - even if they might seem like a reach,"" she said, adding, ""results matter.""

288,"   By Chuck Mikolajczak and Lewis Krauskopf | NEW YORK, July 23  NEW YORK, July 23 Many U.S. consumer companies are brushing aside worries that China's weakening economy and sputtering stock market will dramatically damage their bottom lines even with early trouble signs in recent earnings reports.Most notably, companies dependent on Chinese infrastructure growth, such as United Technologies Corp and Caterpillar Inc, are claiming soft second-quarter earnings and a downgraded outlook based on weakened Chinese demand.Consumer companies like United Continental Holdings Inc , Apple Inc and General Motors Co, on the other hand, continue to paint a rosy picture based on continued strong demand by the Chinese consumer.The Chinese economy has faced difficulties this year as decelerating growth in factory output, retail sales and domestic investment has been compounded by a slowing property market.China's economy is expected to expand 7 percent this year, with growth slowing to 6.7 percent in 2016, a Reuters poll of analysts showed on Thursday.""We have been worried about it,"" Steve Weeple, head of global equities at global asset manager Standard Life Investments in Boston, told Reuters. ""We would certainly not be surprised to see some of the big consumer packaged goods companies, some of the industrials, reporting that China activity is probably a little below headline growth rates.""Furthermore, a 30 percent early summer selloff in the Chinese stock market could hit companies more broadly in the third quarter. Names that have a reliance on infrastructure growth in China have been hit the hardest so far this quarter. United Technologies fell 7 percent on Tuesday, its worst drop in nearly 4 years, after cutting its full-year profit outlook, in part due to slowness in its elevators business in China as the nation's housing market cools.Caterpillar shares had their worst performance in six months on Thursday after the construction and mining equipment maker reported lower quarterly profit and sales, citing slower construction in China.Even smaller names, generally thought to be more insulated to global economic pressures as a greater portion of their revenue is derived from within the U.S., have noted softness within China's infrastructure. ""We're seeing real industry pressure in construction, in agriculture, in truck and bus inside China - there's been industry contraction in construction (business) year-on-year,"" Rich Lavin, CEO of Commercial Vehicle Group Inc which supplies cab-related products for trucks, bus, farming and other types of vehicles, told Reuters in mid-June before entering its quiet period ahead of earnings.GM, UNITED, APPLE MORE UPBEAT But consumer-facing companies are telling a brighter tale. Harley-Davidson Inc saw a 5 percent pop in its shares on Tuesday, its biggest percentage gain since October,  after its quarterly results showed a 16.6 percent jump in Asia-Pacific sales, which the company attributed to strong demand for its street motorcycles in China and India.""You have to look company by company and product line by product line because there are some things for which there is no substitute,"" said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst, Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. ""It's the cool factor for Harley Davidson.""United Continental, which flies more to China than any of its U.S. rivals, says the region remains a good investment. ""The demand is still growing,"" said Chief Revenue Officer Jim Compton.Despite flat June auto sales in China, General Motors Co  also cited continued strength in China in its earnings report on Thursday, and said it expects to maintain strong profitability there. Shares of the automaker advanced 4 percent to $31.50.The same brand name appeal mentioned by Forrest may be bolstering Apple's China sales. Though the company's shares tumbled nearly 7 percent after its forward-looking guidance missed estimates, it reported a 112 percent sales increase in China over last year and said it plans to open 40 stores in China in the next 12 months.""China was simply spectacular for us,"" said Luca Maestri, Apple's chief financial officer.

289,"  (Adds United Technologies, Lockheed comments)July 24 The U.S. Department of Justice has informed Sikorsky Aircraft that it has started a criminal investigation into allegations the helicopter maker overbilled the U.S. Navy for a contract, Sikorsky's parent company, United Technologies Corp, said on Friday.The Justice Department told Sikorsky of the probe on July 13, and requested that Sikorsky and two subsidiaries produce documents, United Tech said in its quarterly securities filing. (1.usa.gov/1frCTKr).The U.S. government is also seeking about $148 million related to the claims, United Tech said in the filing. Disclosure of the probe follows United Tech's announcement on Monday that it will sell Sikorsky to Lockheed Martin Corp  for $9 billion.""Sikorsky and its subsidiaries intend to cooperate fully in the investigation, which was discussed as part of the transaction with Lockheed Martin and is not expected to affect the close,"" a United Technologies spokesman said in a statement. Lockheed said in a statement: ""We were made aware of the issue during our due diligence and negotiation process and we will continue to monitor the issue in close collaboration with UTC.""The Navy awarded Sikorsky unit Sikorsky Support Services Inc (SSSI) a contract for fixed-wing turboprop training aircraft in 2006. SSSI subcontracted another Sikorsky unit, Derco Aerospace, to procure spare parts. The government alleges that SSSI overbilled the Navy because Derco added profit and overhead costs to the price of the spare parts that it procured and sold to SSSI. United Tech had previously disclosed the allegations and that the U.S. government had filed a complaint in October.The company said it believes Derco was lawfully allowed to add profit and overhead to the cost of the parts.United Tech shares were off 1 percent at $100.10 on Friday morning.

290,"   By Lewis Krauskopf | July 27  July 27 The executive in charge of United Technologies Corp's building systems business, Geraud Darnis, is leaving the company in the latest management change at the U.S. conglomerate.As president of UTC Building & Industrial Systems, Darnis has been overseeing divisions that accounted for just less than half of the company's $65 billion in revenue last year. The divisions include Otis elevators and Carrier climate control systems. Darnis, a 32-year United Tech veteran, will retire in January, the company said in announcing his departure on Monday. The news came less than a week after United Tech cut its 2015 profit outlook for the third time this year, in part because of weaker expected results at Otis, sending its shares down 7 percent.Darnis's departure is the latest executive change under United Tech Chief Executive Greg Hayes, who was promoted from finance chief in November. Alain Bellemare, who held a similar role to Darnis overseeing United Tech's aerospace divisions, left the company at the start of the year and is now CEO of Montreal-based Bombardier Inc. In a statement, Hayes said he would work with Darnis over the next few months ""to ensure a smooth and successful transition of the leadership responsibilities for UTC Building & Industrial Systems"". Darnis became head of building systems after United Tech combined Otis and its UTC Climate, Controls and Security unit into one business in September 2013. Otis and UTC Climate are seeking to capitalize on growth in cities in emerging markets, but have been hurt by concerns over China's slowing economy.United Tech shares were down 0.1 percent at $99.20 on Monday morning.

309,"  (Recasts to add Carter, Lockheed comments)By Andrea Shalal and Yeganeh TorbatiWASHINGTON, Sept 30 Pentagon officials warned on Wednesday against further consolidation in the U.S. weapons industry because fewer defense contractors could lead to higher costs, decreased innovation and less competition.U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said he does not welcome further consolidation among large U.S. weapons makers. Carter was the Pentagon's chief arms buyer in 2011, when the department established a policy that discouraging mergers among large prime contractors, but opened the door to deals among smaller firms.""What I said then and still believe is that it was important to avoid excessive consolidation in the defense industry to the point where we did not have multiple vendors who could compete with one another on many programs,"" Carter told reporters.The comments came days after the U.S. Justice Department approved Lockheed Martin Corp's $9 billion acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp , one of the biggest acquisitions in the weapons industry in years. Lockheed expects to close the deal by the end of November or sooner, depending on when it wins regulatory approval from China and the European Union. ""Lockheed-Sikorsky doesn't mean open season on large prime-level mergers,"" said Jeff Bialos, a former senior Pentagon official who oversaw industry mergers and acquisitions.Dozens of companies in the sector merged in the 1990s as military spending fell sharply after the end of the Cold War. The changes left five large contractors that dominate the market: Lockheed, Boeing Co, Northrop Grumman Corp , General Dynamics Corp and Raytheon Co.Defense Undersecretary Frank Kendall told reporters the U.S. Justice Department had cleared the Lockheed-Sikorsky deal because there was no direct anti-competitive issue, but the department did not want to see its industrial base whittled down to two or three very large suppliers. He said the Pentagon would continue working with the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission to ensure mergers did not reduce competition. Defense officials also planned to meet with Congress to explore legal options to preserve the diversity and breadth of the U.S. defense industry.Kendall said the deal would strengthen Lockheed, the Pentagon's largest supplier, and further reduce the dwindling number of contractors bidding for weapons contracts. Future deals would be evaluated case-by-case, he said.""This transaction is the most significant change at the weapon system prime level since the large-scale consolidation that followed the end of the Cold War,"" he said. He said the deal would move a high percentage of the military helicopter market into a company that dominates the U.S. fighter jet market, due to a winner-take-all approach adopted over a decade ago for the F-35 fighter jet program.""With size comes power, and the department's experience with large defense contractors is that they are not hesitant to use this power for corporate advantage,"" he said.Lockheed fired back in a rare display of disagreement with its largest customer.""There is no evidence to support the view that larger defense companies reduce competition or inhibit innovation,"" Lockheed spokesman Dan Nelson said in statement.""We believe that defense contractors should continue to be assessed based on the performance and effectiveness of the products and solutions offered, not on the size of their company,"" he said.

310,"  WASHINGTON, Sept 30 The Pentagon's chief arms buyer on Wednesday issued a sharp warning against further consolidation in the U.S. weapons industry, and said recent moves toward fewer defense contractors was not a positive trend.Defense Undersecretary Frank Kendall said the U.S. Justice Department had cleared Lockheed Martin Corp's planned acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp because there was no direct anti-competitive issue.

311,"   By Mike Stone  Lockheed Martin Corp is exploring merging some of its information technology and services businesses, with a value of about $4 billion, with another government services contractor, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.The contemplated transaction would create the largest government services contractor in the United States and would generate an estimated $2 billion windfall for Lockheed, the people said.Lockheed, the Pentagon's largest supplier, is looking to pay down debt following its agreement in July to acquire Sikorsky Aircraft, the helicopter unit of United Technologies Corp , for $9 billion in cash.CACI International Inc and Science Applications International Corp are in early-stage talks with Lockheed about a so-called Reverse Morris Trust (RMT) deal for the assets, a transaction that would avert a hefty tax bill, the people said. Lockheed has also contacted other companies to determine their interest in a potential RMT deal, including Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp and Leidos Holdings Inc, the people added.The deal under discussion is part of a strategic review that Lockheed announced on July 20. The company said it would carry out a strategic review of government information technology and technical services businesses in two divisions with total estimated 2015 revenue of $6 billion, with the goal of spinning off the units or selling them to outside investors. The sources cautioned that there was no certainty that the RMT option would be chosen, and asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential.Lockheed, Booz Allen Hamilton and Leidos declined to comment, while CACI and Science Applications International did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Lockheed makes F-35 fighter jets, naval ships and government satellites. It has been expanding its weapons-making capabilities and moving away from more commoditized services.The programs being reviewed for sale or spinoff are mainly in Lockheed's information systems and government services business, but also include units in its missiles and fire-control division. The programs, which have more than 17,000 employees, have been struggling due to reduced government spending, increased competition and delays in new contracts.Bethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed has forecast sales at the information systems unit to decline in the mid-single digit percentage range in 2015. It plans to cut about 500 jobs there by mid-November.Last month, Lockheed said U.S. officials had approved its acquisition of Black Hawk helicopter maker Sikorsky. That deal is expected to close before the end of the year, possibly by late November.

312,"   By Idrees Ali | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Oct 13 The pending takeover of United Technologies Corp's Sikorsky Aircraft by Lockheed Martin Corp will not affect prototype work on an aircraft that will replace thousands of helicopters, U.S. Army acquisitions chief Heidi Shyu said on Tuesday.Last year one team from Boeing Co and Sikorsky and one team from Textron Inc's Bell Helicopter were selected to build models of a multi-role vertical-lift aircraft as a part of the U.S. Army's plan, the JMR technology demonstrator program, to replace aging helicopters.The future vertical life aircraft will replace up to 4,000 medium class UH-60 Black Hawk utility helicopters built by Sikorsky and Boeing's Apache attack helicopter.""No, it doesn't change it because I think what is important is you've got the Boeing-Sikorsky team competing against Bell,"" Shyu told reporters at the annual Association of United States Army conference in Washington. ""As far I know there's two separate teams,"" Shyu said.She said first flight tests were expected in 2017 and would define requirements for the future vertical lift aircraft. The pending Lockheed-Sikorsky deal, worth more than $8 billion, could be important because Lockheed is providing parts for Bell's V-280 Valor under the demonstrator program. Bell is the prime contractor on the V-280 Valor but has teamed up with 11 other companies for parts.Pentagon arms buyer Frank Kendall has previously said that mergers were increasing the leverage companies have with the U.S. Department of Defense. A representative from Bell said the agreement with Lockheed on the demonstrator had been amended to clarify that they would stay on track after the Lockheed-Sikorsky deal.""I mean the point is it's not an insignificant event (Lockheed-Sikorsky deal) but it's not ... sky is falling kind of event either,"" said Keith Flail, Bell's programs director for the demonstrator and vertical lift program.A Sikorsky representative declined to comment on the deal and how it might affect the demonstrator program because the team had not been involved in merger discussions.""But we're teams on the JMR medium in support of future vertical lift and we are committed to continue that,"" said Douglas Shidler, the Sikorsky program director for the JMR technology demonstrator program.

DSCA said the Royal Saudi Land Forces Aviation Command (RSLFAC) planned to use the new helicopters for search and rescue, disaster relief, humanitarian support, counterterrorism, and combat operations. U.S. lawmakers have 30 days to block the sale, although such action is rare since arms sales are usually well vetted in advance of a formal notification to Congress.

314,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Oct 14 Lockheed Martin Corp's  $9 billion purchase of Sikorsky Aircraft from United Technologies Corp could close by late October or early November, well before the initial year-end target, three sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.Lockheed announced last month that officials in the United States, South Korea and Japan had approved the deal, but it was waiting for other regulatory approvals.Regulatory approvals from China and the European Union are expected next week, according to two of the sources, who all said they were not authorized to speak publicly. ""The momentum is picking up,"" said one of the sources. ""The deal should close by late October or early November."" When it announced the deal on July 20, Lockheed said it did not anticipate major hurdles, and expected to close the transaction by late in the fourth quarter of 2015 or early 2016.The acquisition will be Lockheed's largest since it acquired Loral Corp's defense electronics business for $9.1 billion in 1996. It will open key foreign markets for Lockheed, which has annual revenues of $45 billion, and already dwarfs its nearest competitors, the defense businesses of Boeing Co and Northrop Grumman Corp.

315,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Oct 14 Saudi Arabia signed an agreement last week with the U.S. government for the purchase of 320 more Patriot PAC-3 missiles built by Lockheed Martin Corp , and may accelerate its plans to buy the longer-range THAAD system, a senior Lockheed official told Reuters this week.The PAC-3 sale is part of a larger possible deal valued at $5.4 billion for a total of 600 PAC-3 missiles that was approved by the U.S. government in July. Such approvals, which do not guarantee a deal will be reached, are followed by negotiations about an actual sale.Saudi Arabia, a key U.S. ally, is participating in coalition efforts to fight Islamic State militants in Syria, while also battling Iranian-allied Houthi rebels in Yemen, who have already fired Scud missiles against the kingdom. Saudi Arabia also remains concerned about the growing military strength of Iran.The PAC-3 missile defends against incoming aircraft and missiles, and it is currently used by the United States, the Netherlands, Germany, Japan, Taiwan and the United Arab Emirates, according to Lockheed. Joe Garland, vice president of business development for Lockheed's missiles and fire control division, told Reuters this week that Saudi Arabia would likely follow up with a purchase next year of the remaining 280 PAC-3 missiles in the agreement.He said the Gulf country was also looking to accelerate a likely purchase of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-ballistic missile system known as THAAD, which is also built by Lockheed, and a deal could be reached in 2017. Lockheed officials had previously said they were upbeat  about the prospects of reaching a THAAD deal, but that it could take three to five years to reach a deal.The U.S. State Department declined comment. Garland said evolving threats in the region had prompted Saudi Arabia to ""look at the opportunity to accelerate"" that purchase.Riki Ellison, founder of the non-profit Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, said the urgency of Saudi's missile defense purchases was driven by Scud missile launches from Yemen and Saudi Arabia's concerns about Iran.Separately, the U.S. government said on Wednesday it has approved the possible sale to Saudi Arabia of nine UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters built by Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp, in a deal valued at $495 million.

Even with the share repurchase, Hayes said United Technologies could still make acquisitions.""We're looking at those deals in the $1 (billion) to $5 billion range and clearly we have the capacity to continue to do those deals,"" Hayes said.For the third quarter, United Technologies said net income fell to $1.36 billion from $1.85 billion a year ago.Earnings from continuing operations declined to $1.61 per share from $1.93 a share a year ago. Analysts, on average, were expecting $1.55 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue fell 5.7 percent to $13.79 billion, about $770 million below analysts' expectations.Sales fell 1 percent, excluding the negative impact from currency swings. The company cited a delay in jet engine deliveries for its Pratt & Whitney division that it expects to recover in the fourth quarter.""Considering the revenue headwinds that UTX faced in the quarter, we view this as a good operating performance,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Stallard said in a research note.

319,"   By Ankit Ajmera and Andrea Shalal  Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), the Pentagon's No. 1 weapons supplier, reported better-than-expected quarterly results on higher demand for its F-35 fighter jets, and said it expects full-year revenue at the higher end of its forecast.Revenue at Lockheed's aeronautics division increased about 11 percent to $3.92 billion in the third quarter, with $500 million coming from additional sales of the F-35 fighter jet, it said on Tuesday.Lockheed is developing and building F-35 jets for the U.S. military and nine other countries. With estimated development and procurement costs of $391 billion for the United States alone, the F-35 is the world's most expensive weapons program.Lockheed did not address the timing of its planned purchase of Sikorsky Aircraft, but United Technologies Corp (UTX.N),  which owns Sikorsky, expects to close the deal in the fourth quarter.Excluding the Sikorsky deal and a strategic review aimed at selling or spinning off its services businesses, Lockheed said 2016 sales should be comparable with 2015.Total operating margin should range from 11.0 percent to 11.5 percent, down from the expected margin of about 12 percent in 2015, it said. The company sees 2015 sales of $45 billion, and segment operating profit of $5.4 billion. It had forecast sales of $43.5 billion to $45 billion, with segment operating profit of $5.225 billion to $5.375 billion.Lockheed also forecast earnings per share of $11.30 in 2015, the high end of its earlier forecast of $11.00 to $11.30.Analysts, on average, looked for 2015 sales of $44.82 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Lockheed said it had $2.4 billion in potential cost and termination liability exposure, given its decision to self-fund work on C-130J transport planes and F-35 jets for the U.S. government while contracts are being negotiated.It said it was finalizing both agreements with the U.S. government and expected to receive more funding this year. About $750 million in cash the company expected to receive in 2015 could be delayed until 2016.For the quarter ended Sept. 27, total net sales rose to $11.46 billion from $11.11 billion a year earlier. Net income fell to $865 million, or $2.77 per share, from $888 million, or $2.76 per share, a year earlier.Analysts, on average, expected profit of $2.72 per share on revenue of $11.14 billion.Up to Monday's close, Lockheed's stock had risen 9.4 percent this year, compared with a 1.5 percent decline in the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace & Defense Index .DJUSAE.

339,"   By Alwyn Scott and Amrutha Penumudi  United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) forecast a slight profit rise next year and announced a $1.5 billion restructuring plan to reduce costs, sending its shares up in extended trading.The U.S. aerospace and building systems conglomerate said 2016 adjusted earnings will be $6.30 to $6.60 per share on revenue of $56 billion to $58 billion. Most of the EPS gain will come from share buybacks, it noted.The company also expects 2015 adjusted earnings of $6.20-$6.30 per share, raising the lower end of the previous estimate by 5 cents.The restructuring will cost about $500 million a year over three years, Chief Executive Officer Gregory Hayes said at an investor and analyst meeting. When completed, the program is expected to generate about $900 million in annual savings, mainly through factory consolidation, Hayes said.United Technologies shares were up 1.4 percent at $95.20 in extended trading. While the restructuring and about $2 billion in research and development spending next year could cause GAAP earnings to fall in 2016, it positions the maker of maker Otis elevators, Carrier heating and cooling systems and Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines for longer-term growth, Hayes said.The company expects slowing in China and weak growth in Latin America and Europe. It also forecasts the dollar at parity with the euro, versus an average of $1.12 per euro this year.  Analysts described the forecast as conservative. But it follows a year in which United Technologies cut its 2015 profit outlook three times and saw its results dented by the strong dollar and pressures in its various businesses.The Pratt & Whitney division is expected to see a slight rise in sales next year, and it faces rising costs as it ramps up production to about 200 units. Hayes said United Technologies is focused on ""reinvigorating top-line growth"" and would tolerate lower profit margins in some areas to increase sales. ""We have lost (market) share over the last 10 years,"" as margins rose to 20 percent from 12 percent, Hayes said. Analysts expect 2016 earnings of $6.57 per share on a revenue of $58.58 billion according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

346,"  WASHINGTON Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) on Tuesday said commercial helicopter sales for its Sikorsky Aircraft unit this year were expected to be about $375 million, half the level projected last summer, due to the sustained drop in world oil prices.""I think the biggest change that we are seeing from when we announced this deal is the changes in sort of the OEM helicopter sales in the commercial marketplace, obviously driven by the oil and gas marketplace as we sit here today,"" Lockheed Chief Financial Officer Bruce Tanner said in an earnings call.Lockheed expected the unit's commercial helicopter sales to be about $750 million, down from a 2014 peak of $1.5 billion, when it announced in July plans to buy the maker of Black Hawk helicopters from United Technologies Corp. (UTX.N), Tanner said.The Bethesda, Maryland-based company closed the $9 billion purchase in November.But oil prices last week touched 12-year lows under $30 a barrel before staging a modest rally. Sikorsky sees good prospects for international helicopter sales in areas such as search and rescue and border patrol, which would offset a drop-off in sales to the oil and gas sector. But Tanner said those prospects would not translate into firm orders until after 2016 or 2017, Tanner said.""You should think of that primarily as the transition from development programs where we are seeing lower margins, therefore, lower cash ... to pure production programs that should be sort of normal cash-generating business,"" he said.  Tanner added that he expected Sikorsky to be a larger cash generator than under United Technologies because of Lockheed's ability to negotiate contacts with the government. Lockheed is the Pentagon's No. 1 supplier. ""We know the game plan, we know the playbook; we just have to sort of execute it with Sikorsky,"" he said.

347,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) on Tuesday announced a $5 billion tax-free deal to combine its information systems and government services business with Leidos Holdings Inc (LDOS.N), and forecast a lower-than-expected profit in 2016.Lockheed's shares fell as much as 5 percent amid confusion over future prospects for the Pentagon's No. 1 supplier, although the stock recovered after Lockheed officials reassured analysts they still expected rising sales and earnings in coming years.Leidos shares dropped as much as 9 percent and were off 7.6 percent at $49.56 in mid afternoon. Lockheed was down 0.8 percent to $209.25. Leidos, which was split off from Science Applications International Corp (SAIC.N) in 2013, said the combined company would have annual revenues of $10 billion, making it the largest U.S. government services provider.It forecast improved margins and a slight boost in earnings if the deal goes through, and promised shareholders a $1 billion special dividend, or about $13.50 a share. Lockheed would receive a one-time payment of $1.8 billion, and use the money to pay down debt, raise its dividend and possibly buy back shares. It also projected a $1.5 billion gain when the deal is finalized in the third or fourth quarter.Separately, Lockheed reported higher profit and revenues for the fourth quarter and the full year. But the company forecast 2016 earnings of $11.45 to $11.75 per share, below expectations.Despite initial concerns, Rob Stallard, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said the Leidos deal appeared to be neutral at worst for Lockheed's earnings per share. He added that the company was ""still on the earnings and cash growth trajectory that we had previously anticipated."" Lockheed said the Leidos deal would lower its share count by 15 million shares through a split-off transaction, offsetting the effect of about $360 million in lost profit that would go to the combined company.Lockheed also said it had a record backlog of $99.6 billion, including $15.6 billion contributed by Sikorsky Aircraft, the helicopter maker acquired from United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) last year and bode well for future sales growth. Lockheed Chief Executive Officer Marillyn Hewson told analysts the company was not seeing a big pullback in orders from the Middle East or elsewhere due to the sharp drop in oil prices.She said about 21 percent of 2015 revenues came from international sales, and demand remained strong for missile defense equipment, F-35 fighter jets and munitions.But officials said lower oil prices had cut sharply into Sikorsky's projected commercial helicopter sales.

354,"   By Ginger Gibson | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said he would impose taxes on Carrier air conditioning units manufactured in Mexico in light of the company's decision to move production from Indiana, a position in line with his strong opposition to international trade deals.Video of the company's announcement last week to employees went viral on the Internet, showing emotional reactions to the loss of jobs while a representative of the company explained the move was ""strictly a business decision."" Carrier, a manufacturer of air conditioning units, is owned by United Technologies Corp and announced it would be moving 1,400 jobs to Monterrey, Mexico.During Saturday night's Republican debate, Trump said if he were president, he would approach Carrier officials and give them two choices. ""I'm going to tell them, 'Now I'm going to get consensus from Congress and we're going to tax you,'"" Trump said. ""'So stay where you are [in Mexico] or build in the United States.' Because we are killing ourselves with trade pacts that are no good for us and no good for our workers.""A central part of Trump's campaign message has been his opposition to international trade pacts that allow products manufactured overseas to be imported with limited or no tariffs. It's a policy position that reverberates with middle- and low- income Americans, who have watched manufacturing jobs leave the country in the last several decades. Trump cited the video of the workers, which has more than 2.8 million views on YouTube, at the debate. ""If you saw the people, because they have a video of the announcement that Carrier is moving to Mexico, they were laid off,"" he said. ""They were crying. It was a very sad situation.""

366,"   By Alwyn Scott and Andrea Shalal | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Honeywell International Inc's (HON.N) proposal to buy rival United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) would create an industrial giant bigger than aircraft makers Boeing Co (BA.N) or Airbus Group (AIR.PA), potentially changing the balance of power between manufacturer and supplier.Pricing power is a key concern of the big aircraft makers, and it is a central issue in the battle between United Technologies and Honeywell. United Technologies on Friday rejected Honeywell's $90.7 billion offer, citing customer concerns among other big issues.With nearly $100 billion in annual sales and significant combined market share for such key aircraft components as wheels, brakes, power units, ventilation systems, electronics and small engines, a combined Honeywell/United Technologies would have the heft to fight price-cutting demands from customers, industry experts said. Boeing and Airbus have encouraged small and mid-sized suppliers to merge, so they would have more financial and management depth to serve the plane makers as they ramp up production over the next several years. That growth requires investments in machines and people that small companies may not be able to support.At the same time, however, the two aircraft makers have pushed suppliers for price cuts, according to industry executives and filings by some suppliers.Honeywell on Friday portrayed a combined Honeywell/United Technologies as a company that would have the resources to hold its own in this environment. Honeywell Chief Executive Dave Cote, in a presentation made to United Technologies on Feb. 19 and made public on Friday, said the two companies together would enjoy ""significant commercial opportunities to drive revenue growth."" A heftier research and development budget could fund investment in new technology. And they could boost profit margins by slashing annual costs by $3.5 billion, cutting redundant staffs and purchasing materials at higher volumes, Honeywell said.Boeing and Airbus aren't waiting for a deal to materialize to express concern about Cote's vision.Airbus Group Chief Executive Tom Enders said the deal would not be in his company's interest. Boeing said it would scrutinize the implications, saying in a statement: ""Healthy competition in our supply chain is vitally important to Boeing and our commercial and military customers."" The aircraft makers have used leverage afforded by their supply contracts to renegotiate pricing for components under certain conditions, including when a company is sold. Those negotiations can be protracted and complex, even when a big merger is not at stake. Boeing and another large supplier, Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc (SPR.N), for example, have been in talks since November 2014 on new contracts governing parts for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and other aircraft, according to regulatory filings and people familiar with the discussions. While it may be impractical to shift fuselage, wing section and other large components to new suppliers, Boeing can ""trim around the edges"" by moving smaller parts, said a source familiar with the talks. ""And those smaller parts are more profitable.""United Technologies, in a lengthy statement opposing the Honeywell overture, argued that the aircraft makers would see to it that the combined companies had to cut prices by 5 to 10 percent.  United Technologies also said Honeywell's per share offer of $42.63 in cash and 0.614 Honeywell share ""grossly undervalues"" the company.Regulators could compel Honeywell and United Technologies to sell some operations to address antitrust issues.United Technologies in its formal response cited the potential for divestitures that would diminish the value of the combined companies.

United Technologies on Friday rejected Honeywell's $90.7 billion offer, citing customer concerns among other big issues.With nearly $100 billion in annual sales and significant combined market share for such key aircraft components as wheels, brakes, power units, ventilation systems, electronics and small engines, a combined Honeywell/United Technologies would have the heft to fight price-cutting demands from customers, industry experts said.Boeing and Airbus have encouraged small and mid-sized suppliers to merge, so they would have more financial and management depth to serve the plane makers as they ramp up production over the next several years.That growth requires investments in machines and people that small companies may not be able to support.At the same time, however, the two aircraft makers have pushed suppliers for price cuts, according to industry executives and filings by some suppliers. Honeywell on Friday portrayed a combined Honeywell/United Technologies as a company that would have the resources to hold its own in this environment.Honeywell Chief Executive Dave Cote, in a presentation made to United Technologies on Feb. 19 and made public on Friday, said the two companies together would enjoy ""significant commercial opportunities to drive revenue growth."" A heftier research and development budget could fund investment in new technology. And they could boost profit margins by slashing annual costs by $3.5 billion, cutting redundant staffs and purchasing materials at higher volumes, Honeywell said.Boeing and Airbus aren't waiting for a deal to materialize to express concern about Cote's vision. Airbus Group Chief Executive Tom Enders said the deal would not be in his company's interest. Boeing said it would scrutinize the implications, saying in a statement: ""Healthy competition in our supply chain is vitally important to Boeing and our commercial and military customers.""The aircraft makers have used leverage afforded by their supply contracts to renegotiate pricing for components under certain conditions, including when a company is sold.Those negotiations can be protracted and complex, even when a big merger is not at stake. Boeing and another large supplier, Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc, for example, have been in talks since November 2014 on new contracts governing parts for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and other aircraft, according to regulatory filings and people familiar with the discussions. While it may be impractical to shift fuselage, wing section and other large components to new suppliers, Boeing can ""trim around the edges"" by moving smaller parts, said a source familiar with the talks. ""And those smaller parts are more profitable.""United Technologies, in a lengthy statement opposing the Honeywell overture, argued that the aircraft makers would see to it that the combined companies had to cut prices by 5 to 10 percent.United Technologies also said Honeywell's per share offer of $42.63 in cash and 0.614 Honeywell share ""grossly undervalues"" the company.Regulators could compel Honeywell and United Technologies to sell some operations to address antitrust issues.United Technologies in its formal response cited the potential for divestitures that would diminish the value of the combined companies.

375,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Air Force on Monday named Pratt & Whitney as the engine maker for the new Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) long-range strike bomber, and defended the plane's ""cost plus incentive fee"" contract that has been challenged by U.S. lawmakers.U.S. Air Force Secretary Deborah James revealed the names of the engine maker, a unit of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) and other key suppliers at a Pentagon news conference amid growing calls for more transparency about the classified arms program.Other key suppliers for the new B-21 bomber include the U.S. units of two British suppliers, BAE Systems Plc (BAES.L) and GKN Plc (GKN.L), as well as Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc (SPR.N), Orbital ATK Inc (OA.N), Rockwell Collins Inc (COL.N) and Janicki Industries, a family-owned company, James said.Boeing Co (BA.N) and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) last month dropped their challenge to the multibillion-dollar bomber contract that Northrop won in October.James said the suppliers named Monday would work on the airframe and mission systems of the new flying wing stealth bomber, but gave no details. Lieutenant General Arnold Bunch, the Air Force's top military acquisition official, declined to say where Northrop would assemble the planes.He said the Air Force hoped in time to provide the value of the bomber development contract and associated incentive fees.He said the incentive fees were based on cost and performance, with an emphasis on meeting plans to start using the new planes in combat from the mid 2020s. The Air Force initially estimated it would cost $23.5 billion to develop the new bomber, but has not released terms of its contract with Northrop. Analysts have said the overall deal could be worth $80 billion to Northrop and its suppliers over time.James said the Air Force was working to address questions raised by Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain about the Northrop contract. McCain fears it could leave the U.S. government liable for potential cost increases. She said it would take ""money and time"" to cancel and redo the deal if McCain succeeds in blocking it.McCain says the Air Force has been spared from $1 billion in cost overruns on a new refueling plane being built by Boeing since that plane was developed under a fixed price contract.But Bunch said this program was different since it involved a wholly new airplane, and the company had no potential commercial or foreign military sales customers to help defray its costs.

376,"   By Alwyn Scott | NEW YORK  NEW YORK United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), maker of jet engines, aircraft components and building systems, said it is open to doing a large acquisition despite rejecting a merger proposed by Honeywell International Inc (HON.N).""I wouldn't be afraid to do a big deal,"" Chief Executive Gregory Hayes said at an investor meeting on Thursday. But ""it's got to be something that's actionable ... and the regulatory hurdles have to be manageable.""Hayes said there was appetite in UTC's commercial businesses, including elevators, fire and security systems, and possibly its aerospace systems business, to make a sizable acquisition.UTC recently scotched an approach by Honeywell because the deal faced ""very real"" obstacles from regulators and customers, Hayes said.Without an acquisition, the company is poised for ""huge growth"" based in part on urbanization and rising disposable incomes in the developing world, he said. ""We don't need M&A for growth,"" Hayes said, noting the company was not looking to increase debt for a short-term stock gain.Asked if the company was concerned about pressure from activist investors following the Honeywell approach, Hayes pointed to two board appointments the company made in December: T. Rowe Price Group Inc Chairman Brian Rogers and Frederic Reynolds, former Chief Financial Officer of CBS. ""We brought these guys on because we needed the voice of the investor on the board,"" Hayes said. UTC forecast compounded annual revenue growth of 5 percent to 8 percent through the end of the decade. Its Pratt & Whitney aircraft engine division is poised for revenue growth in excess of 10 percent a year over that period.The investment in aerospace systems and Pratt has positioned those units for ""nearly a trillion dollars in future business over next 25 years,"" Hayes said, referring to sales. Pratt engines, both those already in service and those already sold, will account for $750 billion of the total, he said. The Otis elevator unit is aiming to boost growth, after recent years when efforts to widen profit margins cost it market share. The company said it cut its forecast for heating, ventilation and air conditioning sales this year to low single-digit growth from mid single-digit growth, mainly due to slow sales in the Middle East.""The work there has come to pretty much of a halt due to what's going on in the oil industry,"" said Bob McDonough, president of the Climate, Controls and Security business.

""We don't need M&A for growth,"" Hayes said, noting the company was not looking to increase debt for a short-term stock gain.Asked if the company was concerned about pressure from activist investors following the Honeywell approach, Hayes pointed to two board appointments the company made in December: T. Rowe Price Group Inc Chairman Brian Rogers and Frederic Reynolds, former Chief Financial Officer of CBS. ""We brought these guys on because we needed the voice of the investor on the board,"" Hayes said. UTC forecast compounded annual revenue growth of 5 percent to 8 percent through the end of the decade. Its Pratt & Whitney aircraft engine division is poised for revenue growth in excess of 10 percent a year over that period.The investment in aerospace systems and Pratt has positioned those units for ""nearly a trillion dollars in future business over next 25 years,"" Hayes said, referring to sales. Pratt engines, both those already in service and those already sold, will account for $750 billion of the total, he said. The Otis elevator unit is aiming to boost growth, after recent years when efforts to widen profit margins cost it market share. The company said it cut its forecast for heating, ventilation and air conditioning sales this year to low single-digit growth from mid single-digit growth, mainly due to slow sales in the Middle East.""The work there has come to pretty much of a halt due to what's going on in the oil industry,"" said Bob McDonough, president of the Climate, Controls and Security business.

381,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) has ""no regrets"" about buying Sikorsky for $9 billion even though sliding oil prices have taken a bigger bite than expected from the company's commercial helicopter sales, Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson said Tuesday.Hewson told reporters at the company's annual media day that buying Sikorsky from United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) was ""absolutely a great opportunity"" and Lockheed remained confident about its long-term prospects, despite the drop in commercial sales as energy companies have slashed spending.She said she expected oil prices to recover over the longer term.Lockheed closed its $9 billion acquisition of Sikorsky from United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) in November. Sharp declines in oil revenues have resulted in bigger than expected declines in Sikorsky's commercial helicopter revenues, prompting some analysts and industry executives to say Lockheed likely overpaid for the storied Black Hawk makers.Lockheed Chief Financial Officer Bruce Tanner rejected speculation that Lockheed had paid 20 times Sikorsky's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and said that was an ""overstated number.""He told Reuters in an interview that Lockheed remained upbeat about Sikorsky's longer-term prospects, and said its cash generation would also increase as it moved ahead on several U.S. military development programs, including a new presidential helicopter program. ""We did not buy this business for the next three years; we bought it for the next three decades,"" Tanner said.Dale Bennett, who heads Lockheed's Mission Systems and Training business that now includes Sikorsky, said the unit's margins were on par with what Lockheed was used to, and its revenues and cash generation would improve in coming years. ""There's absolutely no buyer's remorse,"" Bennett told Reuters in an interview at the company's annual media day. ""It’s (just) going to look a little depressed for the first couple of years as we absorb the amortization and the integration costs.""Lockheed officials said they were optimistic about foreign sales prospects for CH-53K heavy lift helicopters and H-60 Black Hawk helicopters built by its new Sikorsky unit, which would help offset the slump in commercial orders.

389,"   By Alwyn Scott | NEW YORK  NEW YORK United Technologies Corp saw an uptick in equipment orders in China in the first quarter, Chief Executive Greg Hayes said in an interview on Wednesday, as the company posted results that beat analyst estimates.The maker of Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines and parts, Otis elevators and climate controls and security systems, expects activity in China and Europe to keep rising, Hayes said.""It feels like things have at least bottomed out both in Europe and in China,"" Hayes said. ""We expect a better back half (of the year) at Otis as well as at our climate controls and securities business.""The U.S. market continues to be strong, with new orders for Otis equipment up 33 percent in North America, Chief Financial Officer Akhil Johri said in the same interview.The company's shares rose 1.3 percent to $106.06. Sales of aftermarket aircraft parts and repair services rose an exceptional 19 percent in the quarter. That reflected the market catching up after slow sales last year and a rise in major overhauls of V2500 engines on Airbus A320 planes that are reaching a service milestone. The company expects the trend will continue for the next few years, though at lower growth levels.In addition, airlines are flying more hours, and some are keeping older planes in service, requiring more spare parts.""We have seen (aircraft) retirements last year slow down as fuel prices have slowed down,"" Hayes said.  ""What that means is they are flying the older planes longer. They aren't as anxious perhaps to take some of the new, more expensive equipment and as a result, it's probably good news for us in the aftermarket for a bit here as long as oil prices stay low.""In part to capture such growth, Boeing Co is aggressively building its own aftermarket business.Hayes said Boeing has not tried to take aftermarket business away from United Technologies. ""Boeing got its pound of flesh from partnering for success a couple of years ago on the 787,"" Hayes said, referring to a Boeing program to reduce the prices it pays suppliers for parts. ""We have been very guarded in terms of giving aftermarket away because ... we make big investments up front and the only way we recover it is in the aftermarket.""The company reported adjusted first-quarter profit of $1.47 a share, beating consensus estimates by 8 cents, and reaffirmed its full year profit forecast.

Airbus Group SE (AIR.PA), a major customer of both Honeywell and UTC, expressed concern that the merger would not be in its interests.Cote, 64, said the failed talks with UTC would not dissuade him from considering other aerospace companies. His greater concern is being disciplined on price.  ""If you overpay, you're dead,"" he said.

427,"   By Roberta Rampton | WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.  WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders turned up the pressure on President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday about his pledge to try to stop an Indiana air conditioner manufacturer from moving 1,400 jobs to Mexico.Both Sanders, who challenged Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination, and Trump seized on an announcement earlier this year by United Technologies Corp's Carrier division that it would shift production to Mexico as an example of how trade deals hurt U.S. workers.Sanders on Saturday warned ""it is not good enough to save some of these jobs"" and said Trump should use as leverage United Technologies' defense contracts, Export-Import Bank financing, and tax breaks. ""I call on Mr. Trump to make it clear to the CEO of United Technologies that if his firm wants to receive another defense contract from the taxpayers of this country, it must not move these plants to Mexico,"" the senator from Vermont said in a statement.A representative for Carrier declined to comment on Sanders' statement. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, said on Thursday that he was ""working hard, even on Thanksgiving"" to get the plant to stay and said he was ""making progress"" on the issue. Carrier Corp. confirmed it had ""discussions with the incoming administration."" Neither side has provided details.Trump had threatened to slap taxes on the company's air conditioners made in Mexico and shipped back to the United States. A spokesman was not immediately available for comment on Sanders' statement on Saturday. Sanders said he would soon introduce legislation that would prevent companies that outsource from receiving federal contracts, grants and loans, and force companies that outsource jobs to pay a penalty tax and pay back tax breaks.

428,"   By David Shepardson | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) has reached a deal with President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence to keep close to 1,000 jobs at its Carrier Corp air conditioner plant in Indianapolis, roughly halving the number of U.S. jobs it planned to move to Mexico.The deal, announced by Carrier on Twitter late on Tuesday, is a victory for Trump, who campaigned hard on keeping jobs in the United States and specifically criticized Carrier for shipping jobs overseas, messages which appealed to blue-collar workers in the Midwest.""I will be going to Indiana on Thursday to make a major announcement concerning Carrier A.C. staying in Indianapolis,"" Trump tweeted late on Tuesday. ""Great deal for workers!""Company officials, Trump and Pence, who is the governor of Indiana, will announce some of the deal's terms on Thursday, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Indiana state officials were involved in the talks, but it was unclear what, if any, inducements the state may have made to encourage Carrier to keep the jobs in the United States.Carrier's parent, United Technologies, has a strong incentive to keep good relations with Trump and his incoming administration, given that a portion of its estimated $57 billion revenue this year will come through U.S. military contracts at its Pratt & Whitney and UTC Aerospace Systems units. Carrier announced plans in February to close an air conditioner factory in Indianapolis with the loss of 1,400 jobs. It said a further 700 jobs would be cut from another plant in Huntington, Indiana, northeast of Indianapolis.The company planned to move the jobs to Monterrey, Mexico, starting in 2017. Local union leaders said Carrier told them it would pay Mexican workers $3 an hour compared with more than $20 for their U.S. counterparts.The announcement prompted attacks from Trump during his campaign, and he vowed to impose hefty taxes on imported Carrier products if it did not reverse the move. He predicted in February the company would call him to say ""Mr. President, Carrier has decided to stay in Indiana,"" and promised the chances of the plant staying open was ""100 percent.""As recently as 10 days ago, Carrier insisted it had no plans to reverse course, but then acknowledged on the Thanksgiving Day holiday on Nov. 24 that it was in talks with the Trump transition team.Trump has promised to keep U.S. jobs from moving overseas by renegotiating or withdrawing from trade agreements and imposing tariffs on foreign-made goods. But it is not clear he can reverse broader trends that have led to the loss of more than 5 million U.S. manufacturing jobs since 2000. Democratic Indiana Senator Joe Donnelly praised the announcement by Carrier to keep jobs in the state, but said ""there are at least two other companies currently planning to move Hoosier (Indiana) jobs out of the country. We need to change our laws to encourage companies to grow here at home.""Carrier is just one of many U.S. manufacturers moving jobs to Mexico. However, videos of a company official delivering the news to the Indianapolis plant's stunned workforce, posted on YouTube, provided a vivid look at the pain and anger such decisions cause.Earlier this month, Ford Motor Co (F.N) made a decision to keep production of a Lincoln sport utility vehicle in Kentucky, which Trump claimed as a victory for keeping the plant in the United States, even though Ford never had plans to move the entire factory to Mexico.

430,"  Nov 29 U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will visit Indiana on Thursday to announce a deal with United Technologies Corp on keeping close to 1,000 factory jobs in its Carrier plant, CNBC reported, citing sources.The deal, which includes new inducements from the state, will be spearheaded by former Indiana Governor Mike Pence, the vice president-elect, CNBC posted on its Twitter handle. (bit.ly/2gH6PmG) U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders turned up the pressure on Trump, on Saturday, about his pledge to try to stop an Indiana air conditioner manufacturer from moving 1,400 jobs to Mexico. Both Sanders, who challenged Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination, and Trump seized on an announcement earlier this year by United Technologies's Carrier division that it would shift production to Mexico as an example of how trade deals hurt U.S. workers. United Technologies was not immediately available for comment.

431,"   By David Shepardson | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Indiana state officials have agreed to give United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) $7 million worth of tax breaks to encourage the company to keep at least 1,069 jobs at its Carrier unit in Indianapolis, Carrier and the state said on Thursday.President-elect Donald Trump has claimed credit for keeping well-paid manufacturing jobs in the country, but the deal is less than a complete victory for the Republican who campaigned on ""putting America first.""In the election campaign, Trump vowed to impose hefty tariffs if Carrier did not reverse course on shifting jobs to Mexico. The deal means Carrier will still send an estimated 1,300 jobs there.United Technologies chief executive Gregory Hayes said at an event that the company will invest more than $16 million over two years to keep its Indianapolis plant in the state.The Indiana Economic Development Corp said it has offered Carrier $5 million in conditional tax credits based on a plan to retain 1,069 jobs with an average wage of $30.91 per hour, spokeswoman Abby Gras said.She declined to say how many of those jobs are at the plant or at the company's headquarters, but the Wall Street Journal reported the deal would save about 800 of the 1,400 jobs at the plant and about 300 at the headquarters. Indiana is also offering $1 million in training grants to support workforce development and $1 million in tax credits, Gras said. The agreement has not been finalized yet.Some other details of the deal in Vice President-elect and Indiana Governor Mike Pence's state were unclear but it has already been criticized on the left and right.Trump and Pence celebrated the 1,000 jobs deal at an event in Indianapolis on Thursday, but employers elsewhere in Indiana are laying off five times as many workers because of foreign competition. Trump ""did just what he said he would do,"" Pence said, recounting his push to convince Carrier to remain in Indiana. ""He made the case for America.""Neither Trump nor Pence made any reference to United Technologies' planned job cuts in Indiana.Leftist Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who lost the  Democratic presidential primary to Hillary Clinton, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed that ""it is not good enough to save some of these jobs. Trump made a promise that he would save all of these jobs, and we cannot rest until an ironclad contract is signed to ensure that all of these workers are able to continue working in Indiana."" Republican Representative Justin Amish of Michigan tweeted: ""Not the president(elect)'s job. We live in a constitutional republic, not an autocracy. Business-specific meddling shouldn't be normalized."" Reuters reported earlier this week that United Technologies would still would proceed with plans to close its Huntington, Indiana United Technologies Electronic Controls plant that employs 700.Trump also faces pressure to prevent other job cuts. There are several other factories in Indiana that closing and Senator Joe Donnelly, a Indiana Democrat, urged him to take action to prevent other job losses. The United States has shed about 5 million manufacturing jobs since 2000. Indiana alone has lost about 150,000 factory jobs since 2000 to about 500,000.

432,"   By David Shepardson | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), parent company of Carrier Corp, got a ""good deal"" with President-elect Donald Trump that allowed it to shift most jobs at two Indiana plants to Mexico, its chief executive said on Monday in an interview with CNBC.Greg Hayes, chief executive of UTC, said Trump did not make threats in negotiations over the plant's future or raise the company's U.S. military contracts. Carrier, which in February had announced plans to close two Indiana plants and send 2,100 jobs to Mexico, agreed last week to keep its Indianapolis plant open and keep about 1,100 jobs in the state, including 800 at the plant. It did not change its decision to close its Huntington plant.""I was born at night but not last night,"" Hayes told CNBC. ""I also know that about 10 percent of our revenue comes from the U.S. government. And I know that a better regulatory environment, a lower tax rate can eventually help UTC over the long run. And so we weighed all of things in making the decision with the board.""UTC, which had revenue of $56 billion in 2015 and owns Pratt & Whitney, has significant U.S. military contracts. Trump, who repeatedly threatened during the presidential campaign to impose a 35 percent tax on companies that moved jobs overseas, announced a deal last week in which UTC agreed to keep the Indianapolis plant open and invest at least $16 million in it. Indiana officials said UTC would receive up to $7 million in state tax incentives.""We keep the plant open, we keep 1,100 people employed in Indianapolis. We still get to do the preponderance of the restructuring, which we were going to do anyways,"" Hayes told CNBC, calling it a ""a good deal for UTC."" Hayes said there was ""no quid pro quo"" and said Trump did not tell him he would not impose taxes if the plant was kept open. ""He simply said, 'Take a hard look at it,'"" Hayes said.Hayes said the $16 million investment will help automate the plant ""to drive the cost down so that we can continue to be competitive. Now is it as cheap as moving to Mexico with lower cost labor? No.""Hayes said the company's military contracts did not come up in talks with Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence, the Indiana governor. Wayne Ranick, a spokesman for the United Steelworkers union, said the deal means that 730 union workers at the Indianapolis plant will keep their jobs and about 80 salaried workers. But work on fan coil manufacturing ""is still going to Mexico, affecting about 600 employees.""The nearly 1,100 jobs also includes retaining about 300 jobs at Carrier's Indiana headquarters that were not scheduled to go Mexico.
