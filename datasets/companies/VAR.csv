The court also awarded $9.2 million in legal fees.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the earlier finding that the infringement was willful on one portion of the patent, also called a claim. A court can triple damages if infringement is found to be willful.The appeals court also questioned the district court's reading of a second claim. It vacated the damages award based on that claim and sent it back to the lower court for reconsideration.

3,"  BRUSSELS, Sept 11 Philips and Belgium's Ion Beam Applications announced a partnership on Thursday designed to combine IBA's cancer-therapy technology with Philips' medical imaging systems.The two companies said in a joint statement that their collaboration would cover sales, marketing, research and development and include equipping molecular imaging centres.The partnership mirrors one struck in 2012 between Varian Medical Systems and Siemens Healthcare, the latter making imaging systems as well as particle accelerators. IBA is concentrated on equipping proton therapy centres, which offer a more targeted treatment of tumours than traditional radiotherapy. It holds a narrow majority of the market in proton systems, with rivals including Varian, Hitachi and Mitsubishi Electric. It has previously worked with a number of imaging systems companies, including Philips.(Reporting by Philip Blenkinsop; editing by Jason Neely)",2014-09-11,VAR,"Thu Sep 11, 2014 | 2:49am EDT","Philips, IBA strike partnership deal for cancer centres",http://www.reuters.com//article/philips-iba-idUSL5N0RC0SZ20140911?type=companyNews

Call options give the right to buy shares at a fixed price at a future date and provide a relatively cheap way to profit from a rally in shares.
