0,"   By Adam Jourdan | SHANGHAI  SHANGHAI Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the world's largest retailer, has recalled donkey meat sold at some outlets in China after tests showed the product contained the DNA of other animals, the U.S. company said.Wal-Mart will reimburse customers who bought the tainted ""Five Spice"" donkey meat and is helping local food and industry agencies in eastern Shandong province investigate its Chinese supplier, it said late on Wednesday in official posts on China's Twitter-like Weibo. The Shandong Food and Drug Administration earlier said the product contained fox meat.The scandal could dent Wal-Mart's reputation for quality in China's $1 trillion food and grocery market where it plans to open 110 new stores in the next few years. China is the largest grocery market in the world and is set to grow to $1.5 trillion by 2016, according to the Institute of Grocery Distribution.""This is another hit on Wal-Mart's brand, meaning wealthy shoppers will start to lose the trust they had before,"" said Shaun Rein, Shanghai-based managing director of China Market Research (CMR) Group. CMR estimates Wal-Mart's market share fell from 7.5 percent to 5.2 percent over the last three years.Donkey meat is a popular snack in some areas of China, although it only accounts for a tiny fraction of overall meat consumption. In 2011 China slaughtered 2.4 million donkeys, according to country's livestock industry yearbook. TRACK RECORD Wal-Mart, French grocer Carrefour SA, McDonald's Corp and KFC-parent Yum Brands Inc among others, have come under fire before in China over food safety issues, a sensitive topic in a country riddled with scares from a fatal tainted milk scandal to recycled ""gutter oil"" used for cooking.Wal-Mart said it had set up an investigation team to look into the incident, would strengthen food safety rules and take legal action against the product supplier. It added the person in charge at the supplier factory had already been detained. ""We are deeply sorry for this whole affair,"" said Wal-Mart's China president and CEO, Greg Foran. ""It is a deep lesson (for us) that we need to continue to increase investment in supplier management.""The U.S. retailer has had a troubled past in China. In 2011, China fined Wal-Mart, along with Carrefour, a combined 9.5 million yuan ($1.57 million) for manipulating product prices. Wal-Mart was also fined that year in China for selling duck meat past its expiry date.Food safety scandals can have a significant impact in China. Yum has struggled to recover sales in China more than a year after a chicken supplier to KFC in the country was found to have used excess levels of antibiotics.

3,"  LONDON Jan 6 Asda, the British arm of U.S. grocer Wal-Mart Stores, said it enjoyed a good performance at Christmas both in store and online.The supermarket, battling with J Sainsbury to be Britain's second largest grocer, is not scheduled to release its trading figures for its fourth quarter until Feb. 20.However, it said on Monday it was confident its strategy for Christmas was the right one.""Our strategy was to focus on gimmick-free, simple every day low price transparency for our customers and to hold our nerve when it came to the sales,"" it said.""This was against the backdrop of many other retailers vouchering heavily and starting their sales early, and resulted in us seeing record footfall over the Christmas period."" Britain's big grocers traditionally cope better in tough times thanks to their focus on essential goods. But with consumers' disposable incomes still being squeezed by wage rises not keeping up with inflation they are finding growth hard to achieve.Market leader Tesco will update on the six weeks to Jan. 4 on Thursday, while Sainsbury will report third-quarter sales on Wednesday. Tesco is forecast to report a fall in UK sales at stores open over a year, excluding fuel and VAT sales tax, of 0.5-2.5 percent, while Sainsbury's is expected to post like-for-like sales in a range of flat to down 1 percent.Asda said on Dec. 23 a record 4.8 million customers passed through its 573 UK stores, and it also had its biggest ever online Christmas, with grocery home shopping sales on Dec. 21 and Dec. 22 exceeding 5 million pounds ($8.2 million) for the first and second time. The firm also noted that 28 percent of grocery home shopping sales were ordered through its smartphone app in December, while mobile app sales were up over 200 percent on last year.Asda said in November that over the next five years it would invest 1 billion pounds in prices and 250 million pounds in improving product quality, seeking to expand its 17 percent share of the UK grocery market and counter the growing threat of discounters Aldi and LidlAsda's third quarter like-for-like sales rose 0.3 pct.",2014-01-06,WMT,"Mon Jan 6, 2014 | 3:16am EST",Asda says 'no gimmicks' Christmas strategy pays off,http://www.reuters.com//article/asda-christmas-idUSL6N0KG0HR20140106?type=companyNews
4,"   By Nandita Bose and Ruma Paul | DHAKA  DHAKA On the outskirts of Dhaka, Babylon Garments has shortened work shifts to eight hours from the usual 10 and plans to shutter production lines as months of election-related violence disrupts transport and prompts global retailers to curb orders.The company, which supplies shirts, trousers and other apparel for global retailers including Wal-Mart Inc, is one of the biggest players in Bangladesh's $22 billion garment industry that has seen orders cut nearly in half in the last three months - the worst drop in two decades, according to the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers & Exporters Association (BGMEA).""December is usually a season when we are packed with orders to a point where we can't take any more but look at this year - it's a completely different story,"" said Muhammad Saiful Hoque, assistant general manager of Babylon Garments, as workers sewed checked shirts for British-based Tesco Plc.Industry officials say the unrest in the run-up to Sunday's disputed election has been worse for business than the April collapse of Rana Plaza, an illegally built factory in which more than 1,100 workers were killed in a disaster that prompted calls for safer working conditions and more accountability on the part of the global retailers that buy Bangladesh's clothing exports.The disruption to Bangladesh's garment industry, the world's second biggest after China, as well as a shutdown by striking garment workers in Cambodia, another big supplier, means global retailers face a supply squeeze.Garment orders are typically placed at least three months in advance.""The impact won't be immediately felt but the delay in shipping finished orders will hurt the global retail market around June,"" said Shahidullah Azim, vice president of the BGMEA, which says up to $1 billion in orders are at risk in the coming weeks if the situation does not improve.A Wal-Mart spokesman said the country sources from more than 70 countries, which allows it to plan for any potential supply chain interruptions. He said he was not aware of any issues related to developments in Bangladesh and Cambodia.Michael J. Silverstein, a senior partner with the Boston Consulting Group based in Chicago, said Bangladesh is a critical supplier of clothing for world markets and too large to replace.""The majority of the customers believe Bangladesh will not go dark, for example stop shipping,"" he said. ""They do believe there will be delays and a need for alternative supplies.""CRUCIAL INDUSTRY Bangladesh's garment industry accounts for 80 percent of the country's exports and is so important to the economy that it has typically been spared from the political unrest that periodically racks the South Asian nation, even though many textile tycoons are politically active. Several factory owners are members of parliament, representing either the ruling Awami League or the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), which boycotted the poll in protest at Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's refusal to hand power to a neutral caretaker government to oversee the vote.More than 100 people were killed in clashes ahead of the election, with the unrest accompanied by roadblocks that have pushed up transport costs by 10 to 20 percent, according to the BGMEA - a worry for an industry that operates on wafer-thin margins and needs to keep costs low to be competitive.The unrest had shown no signs of abating since Sunday's poll, with seven people killed in further violence on Monday and one reported death on Tuesday, during a 48-hour strike called by the opposition after the poll.AKH Group, a large supplier that produces for H&M Hennes & Mauritz AB, Marks & Spencer Plc and Fast Retailing's Uniqlo, said it was becoming nearly impossible to meet delivery commitments.""Trucks are stuck on the roads for days and there is very little you can do about it other than somehow pay through the roof to get them going,"" AKH Group's Deputy Managing Director Abul Kashem said.Some shipments are costing the company as much as 1 million taka ($13,000), compared with the 20,000-30,000 taka it usually takes to send the same truckloads, as transport costs have surged due to roadblocks across the country, Kashem said. Buyers have cut orders by 25 percent on average and H&M, one of AKH's biggest clients, has cut its orders by 30 percent, he said. H&M, however, said it had not cut orders with AKH by 30 percent, and so far has not been affected by the unrest.The reason for the discrepancy was not immediately clear, although supply chains in Bangladesh are often complex, involving a series of buyers and middlemen.Analysts at Morningstar said in a note that H&M had protected itself well from potential disruptions by using a large number of manufacturers and ordering in small batches.A Marks & Spencer said the British high street stalwart was closely watching the situation in Bangladesh and Cambodia, but had not reduced orders and at this stage did not anticipate any effect on supplies. A Uniqlo spokesman said the company had not reduced production or orders from Bangladesh.LOST ORDERS Neighboring India has taken most of the orders that have been lost, while the rest have gone to Pakistan and China, according to data from the BGMEA. ""Rana Plaza dealt a heavy blow to the reputation of this country but that still didn't impact the confidence of buyers and inflow of orders the way the recent crisis has,"" said Babylon's Hoque.Babylon's production of shirts fell to 750,000 pieces in December from 850,000 in the same period last year, and was expected to fall below 700,000 by February due to the lack of demand, he said.Of the 12 large retailers Babylon supplies, seven or eight were placing orders in reduced quantities, while the rest have completely stopped, he said.If deliveries are late, the supplier must pay compensation, said Rubana Huq, managing director of Mohammadi Group, which supplies Wal-Mart, H&M, Inditex's Zara and others.""I have just paid 12,000 euros to a client. Our goods were three weeks late. I couldn't afford not to,"" she said.Inditex declined comment on the situation in Bangladesh.With as much as half of capacity idle at big factories, small manufacturers who make up a third of the industry and largely rely on subcontracted orders from bigger suppliers are especially vulnerable.Turja Apparel, a small garment factory in Dhaka, has no orders after January 20 and owner Kazi Babul was not hopeful he would get new ones until the political situation stabilizes.He said he may shutter his factory for now.""Small factory owners have suffered heavily after the Rana Plaza collapse as no one wants to give us orders, and now the political situation has taken away the little that we were getting.""($1=77.75 taka)(Additional reporting by Serajul Quadir in Dhaka, Phil Wahba in New York, Sophie Knight in Tokyo, James Davey in London and Emma Thomasson in Berlin Editing by Tony Munroe and Alex Richardson)",2014-01-08,WMT,"Wed Jan 8, 2014 | 11:50am EST",Bangladesh election unrest squeezes key garment sector,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-bangladesh-garments-idUSBREA070NF20140108?type=companyNews

7,"  * Sales rise 3.6 percent in Nov-Dec; expects 2.5-3 percent next FY* Sees profit of $4.40-4.50/shr next FY vs $3.87 analyst view* New jobs at online arm to offset 1.4 percent cut in U.S. workforceBy Phil WahbaJan 8 Department store operator Macy's Inc  on Wednesday reported strong holiday season sales and gave a preliminary forecast for 2014 that suggests it would continue to outpace its rivals. The retailer also announced plans to cut about 2,500 jobs, or 1.4 percent of its U.S. workforce, but said it expects to add positions for its growing online business, leaving overall staffing levels unchanged at around 175,000. Its shares rose 5 percent after the bell.Macy's said comparable sales, which include online sales and sales at stores open at least a year, rose 3.6 percent in November and December, roughly the same pace as in the third quarter, when it easily outperformed rivals from Kohl's Corp  and J.C. Penney Co Inc to Target Corp  and Wal-Mart Stores Inc in terms of sales growth. Data firm ShopperTrak on Wednesday said holiday season sales at stores rose 2.7 percent across the industry.Macy's, which also operates the high-end Bloomingdale's chain, forecast a profit of $4.40 to $4.50 per share for next fiscal year, while analysts were only expecting $3.87, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S/. Macy's expects comparable sales to grow 2.5 percent to 3 percent next fiscal year, which starts in February. The job cuts were part of a new cost-cutting plan that is expected to save the retailer about $100 million annually. That would include combining some store districts and some jobs at its central office.Macy's expects to incur charges of between $120 million and $135 million this quarter for the cost-cutting plan. In addition to benefitting from brisk luxury sales that lifted business at Bloomingdale's, Macy's has been able to gain an advantage over rivals Penney and Kohl's by using hundreds of its stores to help it fill online orders. It was also more aggressive in wooing shoppers on a more modest budget during the holiday season, helping it compete in the most discount-driven season since the recession.Going into the fall and holiday season, Macy's increased its selection of lower-priced items and boosted advertising and in-store signage during sales events to tout its least-expensive merchandise. Macy's, which caters to a middle-class clientele, offers a broad range merchandise, from $10 cotton T-shirts to Louis Vuitton handbags.At least one analyst said Macy's appeared likely to have been able to offer discounts to shoppers during the holidays without sacrificing its gross profit margin.""We are encouraged by the strength in sales early in the quarter, which were likely at high margin,"" Stifel Nicolaus analyst Richard Jaffe wrote in a note.",2014-01-09,WMT,"Wed Jan 8, 2014 | 10:26pm EST","UPDATE 1-Macy's posts strong holiday season sales, gives upbeat 2014 outlook",http://www.reuters.com//article/macys-results-idUSL2N0KJ0H520140109?type=companyNews

Last month, Britain's Tesco was the first to take the plunge, announcing it would buy a 50 percent stake in Trent Hypermarket Ltd, which is part of the Tata group.The decision by the newly-formed Common Man party government in Delhi to shut out foreign supermarkets could further dampen investor appetite.

17,"   By Carlyn Kolker and Kevin Drawbaugh | NEW YORK/WASHINGTON  NEW YORK/WASHINGTON A challenge by the U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to Wal-Mart Stores Inc's treatment of striking workers is likely to become a critical symbol of labor unions' attempts to organize the many non-union workplaces in the United States in the face of stiff resistance from management.The wider implications of the showdown for Wal-Mart and other American employers that don't recognize unions are likely to be much more important than any costs the giant retailer may face if it loses the case, labor experts said.The NLRB, which oversees union elections and polices unfair labor practices, issued a complaint on Wednesday accusing Wal-Mart of violating labor law by firing or disciplining workers for strikes over wages last year in 14 states.The NLRB's complaint breaks new ground for the agency, which is bringing more cases involving non-union workers as it asserts its role in an increasingly non-union economy. Wal-Mart is the largest employer to face such a complaint in years.""This is part of a drive by the NLRB to further police employees' labor rights in the non-unionized workforce,"" said Paul Secunda, a professor of labor law at Marquette University.""If the NLRB can go after Wal-Mart and be successful, that sends a shot across the bow to all employers across the line - to employers that are similar in size, to smaller employers - that they are under the jurisdiction of the NLRB,"" he said.In addition, the Wal-Mart case weaves together complaints on behalf of 19 fired workers, as opposed to handling one complaint at a time. That makes it ""precedent-setting,"" said Sarita Gupta of Jobs With Justice, a workers' rights group.If a settlement is not reached, the agency's case is likely to drag on for two to three years as it winds its way through agency proceedings and then up to a U.S. court of appeals.""In this procedural step taken by the NLRB, Walmart looks forward to the opportunity to shed some light on the facts of the case,"" Wal-Mart spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan said in a statement.""We believe we acted respectfully and most importantly lawfully. Walmart has a strict no retaliation policy and the associates who are included in the complaint were not terminated for participating or membership in an outside group, but rather for violations of other policies including attendance.""An NLRB spokesman did not return a call seeking comment. OLD ENEMIES Behind the clash is an ongoing struggle over the future of the American workplace between businesses and unions. Arkansas-based Wal-Mart and organized labor are old enemies, with the retailer determined to keep its U.S. workforce non-union, while unions try to make inroads among Wal-Mart's 1.3 million American employees, many of whom are lower paid.Between the two sides is the labor board, which is flexing its muscles again under Democratic President Barack Obama but is powerless to seek big fines against Wal-Mart.""A victory for the board and the union could have symbolic importance for unionizing drives across the country,"" said Michael Gold, a professor of labor law at Cornell University.""Just the opposite is true - if Wal-Mart wins the case, they are really going to trumpet it. They are going to tell their workers, with good cause, 'we did not break the law. The government persecuted us for nothing,'"" he said. U.S. unions have been helping Wal-Mart workers push for better pay and benefits. In November 2012, protests occurred at Walmart stores nationwide. They resumed in early 2013, as picketers and workers demanded better working conditions in Texas, Florida, Illinois and California.The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW) and a group known as Organization United for Respect at Walmart, or OUR Walmart, have assisted the strikers and brought allegations of unfair labor practices to the NLRB.LONG PROCESS Wal-Mart has until January 28 to respond to the NLRB complaint, which was brought by the general counsel's office of the agency.After the response, Wal-Mart and the NLRB would participate in a trial-like proceeding before an agency administrative law judge. Any decision by that judge would be reviewed by three of the five board members of the NLRB, the top officials at the agency, based in Washington. Board members are presidentially appointed; three are Democrats and two are Republicans.If the board members find an unfair labor practice has occurred, they will issue an order against Wal-Mart, but they must go to an appellate court to enforce it. The NLRB has little power to extract much from Wal-Mart. It cannot fine the company. The agency could require payment of back-pay for the workers, reinstatement for lost jobs and request that the company post notices about workers' rights.""By Wal-Mart's standards it's not likely to be a lot of money,"" said Julius Getman, a labor law professor at the University of Texas.But Wal-Mart will likely fight the case because ""it's a cost of doing business and staying non-union,"" he said.At almost any stage in this process, the NLRB and Wal-Mart could reach a settlement that would halt further proceedings.No matter how long it plays out, the case will not only be a test for Wal-Mart, but for the NLRB and organized labor's attempts to adjust itself to an economy based less and less on factory workers and more and more on service employees.The portion of all U.S. workers belonging to a union fell to 11.3 percent in 2012, compared with 20.1 percent in 1983, according to the latest data from the U.S. Department of Labor. In the private sector, only 6.6 percent were union members in 2012.As union membership has dwindled, the NLRB has increasingly tackled cases involving non-unionized workers. Secunda cited cases involving private-sector workers using social media to organize against employers, including a 2012 decision involving Costco Wholesale Corp's social media policy.Private employers will be watching the case, said Richard Block, an attorney with law firm Mintz Levin Cohn Ferris Glovsky and Popeo who represents companies in labor disputes.""It's all about the union drive, as opposed to the particular facts,"" said Block. ""It's bigger than the particular facts.""(Additional reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Amy Stevens, Martin Howell and Ken Wills)",2014-01-17,WMT,"Thu Jan 16, 2014 | 10:35pm EST",Analysis: Wal-Mart case seen a key test in struggle over labor rights,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-walmart-labor-analysis-idUSBREA0G05F20140117?type=companyNews

Wal-Mart operates more than 400 stores and warehouses in China and competes with market leaders Sun Art Retail Group Ltd  and China Resources Enterprise Ltd, which in August teamed up with Britain's Tesco.This is not the first time Wal-Mart has had trouble with Chinese authorities. In 2011, China fined Wal-Mart, along with France's Carrefour, a combined 9.5 million yuan ($1.6 million) for manipulating product prices.Wal-Mart was also fined that year in China for selling duck meat past its expiry date.Earlier this year, the U.S. group apologised after a Chinese supplier of donkey meat snacks was found to have mixed fox meat into the product.",2014-01-24,WMT,"Fri Jan 24, 2014 | 7:01am EST",Chinese state TV criticises Wal-Mart's quality control,http://www.reuters.com//article/china-walmart-idUSL2N0KY0CX20140124?type=companyNews

27,"   By Lucia Mutikani | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Rising household spending and exports likely pushed the U.S. economy ahead at a decent clip in the fourth quarter, building a foundation for stronger growth this year.Gross domestic product probably grew at a 3.2 percent annual rate, according to a Reuters survey of economists. While that expansion would be a step back from the third quarter's brisk 4.1 percent pace, its composition is expected to be healthier.More of the growth should come from final demand and less from an accumulation of stocks in warehouses, although a further increase in inventories is expected.""Consumer spending was one of the solid supports. The other was on the inventory front,"" said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.In the third quarter, inventories rose $115.7 billion, adding 1.67 percentage points to GDP growth, and many economists expected an effort to sell off those stocks to bring growth to a sub-2-percent pace in the fourth quarter.But a jump in consumer spending made the third quarter inventory build look prescient.""A lot of people were expecting to see a swing the other way of the same magnitude. That has proven not to be the case,"" Bullard said.Consumer spending is expected to be the main driver of fourth-quarter growth, but other segments of the economy such as trade and business investment are also seen lending a hand. The Commerce Department will release its first snapshot of fourth-quarter GDP at 8:30 a.m. (1330 GMT) on Thursday, a day after the Federal Reserve wraps up a two-day policy meeting.The Fed gave the economy a vote of confidence last month, announcing it would start to scale back its hefty monthly bond purchases. It is expected to announce another reduction to the program on Wednesday despite some recent weak data, including reports on December employment and durable goods orders.""We expect the Fed to stay the course on tapering, reducing purchases by a further $10 billion per month, as they are likely to look through the recent spate of disappointing economic reports,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.CONSUMER SPENDING TO SHINE  Consumer spending was forecast to have risen at a pace as fast as 4 percent, which would be the strongest in three years. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased at a 2 percent pace in the third quarter.Despite the anticipated spending surge, inflation pressures likely remained benign. A price index in the GDP report is expected to have risen at a 0.7 percent rate, decelerating from the third-quarter's 1.9 percent pace.A core measure that strips out food and energy costs likely rose at a 1.1 percent rate after increasing at a 1.4 percent pace in the July-September period.""It's really hard to get inflation without seeing any upside pressure on wages, and to get that you need to see a considerable decline and tightening in the jobs market,"" said Jacob Oubina, a senior economist at RBC Capital Markets in New York. Trade likely also gave growth a lift, thanks to firmer global growth and declining petroleum imports, which narrowed the trade deficit. The United States is ramping up domestic energy production, reducing its dependency of foreign oil.Business spending on equipment likely accelerated after rising only at a 0.2 percent pace in the third quarter. However, a report on Tuesday showing orders for capital goods, excluding defense and aircraft, dropped in December suggested it would cool.""We might see a pullback in whatever growth we are going to see from equipment in the fourth quarter. That's going to be a headwind to first-quarter growth,"" said Wells Fargo Securities' Bullard.Even so, a lessening of the fiscal austerity that gripped Washington last year should keep the economy on a firmer growth path. Growth for the whole of this year is forecast at 2.9 percent, up from last year's estimated 1.9 percent.Some moderation is expected in business spending on nonresidential structures in the fourth quarter.A drop in brokers' commissions tied to softer home sales over the summer and weak spending on home improvements could see residential investment falling for the first time since the third quarter of 2010, even though homebuilding looked well maintained.Government spending likely fell, reflecting a 16-day partial shutdown of the federal government in October.(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by James Dalgleish)",2014-01-28,WMT,"Tue Jan 28, 2014 | 4:33pm EST","Consumers, trade seen boosting fourth-quarter growth",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-economy-gdp-idUSBREA0R1SJ20140128?type=companyNews

Graham, a Republican, is up for re-election this year.Robertson, 41, is a son of ""Duck Dynasty"" patriarch Phil Robertson, who was temporarily suspended from the hit show by cable television network A&E last month for making anti-gay remarks in a magazine interview. Other quotes in the interview were criticized as racist. Phil Robertson's suspension sparked a national debate over tolerance and religion, with several Republican politicians and conservative figures coming to his defense.The patriarch, who never apologized for his remarks, was reinstated after fans protested and big-name corporate sponsors stuck by the show. Willie Robertson is the chief executive officer of Duck Commander, a family-run business that specializes in duck-hunting gear and whose family's life is the subject of ""Duck Dynasty,"" which averages about 8 million viewers per episode. The show is in its fifth season.CEO Robertson supported and endorsed McAllister in November during the Louisiana politician's successful campaign in a special election for a vacant congressional seat in the Pelican State's Fifth District.

The European Central Bank responded by cutting its interest rates to record lows.An unexpected drop in euro-zone inflation raises pressure on the ECB to consider fresh policy action next week to counter deflation risks and support a weak euro-zone recovery that may be faltering.Meanwhile, U.S. consumer sentiment dipped slightly in January, with recent economic improvement not translating into expectations for future gains, according to Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan data.Another report showed U.S. labor costs rose in the fourth quarter, but there was still little sign of wage inflation amid slack in the job market.",2014-01-31,WMT,"Fri Jan 31, 2014 | 2:10pm EST",US STOCKS-Wall St sags; S&P eyes first monthly loss since August,http://www.reuters.com//article/markets-usa-stocks-idUSL2N0L51C720140131?type=companyNews
34,"  MUMBAI Feb 1 The government of India's western state of Rajasthan has barred foreign direct investment in the multi-brand retail sector, newspapers  said, becoming the second state to block foreign supermarkets from setting up shop.Last month, the newly-elected Aam Aadmi (Common Man) Party government in the capital, New Delhi barred foreign supermarkets, opposing the efforts of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to attract overseas investment and revive the economy. Singh had thrown open the country's $500-billion retail industry to foreign investors late in 2012, allowing companies such as Wal-Mart Stores and TESCO Plc to own majority stakes in Indian chains for the first time. So far, fewer than half of India's 28 states have agreed to roll out the policy. The decision by Rajasthan, ruled by the country's main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), comes just months ahead of national elections that are due to be completed by May 2014.",2014-02-01,WMT,"Sat Feb 1, 2014 | 2:17am EST",India's Rajasthan state bars entry of foreign supermarkets,http://www.reuters.com//article/india-retail-idUSL3N0L604U20140201?type=companyNews
35,"   By Ryan Vlastelica | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Investors may crave a quiet market this coming week to digest the recent volatility in stocks and rehash Sunday's Super Bowl, but the prospect doesn't look likely.The catalysts that drove the Dow and the S&P 500 to their worst monthly performances since May 2012 have not gone away. The retreat from emerging markets - and stocks in general - appears to have more room to run as the factors that helped propel the market to record highs in mid-January aren't providing enough support.Calls for a market correction have become louder, with the S&P 500 down 3.6 percent from its all-time closing high and the Federal Reserve's announcement on Wednesday that it will keep trimming its monthly bond buying.More than 80 S&P 500 components are set to report earnings next week, but the myriad issues surrounding emerging markets remain at the forefront for investors.""Bad news in any area of the globe is bound to make sentiment less positive in others. This isn't an issue of contagion, but there will be influence,"" said John Chisholm, chief investment officer of the Boston-based Acadian Asset Management, which has an emerging market equity fund with $1.2 billion in assets. ""There's plenty more instability ahead.""While countries such as Turkey and South Africa have taken steps to stabilize their currencies, the trend has remained negative for those assets.The CBOE Volatility Index .VIX, a measure of investor anxiety, rose 34.2 percent during January to end the month at 18.41, after wrapping up 2013 at 13.72. The VIX remains below the long-term average of  20, however, and has not traded above 19 since October.For the month of January, the Dow fell 5.3 percent and the S&P 500 lost 3.6 percent - marking their worst monthly percentage declines since May 2012. The Nasdaq fell 1.7 percent in January, its worst month since October 2012.It's tempting to believe that U.S. stocks are a salve for this pain. But the reality is that when emerging markets swoon, U.S. stocks decline as well, just not as much. Goldman Sachs analysts wrote last week that when MSCI's emerging markets index .MSCIEF falls at least 5 percent, the S&P 500 .SPX tends to fall by half of that. The MSCI index has dropped 11 percent since an October peak of 1,047.73.""Our EM strategists believe some EM equity markets have further to fall, and that they require significant current account rebalancing before bottoming,"" Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note about their outlook on emerging markets.The effect on U.S. companies is harder to discern. Goldman estimated that S&P 500 companies derive 5 percent of their profits from emerging markets, with some sectors more affected than others.Among the companies with large emerging markets exposure set to report earnings next week are General Motors (GM.N) and Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N). Yum, in fact, gets more than half of its sales from the ""BRIC"" nations - Brazil, Russia, India and China. Yum's stock lost 11.2 percent in January, while GM shares dropped 11.7 percent.Both stocks, along with the shares of other internationally exposed companies, have underperformed the S&P 500 since the Fed first said it would cut back on its stimulus on December 18. Demand in China has been particularly sluggish, which affected Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) results, as the company's iPhone sales were worse than expected, and Wal-Mart Stores (WMT.N), which closed some locations in that country, as well as in Brazil.Some are still looking to buy, though.""We'd need to see more significant hits from overseas exposure before we start paring away our allocation to those names ... GM is doing well because of its EM exposure,"" Acadian's Chisholm said.'BEST HOUSE' IN A POOR NEIGHBORHOOD  With half of the S&P 500 companies having reported earnings so far, almost 70 percent have topped earnings expectations, above the long-term average of 63 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Two-thirds have exceeded estimates on revenue, above the historical average of 61 percent, though companies have generally been meeting or beating lowered expectations.""While there are equity risks, there's very little risk from a bear market standpoint,"" said Jim Dunigan, chief investment officer of PNC Wealth Management in Philadelphia. ""That markets have held on as well as they have shows that equity appetite still exists.""Whether there is conviction behind the buying is debatable. The three busiest days for the market in terms of the S&P's E-mini futures contract, the most heavily traded equity futures contract, were Wednesday, Monday, and last Friday, January 24 - all of which were selloffs.Still, investors keep pouring money into stock market funds, with $10.24 billion added in the week ended January 29, according to Thomson Reuters' Lipper service. This marked the sixth straight week of net new cash.The S&P 500 is about 0.5 percent above its 100-day moving average, a level that could provide support against further losses. According to the most recent Reuters poll of analysts, the benchmark index is expected to end the year at 1,925 - about 8 percent away from current levels.Dunigan, who helps oversee $127 billion in assets, said that stocks remain ""the best house in a bad neighborhood,"" especially with U.S. interest rates low.""When you look at the alternatives, fixed income continues to look risky, and cash doesn't help you,"" he said. ""Unlike other asset classes, equities will still get boosts from contributions like buybacks, merger activity and capital expenditures.""(Wall St Week Ahead runs every Friday.

43,"   By Phil Wahba  The struggles of the low-income U.S. consumer are playing out in Wal-Mart Stores Inc's grocery aisles.The world's largest retailer, which gets more than half its sales from groceries, on Thursday gave a disappointing full-year forecast. It blamed sharp cuts in food stamp benefits and higher payroll taxes that are will hit disposable income for its core customers. Wal-Mart shares fell 2.2 percent in morning trading.To combat sluggish sales, broaden its customer base and fend off aggressive rivals, Wal-Mart said it was doubling the number of smaller new stores it originally planned to open this year.Wal-Mart's U.S. comparable sales, e-commerce and sales at stores open at least a year, fell for the fourth quarter in a row, slammed by a drop in its grocery business and aggressive price cuts during a tough holiday shopping season.The smaller stores, typically one quarter the size of Wal-Mart's supercenters, allow the retailer to reach new customers, particularly in urban areas. They also appeal to shoppers who want to pick up groceries and other staples mid-week without making a trip to an enormous supercenter.""The smaller format is a way to address the problems at grocery, but it's going to take multiple years for it to have a positive impact on overall results,"" said Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough.Comparable sales at the smaller stores rose 5 percent last quarter, compared to an overall 0.4 percent drop in the United States.Wal-Mart now plans to open between 270 and 300 small stores this fiscal year, in addition to the 346 currently in operation, and is spending an extra $600 million to do so. It had planned to open 120 to 150 new small stores this year. Wal-Mart operates 4,000 super-centers. Expansion of Wal-Mart's e-commerce will also eat into this year's profits.The company expects net sales growth this year to come in at the low end of its forecast range of 3 to 5 percent.The cuts last year to benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the largest U.S. anti-hunger program, have been particularly painful for Wal-Mart. One in five Wal-Mart shoppers relies on food stamps, according to Cowen analyst Tal Lev. Wal-Mart also faces stiff competition from dollar stores for lower-income shoppers.During the quarter, comparable grocery sales fell by a ""low-single-digit"" percentage. In contrast, higher-end supermarket operators Kroger Co and Safeway Inc reported increases for their most recent quarters. Wal-Mart shares fell 2.2 percent to $73.21 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.SPEND MONEY TO MAKE MONEY The retailer plans to increase its spending on integrating its stores with e-commerce, saying efforts such as using stores to fill online orders during the holiday season had been successful.E-commerce sales crossed the $10 billion threshold last fiscal year and the company is fighting Amazon.com Inc to win online shoppers.

44,"  (New throughout, adds details on grocery segment, comments from executives on media call)By Phil WahbaFeb 20 The struggles of the low-income U.S. consumer are playing out in Wal-Mart Stores Inc's  grocery aisles.The world's largest retailer, which gets more than half its sales from groceries, on Thursday gave a disappointing full-year forecast. It blamed sharp cuts in food stamp benefits and higher payroll taxes that are will hit disposable income for its core customers. Wal-Mart shares fell 2.2 percent in morning trading.To combat sluggish sales, broaden its customer base and fend off aggressive rivals, Wal-Mart said it was doubling the number of smaller new stores it originally planned to open this year.Wal-Mart's U.S. comparable sales, e-commerce and sales at stores open at least a year, fell for the fourth quarter in a row, slammed by a drop in its grocery business and aggressive price cuts during a tough holiday shopping season.The smaller stores, typically one quarter the size of Wal-Mart's supercenters, allow the retailer to reach new customers, particularly in urban areas. They also appeal to shoppers who want to pick up groceries and other staples mid-week without making a trip to an enormous supercenter.""The smaller format is a way to address the problems at grocery, but it's going to take multiple years for it to have a positive impact on overall results,"" said Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough.Comparable sales at the smaller stores rose 5 percent last quarter, compared to an overall 0.4 percent drop in the United States.Wal-Mart now plans to open between 270 and 300 small stores this fiscal year, in addition to the 346 currently in operation, and is spending an extra $600 million to do so. It had planned to open 120 to 150 new small stores this year. Wal-Mart operates 4,000 super-centers. Expansion of Wal-Mart's e-commerce will also eat into this year's profits.The company expects net sales growth this year to come in at the low end of its forecast range of 3 to 5 percent.The cuts last year to benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the largest U.S. anti-hunger program, have been particularly painful for Wal-Mart. One in five Wal-Mart shoppers relies on food stamps, according to Cowen analyst Tal Lev. Wal-Mart also faces stiff competition from dollar stores for lower-income shoppers.During the quarter, comparable grocery sales fell by a ""low-single-digit"" percentage. In contrast, higher-end supermarket operators Kroger Co and Safeway Inc  reported increases for their most recent quarters. Wal-Mart shares fell 2.2 percent to $73.21 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.SPEND MONEY TO MAKE MONEY  The retailer plans to increase its spending on integrating its stores with e-commerce, saying efforts such as using stores to fill online orders during the holiday season had been successful.E-commerce sales crossed the $10 billion threshold last fiscal year and the company is fighting Amazon.com Inc  to win online shoppers.Investment in both the small stores and e-commerce will hit profit, and the Wal-Mart said it expects earnings of $5.10 to $5.45 per share this year.

45,"   By James Davey | LONDON  LONDON Britain's economic recovery is fragile, with huge regional variations, the head of Asda supermarkets said on Thursday as the company reported flat sales over the key Christmas quarter.Andy Clarke, chief executive of the British arm of U.S. retailer Wal-Mart Stores (WMT.N), said he did not expect the regional disparities to change dramatically in 2014.""The economy is still fragile and so customers still feel very fragile,"" he told reporters.He said levels of disposable income were hugely dependent on which part of the country consumers lived in.""If you live in London and the south east and you've got 10 percent housing value growth then it feels very different than if you are in the northeast or Northern Ireland, where unemployment is still a big challenge,"" he said, noting an unexpected rise in UK joblessness in data published on Wednesday.Clarke was speaking after British finance minister George Osborne warned on Thursday that Britain's economic recovery was not secure. Asda, battling with J Sainsbury (SBRY.L) to be Britain's No. 2 grocery chain, said sales at stores open over a year, excluding fuel and VAT sales tax, fell 0.1 percent year on year for the 13 weeks to January 3, its fiscal fourth quarter, although it kept its gross margin steady.The sales performance represented a slowdown from like-for-like growth of 0.3 percent in the third quarter, further illustrating how tough Christmas was for Britain's major grocers.The UK's so called ""top four"" grocers, which also include market leader Tesco (TSCO.L) and No. 4 Morrisons (MRW.L), are struggling to hold their ground in the face of competition from hard discounters Aldi ALDIEI.UL and Lidl LIDUK.UL and upmarket players Waitrose JLP.UL and Marks & Spencer (MKS.L).Monthly data published last week by Kantar Worldpanel showed the slowest industry growth since 2005. Household incomes remain under pressure because inflation is still outstripping pay rises. Tesco and Morrisons both reported underlying sales falls for the Christmas period, while Sainsbury's eked out a small rise.Asda said in November it would spend over 1 billion pounds ($1.67 billion) on price cuts and product innovation and 250 million pounds on product quality, style and design over the next five years.""We're under no illusions as to the structural changes facing our sector and that is why we took early action to look at how we need to move our business forward,"" said Clarke. He said the firm ""invested"" over 60 million pounds in the fourth quarter to cut prices on basic items. In 2014, Asda plans to set aside 200 million pounds for price cuts and invest 750 million pounds in store openings, extensions and refurbishment.In 2013 Asda removed all short-term vouchering activity to focus more on price.""On all customers' minds is value and it is that value equation - it's not just about price at any cost, it's the combination of price and quality,"" said chief merchandising officer Barry Williams.""And they're becoming, in my experience, less and less interested in gimmicks.""Wal-Mart on Thursday reported lower profit for the holiday quarter as comparable U.S. sales fell again.(Reporting by James Davey; editing by Neil Maidment and Tom Pfeiffer)",2014-02-20,WMT,"Thu Feb 20, 2014 | 11:32am EST","UK's economic recovery fragile, warns Asda boss",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-asda-results-idUSBREA1J0YD20140220?type=companyNews

U.S. factory activity accelerated at its fastest pace in nearly four years in February, according to Markit's preliminary U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index, a bullish economic indicator following a string of weaker-than-expected reports.Investors have largely shrugged off tepid data, pinning recent weakness to the impact of unexpectedly cold weather rather than worsening fundamentals.However, stocks fell on Wednesday after comments from the Federal Reserve failed to reinforce the central bank's commitment to stimulating the economy despite the recent weakness.""The manufacturing data is extremely positive, especially coming after a spate of bad news at a time when the Fed seems committed to slowing stimulus,"" said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at the ConvergEx Group in New York. Wal-Mart Stores Inc was the Dow's bigger decliner, falling 2.4 percent to $73.07 after the world's biggest retailer reported a drop in U.S. same-store sales and gave an earnings outlook below expectations.Social networking giant Facebook said late Wednesday it would buy mobile-messaging startup WhatsApp for $16 billion in cash and stock, plus an additional $3 billion worth of restricted stock units to WhatsApp's founders.

Instead, it's focusing on private-label products and imports, putting its stamp on quality and safety.""We're closing some stores because we got enamored with growth,"" said Raymond Bracy, head of corporate affairs at Walmart China. ""We're not going to do that again. We're focusing on quality first.""Getting China right is crucial for Wal-Mart's international ambitions. The world's largest retailer ranks third in China behind Sun Art Retail Group Ltd and state-backed China Resources Enterprise Ltd, according to Euromonitor. Brazil and India are proving challenging, too.""If you went out and asked members or customers, 'What's your single biggest worry?' they'll tell you trust and authenticity,"" said Greg Foran, who took over as Walmart China CEO in 2012. ""Once you've got their trust, the next question they ask themselves is, 'How much is it?'""Walmart International, which contributes less than a third of net sales, has suffered from aggressive expansion and is a big concern for new CEO Doug McMillon, who previously led the international unit.The retailer on Thursday forecast lower full-year profit than analysts had expected for fiscal 2015.

Private labels typically price at 10-40 percent below local brands, but profit margins are higher for the retailer. They make up close to half of sales in Britain. Bracy said the retailer is rationalizing its supply chain in China and building its own distribution centers to manage quality, while also lowering costs. ""Our costs have come down so much on pork that people ask us, 'Gee, is it too low?' They wonder, 'Is it legitimate? Can we trust it?'"" he said.On an annual basis, Walmart International's revenue growth last fiscal year was the slowest in four years.MIXED MESSAGES Chinese consumers seek out large foreign brands for reliability and quality, said James Roy, an associate principal at Shanghai-based China Market Research.

Wal-Mart has previously exited markets such as Germany and South Korea where it's cheap prices and large stores model failed to work, but it has stuck it out in China, the world's second-largest economy, for nearly two decades, struggling with its brand positioning.Its international business has been under the spotlight after it was accused in 2012 of bribery in Mexico, its biggest business outside the United States. It later launched graft probes in China and Brazil and in India, where the investigation hit its first-mover advantage in a $500 billion market.The graft has less of an effect on the business in China, but food safety scandals - from fatal tainted milk to recycled 'gutter oil' used for cooking - have hurt it. In January, Wal-Mart recalled its popular ""Five Spice"" donkey meat after tests showed traces of fox meat.Food, especially fresh produce and meat, is an acknowledged traffic driver for Chinese hypermarkets, making it a bigger part of the retail equation than elsewhere.

51,"   By Phil Wahba  The struggles of the low-income U.S. consumer are playing out in Wal-Mart Stores Inc's (WMT.N) grocery aisles.The world's largest retailer, which gets more than half its sales from groceries, on Thursday gave a disappointing full-year forecast. It blamed sharp cuts in food stamp benefits and higher payroll taxes that are will hit disposable income for its core customers. Wal-Mart shares fell 2.2 percent in morning trading.To combat sluggish sales, broaden its customer base and fend off aggressive rivals, Wal-Mart said it was doubling the number of smaller new stores it originally planned to open this year.Wal-Mart's U.S. comparable sales, e-commerce and sales at stores open at least a year, fell for the fourth quarter in a row, slammed by a drop in its grocery business and aggressive price cuts during a tough holiday shopping season.The smaller stores, typically one quarter the size of Wal-Mart's supercenters, allow the retailer to reach new customers, particularly in urban areas. They also appeal to shoppers who want to pick up groceries and other staples mid-week without making a trip to an enormous supercenter.""The smaller format is a way to address the problems at grocery, but it's going to take multiple years for it to have a positive impact on overall results,"" said Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough.Comparable sales at the smaller stores rose 5 percent last quarter, compared to an overall 0.4 percent drop in the United States.Wal-Mart now plans to open between 270 and 300 small stores this fiscal year, in addition to the 346 currently in operation, and is spending an extra $600 million to do so. It had planned to open 120 to 150 new small stores this year. Wal-Mart operates 4,000 super-centers. Expansion of Wal-Mart's e-commerce will also eat into this year's profits.The company expects net sales growth this year to come in at the low end of its forecast range of 3 to 5 percent.The cuts last year to benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the largest U.S. anti-hunger program, have been particularly painful for Wal-Mart. One in five Wal-Mart shoppers relies on food stamps, according to Cowen analyst Tal Lev. Wal-Mart also faces stiff competition from dollar stores for lower-income shoppers.During the quarter, comparable grocery sales fell by a ""low-single-digit"" percentage. In contrast, higher-end supermarket operators Kroger Co (KR.N) and Safeway Inc SWY.N reported increases for their most recent quarters. Wal-Mart shares fell 2.2 percent to $73.21 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.SPEND MONEY TO MAKE MONEY The retailer plans to increase its spending on integrating its stores with e-commerce, saying efforts such as using stores to fill online orders during the holiday season had been successful.E-commerce sales crossed the $10 billion threshold last fiscal year and the company is fighting Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) to win online shoppers. Investment in both the small stores and e-commerce will hit profit, and the Wal-Mart said it expects earnings of $5.10 to $5.45 per share this year. Analysts expect about $5.54 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Overall revenue in the quarter through January 31, which included the key holiday season, grew 1.4 percent to $129.7 billion.Wal-Mart Chief Executive Doug McMillon, who took the reins this month, said the company would use ""price investment,"" company-speak for lower pricing, to revive U.S. sales.At its Sam's Club chain, comparable sales fell 0.1 percent, while rival Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) posted gains.Overseas, comparable sales fell in key markets such as Canada and Britain.The company earned $1.60 per share excluding items, down from $1.67 a year earlier, but one cent better than expected.(Reporting by Phil Wahba in New York; Editing by Jilian Mincer, Lisa Von Ahn, Bernadette Baum and David Gregorio)",2014-02-21,WMT,"Thu Feb 20, 2014 | 8:27pm EST",Wal-Mart forecast disappoints as grocery business struggles,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-walmart-results-idUSBREA1J0WX20140221?type=companyNews
52,"   By Rodrigo Campos  U.S. home price gains slowed in December, according to a closely watched housing survey on Tuesday that underscored a loss of momentum in the housing recovery, while consumer confidence drifted lower this month.The S&P/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index rose a seasonally adjusted 0.8 percent in December, down from a 0.9 percent rise in November. For the 12 months to December, prices were up 13.4 percent, below the peak of 13.7 percent in November and the first decline in the rate of change since June.""Recent housing data has shown that activity at the outset of 2014 has slowed down,"" said Jefferies economists in a note regarding the Case-Shiller gauge.""It is possible that the index has reached a near-term top."" Recent data have shown the housing recovery losing steam in the early part of the year. Housing starts dropped 16 percent in January, the biggest decline in almost three years, and home resales slid to a 1-1/2 year low last month.Bitter cold and serial snowstorms this winter have been blamed in part for the weakness in the housing sector, though analysts say higher mortgage rates and low inventories have hurt as well.On Tuesday, Toll Brothers, the largest U.S. luxury homebuilder, reported a fall in quarterly orders for the first time in three years as a severe winter deterred buyers. Home Depot's higher-than-expected profit came in as cost cuts offset weak sales. A Reuters poll showed U.S. home price inflation, as measured by the S&P/Case-Shiller index, is seen slowing to less than 7 percent this year as mortgage rates rise and there is a gradual transition away from a market driven by institutional buyers looking for bargains.A sentiment survey on Tuesday suggested consumers were wary of future economic conditions. Consumer confidence slipped in February, according to a private sector report. The Conference Board, an industry group, said its index of consumer attitudes fell to 78.1 from a downwardly revised 79.4 in January. Economists in a Reuters poll had expected 80.0.""While expectations have fluctuated over recent months, current conditions have continued to trend upward,"" Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at The Conference Board, said in a statement.""This suggests that consumers believe the economy has improved, but they do not foresee it gaining considerable momentum in the months ahead.""(Reporting by Rodrigo Campos; Additional reporting by Leah Schnurr and Luciana Lopez; Editing by Andrea Ricci)",2014-02-25,WMT,"Tue Feb 25, 2014 | 4:46pm EST","U.S. home price rise momentum weakens, consumer confidence falls",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-economy-confidence-idUSBREA1O15620140225?type=companyNews

""They need to be bolder and braver,"" he said.The overall approach to growth and returns set out last year remains the same, Clarke said, targeting mid-single-digit annual growth in trading profit, return on capital employed (ROCE) within a range of 12-15 percent and dividend growth broadly in line with underlying earnings, with a target cover of more than two times.Tesco, which makes about two thirds of its revenue in Britain, has suffered more than many rivals because it has more large stores and traditionally sold a higher proportion of large-ticket non-food items, such as domestic appliances, where shoppers cut back most in an economic downturn.To address that, Clarke has refocused the company's non-food offer on higher-margin categories, such as clothing and homewares, though only about a third of its huge Extra stores have been refurbished so far. Tesco said the Extra format will be a priority for 2014, with 110 slated for refits.CONVENIENCE STORES  Clarke also plans to open 150 convenience stores a year, while other initiatives include a planned doubling of click-and-collect locations and the expansion of a scheme allowing loyalty card holders to save money on fuel.The group, which trails France's Carrefour (CARR.PA) and U.S. giant Wal-Mart (WMT.N) in annual sales, also said it would reduce net new space significantly, resulting in lower overall capital expenditure.Having given guidance for net new UK space of about 1.4 million square feet for 2013/14, it plans a further reduction to 0.7 million sq ft in 2014/15.Group capital expenditure will drop to no more than 2.5 billion pounds a year, its lowest level for 10 years, for at least the next three financial years.

61,"   By Manoj Kumar | NEW DELHI  NEW DELHI Feb 27 Indian opposition candidate for prime minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday the country's millions of family-owned traders must learn to work with large modern shops and online retailers, in comments that could signal a shift in thinking.Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party opposes a policy to allow foreign supermarkets to open in India, which it says is a threat to millions of grocery stores and traders who are a backbone of the party's support.Sketching out his economic views ahead of a general election likely to be held in April and May, Modi declined to reiterate that stance or oppose a proposal to allow foreign investment in online shopping, which is growing rapidly in India.Instead, he said small traders should put emphasis on the quality of their products to compete better. He said they could enter into contracts with big online retailers to create ""virtual trade"".""We should not worry about the challenges from global trade,"" Modi told a meeting of the Confederation of All India Traders. ""The government should not look to curb online trade. We should not worry about these things, our children have taken IT to the world. We'll have to embrace it.""Modi, chief minister of the western state of Gujarat, is campaigning on the back of a record of strong growth over more than a decade in office. But he has given few details about  how he would steer the national economy, which has seen growth at its slowest in a decade.In some of the first detailed comments, the Hindu nationalist also said India needed to cut red tape by reducing the number of laws, and called on the foreign ministry to focus on ""economic diplomacy"" to improve India's commercial standing in the world.

At Sam's Club, Wal-Mart's warehouse chain that competes with Costco, sales at stores open at least a year - a key retail metric called same-store sales - fell 0.1 percent in the quarter ended Jan. 31.In contrast, Costco's sales at stores open at least a year rose 3 percent in the second quarter ended Feb. 16.The company's comparable sales rose 2 percent in February, missing the average analyst estimate of an increase of 2.3 percent.Costco said February sales were hurt by club closures prevalent across the United States, Canada and even in Japan due to frequent snow storms.Even so, Nomura analyst Robert Drbul said Costco's consistent low-mid single digit traffic gains over the last year in spite of the challenging retail environment was ""particularly encouraging"". ""We continue to believe the fundamentals of the company are intact,"" Drbul said.The warehouse club operator, which offers discounted merchandise to members, said membership renewals had improved in the quarter.""Our renewal rates continue at record levels and we continue to see increasing penetration of the executive membership,"" CFO Galanti said.Executive members are the company's highest spending customers and represent about 38 percent of total cardholders. They pay an annual fee of $110 and are eligible for a 2 percent annual reward. New membership sign-ups rose 13 percent in the quarter, mainly driven by new stores in Japan and Australia.""High renewal rates, strong new sign-ups and accelerating square footage growth for the next few years, all point to the secular strength of this story,"" Janney Capital analyst David Strasser said.Costco's sales rose 6 percent to $25.76 billion in the quarter, missing the average analyst estimate of $26.65 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Excluding fuel and forex, same-store sales rose 5 percent in the 12 week-period.The company's net profit fell to $463 million, or $1.05 per share, in the quarter from $547 million, or $1.24 per share, a year earlier.Costco has seen steady growth in sales since 2009 due to a continuing increase in its membership base, which saw 4.3 million new members signing up in 2013, according to research firm Trefis.The Issaquah, Washington-based company's shares were down 2.4 percent at $113.65 in late evening trading on the Nasdaq. They fell to a low of $112.27 earlier in the session.Costco's shares trade at roughly 23 times the company's expected earnings, well above the multiples for Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Target Corp, according to Thomson Reuters data.",2014-03-06,WMT,"Thu Mar 6, 2014 | 3:21pm EST",UPDATE 4-Deep discounting eats into Costco's holiday-quarter profit,http://www.reuters.com//article/costco-results-idUSL3N0M33KO20140306?type=companyNews

""Discussions with Carrefour were at an advanced stage. However, the talks were put on hold due to the entry of Japanese retailer Aeon,"" the Indian paper cited one of two sources familiar with the negotiations as saying.""Some of the senior officials of Bharti Retail are in favour of tying up with the French major as it has an existing footprint in India's cash and carry space that would be a perfect match for Bharti Retail,"" the source added.Bharti - which is also the parent of Bharti Airtel  India's biggest mobile phone carrier - and Wal-Mart broke up their six-year-old joint cash and carry venture in October 2013. The move left Bharti to find another deep-pocketed partner to support its retail expansionCarrefour, which has five cash and carry stores in India, would fold this business unit into a joint venture with Bharti, the Economic Times said.Carrefour would also invest in back-end support and commercial real estate companies owned by Bharti, it added.Commenting on his plans for India at Carrefour's 2013 earnings conference earlier this week, Chief Executive Georges Plassat told investors: ""We are currently thinking about India. We have a small business in India, it does not bring any losses or gains but the true challenge is to know how we tackle India for the next 20 years."" Describing India as ""a very complex, very challenging country"", Plassat said Carrefour would not expand there ""on our own anyway"".Global foreign firms have long been frustrated in their efforts to set up shop in India due to complex and restrictive retail legislation.In late 2012, the government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh opened India's $500 billion retail industry to foreign operators, allowing companies such as Wal-Mart and Tesco  to own majority stakes in Indian chains for the first time. However, India left it up to individual states to decide whether or not to allow foreign retailers.So far, fewer than half of India's 28 states have adopted the policy, making it harder for retailers to exploit economies of scale by setting up sourcing and cold storage networks that could serve stores in neighbouring states.Polls show that India's main opposition party Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is on track to win the most seats nationally in elections due by May.The BJP is considered to be more investor-friendly than India's ruling Congress party but opposes foreign direct investment in supermarkets because of its impact on small shopkeepers. It unseated Congress in Rajasthan's state elections in December.",2014-03-07,WMT,"Fri Mar 7, 2014 | 7:02am EST","Japan's Aeon denies Indian retail JV talks, Carrefour silent",http://www.reuters.com//article/carrefour-india-idUSL6N0M410D20140307?type=companyNews
67,"   By Kenneth Knight | TAMPA, Fl., March 8  TAMPA, Fl., March 8 A pregnant woman and her family were hospitalized this week after eating steak bought from a Wal-Mart that local authorities believed was laced with the hallucinogenic drug LSD, according to the medical examiner's initial test results.A blue balloon announcing ""Baby Boy"" fluttered on Saturday outside the home where the family has since returned after Jessica Rosado, who was nine months pregnant when she arrived at the hospital near her home in Tampa, gave birth after having labor induced.Rosado, her partner Ronnie Morales and her two young daughters fell ill on Monday evening after eating some bottom round steak bought from a local Wal-Mart, according to the Tampa Police Department.It was the first meal they had cooked in their new home having moved in two days earlier, police said.Morales was the first to feel sick, and Rosado drove him and her daughters to St Joseph's Hospital after calling 911. He arrived hallucinating and feeling dizzy and short of breath. Rosado then began displaying the same symptoms, and was taken to a hospital across the street where labor was induced and her baby delivered. The two daughters, ages 6 and 7, were sickened a little later that evening.Police took samples of the food the family had been eating from the home. The Hillsborough County medical examiner's office told police on Friday that the steak was contaminated, and that tests showed the presence of lysergic acid diethylamide, or LSD, police said.Police also took the family's oven away for testing. Results from toxicology tests on blood samples taken from the family may take another three weeks, police said. ""There was enough of some type of substance to make all four members of that family gravely ill,"" Jane Castor, Tampa's police chief, told a press conference on Friday. ""The family has no idea where this may have come from.""She said that police had taken all the other bottom round steaks from the Wal-Mart for testing but that this was believed to be an isolated case, and that it was not clear whether a crime had been committed.LSD is a fragile chemical, and can quickly degrade even at room temperature or when exposed to light. If the test results are correct, it remained unclear how a steak might be dosed with LSD in a way that it could retain its potency even when cooked. Police said they were still investigating how or why a steak might end up contaminated in this way.Wal-Mart said it was cooperating with the investigation by police and both federal and state agricultural officials. A spokeswoman pointed out that Wal-Mart receives its meat already prepared and packaged from suppliers, and it was unclear at what point contamination might have taken place.Morales and the daughters were released from the hospital on Wednesday, and Rosado and her newborn son, whom police described as healthy, were released on Thursday.""We're just very grateful that the family appears to be OK,"" Dianna Gee, the Wal-Mart spokeswoman, said.",2014-03-08,WMT,"Sat Mar 8, 2014 | 4:41pm EST",LSD-laced steak sickened Florida family - medical examiner,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-lsd-florida-idUSL2N0M50BA20140308?type=companyNews

69,"  FuelCell Energy Inc (FCEL.O), a United States developer of next-generation fuel cell power plants, said on Monday that revenue jumped and losses narrowed in the first quarter amid growing demand for multi-megawatt fuel cell parks.The company said revenue rose 22 percent to $44.4 million, above the average analyst estimate of $43.4 million according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares in Danbury, Connecticut-based FuelCell rose 8 percent to $4.24 in after-hours trading.Net loss attributable to common FuelCell shareholders narrowed to $11.4 million, or 6 cents per share, from $12.5 million, or 7 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, FuelCell earned 4 cents per share, in line with what analysts had expected. Inquiries and activity levels globally remain high, chief executive Chip Bottone said in a statement, adding that FuelCell was on track to close orders worth multiple megawatts of power capacity.Power facilities running on fuel cells are more expensive to install than plants running on traditional fossil fuels. But they produce electricity electrochemically, offering an efficient, pollution-free alternative to combustion-based power generation. U.S.-listed fuel cell makers, already on a tear in recent months, have surged in value since Plug Power Inc (PLUG.O) announced a contract last week to supply Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N). Investors are convinced that similar deals will follow as companies opt for cleaner technology. FuelCell shares closed at $3.93 on Nasdaq on Monday. They have nearly tripled in value so far this year.(Reporting by Sneha Banerjee and Mridhula Raghavan in Bangalore; Editing by Richard Chang and Kenneth Maxwell)",2014-03-11,WMT,"Mon Mar 10, 2014 | 9:27pm EDT","FuelCell Energy first quarter revenue surges as demand grows, shares rise",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-fuelcell-energy-results-idUSBREA291SB20140311?type=companyNews
70,"   By Garima Goel  Plug Power Inc (PLUG.O) said it expected to post its first ever profit in the fourth quarter this year as orders rise for its hydrogen fuel cells, helped by strong demand from customers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc(WMT.N).Plug Power's shares rose as much as 25 percent to $8.48 in morning trading on the Nasdaq, adding to the sky-rocketing 3,722 percent it has gained in the past year.The company is searching for partners to enter Asia in a similar way to how partnering with Air Liquide (AIRP.PA) helped it enter Europe, CEO Andy Marsh said. The French industrial gas maker also provides Plug Power with hydrogen for its fuel cells.New York-based Plug Power, which also counts German car makers Daimler (DAIGn.DE) Mercedes and BMW (BMWG.DE) as its customers, recently received an order from another automaker, Marsh said, without naming the company.Plug Power's fuel cell systems replace lead-acid batteries to power forklifts without burning fuel, which makes them an efficient, quiet and pollution-free alternative to combustion engines.U.S.-listed fuel cell makers, including Fuel Cell Energy Inc (FCEL.O), have been on a tear in recent months as investors bet on growing demand for the cleaner technology. The rise in Plug Power's stock has also attracted short-seller Citron Research, who on Tuesday argued that the company ""owns no unique technology"".Plug Power currently sources its fuel cell stacks - the core of the technology that converts hydrogen and oxygen into electricity - from Canada's Ballard Power Systems Inc (BLD.TO)(BLDP.O).Marsh said Plug Power could add another supplier later this year and start building its own fuel cell stacks with the aim of shipping the in-house built systems next year. SURGING ORDERS A wider supplier base, as it ramps production and cuts costs, would also help the company's margins improve ""dramatically"", CEO Marsh told Reuters last week.Plug Power said it expected orders to exceed $150 million in 2014, almost four times its total last year. Orders have already exceeded $60 million so far this year, including the order from Wal-Mart in February, the company said.But since the gains from these orders would be realized in the second and third quarters, the company forecast a sequential fall in current-quarter revenue.Plug Power forecast first-quarter revenue of $5-$6 million, lower than the $8 million in the fourth quarter ended December 31. Revenue is expected to be $16-$18 million in the second quarter.The company's net loss widened to $28.9 million, or 8 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, from $8.5 million, or 25 cents per share, a year earlier. The wider loss was due to a $21 million charge related to stock warrants.Plug Power's shares were trading up 12 percent at $7.60 afternoon trading. The stock was the most heavily traded on the Nasdaq.Ballard Power's shares were trading up 9.2 percent at $6.53 in heavy trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange.(Additional reporting by Sneha Banerjee in Bangalore; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Savio D'Souza)",2014-03-13,WMT,"Thu Mar 13, 2014 | 1:05pm EDT",Plug Power eyes first profit on rising fuel cell orders,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-plugpower-results-idUSBREA2C0SS20140313?type=companyNews
71,"  By Phil WahbaMarch 17 A group of 28 U.S. attorneys general has urged Walmart and four other big retailers to stop selling tobacco products, saying they should not be available in stores that provide health care services.The group sent a letter on Sunday to chief executive officers of Wal-Mart Stores Inc, supermarket operators Kroger Co, Safeway Inc, which operate pharmacies, and drugstore chains Walgreen Co and Rite Aid Corp.""Pharmacies and drug stores, which increasingly market themselves as a source for community health care, send a mixed message by continuing to sell deadly tobacco products,"" New York Attorney General Eric Schneider man said in a statement on Monday. Wal-Mart, Walgreen, Rite Aid and Kroger all said they were reviewing the letter, while Safeway did not respond to requests for comment.Schneider and Ohio Attorney General Mike Dewiness led a group of 28 states and territories, including Arizona, Connecticut, Illinois, Puerto Rico and Guam calling for the change. Last month, CVS Caremark Corp, which runs the No. 2 U.S. drugstore chain after Walgreen, said it would stop selling tobacco products at its 7,600 stores by Oct. 1, making it the first national drugstore chain in the United States to take cigarettes off the shelves.The letter from the attorneys general did not mention electronic cigarettes. E-cigarettes, which some politicians and scientists say could be a gateway to smoking, generated sales of nearly $2 billion last year and are growing in popularity. U.S. cigarette sales totaled $91.5 billion last year, according to Euromonitor International.Wal-Mart, Walgreen, Kroger and Rite Aid all sell e-cigarettes. CVS does not.E-cigarettes are battery-powered cartridges that look like cigarettes and contain a nicotine liquid that, when heated, creates an inhalable vapor. This vapor, advocates say, is less dangerous than traditional cigarette smoke since it does not contain lung-damaging tar.Los Angeles City Council this month voted to ban the use of e-cigarettes, from restaurants, bars, nightclubs and other public spaces, joining a growing list of cities, including New York, Boston and Chicago, that restrict the use of e-cigarettes.",2014-03-17,WMT,"Mon Mar 17, 2014 | 1:05pm EDT",UPDATE 1-U.S. attorneys general urge retailers to drop tobacco,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-retail-tobacco-idUSL2N0ME0SF20140317?type=companyNews

73,"   By Phil Wahba | March 17  March 17 A group of 28 U.S. attorneys general is urging chief executive officers of five major retailers, including Walmart, to stop selling tobacco products, saying it is contradictory to carry such items in stores that also provide health care services.The companies receiving a letter on Sunday from the group were Wal-Mart Stores Inc, supermarket operators Kroger Co, Safeway Inc, which operate pharmacies, and drugstore chains Walgreen Co and Rite Aid Corp.

74,"  * Report cites Rwanda's reforms and business-friendliness* Nigeria ranked second, but tough market to crackBy Tiisetso MotsoenengJOHANNESBURG, March 17 Rwanda is Africa's most attractive market for retailers looking to expand in the fast-growing continent, according to a report by consultancy A.T. Kearney that hails the small east African state's economic reforms and business-friendly agenda.Under President Paul Kagame, Rwanda has made great leaps in rebuilding after the 1994 genocide by building roads and making it easy to start or register a new business.""Rwanda has an efficient government and strong macroeconomic indicators that reveal many opportunities for international retailers that can offer basic packaged goods,"" said Marieke Witjes, co-author of A.T. Kearney's first African Retail Development Index, released on Monday.The index, which will be compiled annually, ranks the 20 African countries identified as having the best potential for retailers. Rwanda's 11.5 million people are currently served by two Kenyan supermarket chains, both owned by unlisted retailer Nakumatt Holdings, and a slew of informal traders.A.T. Kearney ranked Nigeria, Africa's most populous country and its second-biggest economy, second in the index, citing its rapid urbanisation, youthful population and rising middle class.But the think-tank said the west African giant was the toughest market in the index to master due to its opaque regulations, congestion at its ports and a lack of land on which to build shopping malls. ""These are all the serious hurdles and roadblocks that will require time and effort to overcome,"" Witjes said.South African retailer Woolworths pulled the plug on its Nigerian business late last year, citing high rents and duties as well as the difficulty of marketing to consumers in the country of 170 million people.Other countries that made it into the top 10 included Namibia, Ghana, Ethiopia and Tanzania. South Africa, Africa's biggest economy and consumer market, came in at seventh, with the report's authors saying the market was already well-penetrated.African growth prospects for retailers were highlighted in 2011 when U.S. giant Wal-Mart bought a majority stake in South Africa's Massmart, giving it a foothold in several frontier African countries.Even though African per capita incomes are among the lowest in the world, a decade of robust economic growth and rapid population expansion have attracted the attention of international retail investors.Coupled with relative political stability, a rising middle class, rapid urbanisation, and slower growth in Europe and South Africa, the logic of setting up shop in Africa is not in doubt - provided companies do their homework, the report said.""It is essential that retailers understand where African countries are in the evolution of the retail landscape and the stages of market development to craft their expansion strategies for Africa,"" report co-author Mirko Warschun said.

The market research firm sees China's internet retail market tripling from 2012 to over $300 billion in 2018 as the country's smartphone-savvy shoppers buy everything from plane tickets to sneakers online.China's biggest social media company, Tencent Holdings Ltd , is leading the revolt, linking the country's most popular messaging app, WeChat, with the number two e-commerce player, JD.com.An array of smaller rivals is also clawing away at Alibaba's lead, while household retail names like Nike Inc and Gap Inc are increasingly striking out away from the giant's Tmall electronic platform to set up more distinctive online stores of their own.""In China shopping is a social activity.

He declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the topic.The BJP's candidate for prime minister, Narendra Modi, is campaigning on his economic record in running his home state, Gujarat, where the party trumpets an unemployment rate of less than a third of the national average.By contrast the incumbent Congress party, which unveiled its manifesto on Wednesday, is appealing to its core constituency of poorer voters who it says should be given the chance to participate in ""inclusive"" growth.""Growth by itself is not sufficient,"" Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told an event at which Congress president Sonia Gandhi made a rare public appearance to support her son Rahul's leadership of the party's flagging campaign.While the BJP platform seeks to tap into the hopes of 100 million first-time voters whose job prospects have been hurt by a slowdown in economic growth, the tenets of 'Modinomics' remain nebulous beyond a broad focus on supply-side reforms. ""Most of these proposals have been discussed by other parties too,"" said Shumita Sharma Deveshwar, a director at Trusted Sources, a policy advisory firm. ""The key is implementation of these policies. That is the bigger challenge.""CAUTIOUS OPENING The BJP's policy platform takes a cautious stance towards opening up the Indian economy, Asia's third largest, to foreign direct investment.There will be no quick move to allow the likes of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. or Tesco easier entry into so-called 'multi-brand' retail, which would pose an existential threat to small traders who form a key BJP constituency. ""The domestic retail industry needs to be first made competitive before allowing foreign investment,"" a second BJP source said.However, the BJP would propose raising a cap on foreign ownership of Indian defense industry enterprises to 49 percent from 26 percent now.Although India spends only a third as much as China on defense, it is the world's largest market for arms exports - reflecting a failure of past governments to turn around the state-dominated domestic defense industry.The legacy of dependence on the Soviet security umbrella has been prolonged by corruption scandals that have held up deals with foreign partners that would have moved production to India. ""We can save huge foreign exchange by producing defense equipment at home,"" the source said.""(We would) raise the FDI cap, (and) allow Indian companies to enter into joint ventures with foreign companies. It could be an arrangement where Indian partners hold the majority stake, say 51 percent.""Elsewhere, the BJP is expected to propose a national general sales tax - key to getting rid of a hodge-podge of existing levies. More broadly, it will seek to improve tax collection by lowering rates and closing loopholes.A ""broad consensus"" exists to overhaul the financial sector to turn India into an international hub, the source said.Analysts caution that the BJP and its allies, which polls show falling around 40 seats short of a majority, may end up having to strike a series of compromises to cobble together a parliamentary majority.""A lot of this is theoretical and open to question right now,"" said Deveshwar.

By contrast the incumbent Congress party, which unveiled its manifesto on Wednesday, is appealing to its core constituency of poorer voters who it says should be given the chance to participate in ""inclusive"" growth.""Growth by itself is not sufficient,"" Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told an event at which Congress president Sonia Gandhi made a rare public appearance to support her son Rahul's leadership of the party's flagging campaign.While the BJP platform seeks to tap into the hopes of 100 million first-time voters whose job prospects have been hurt by a slowdown in economic growth, the tenets of 'Modinomics' remain nebulous beyond a broad focus on supply-side reforms.""Most of these proposals have been discussed by other parties too,"" said Shumita Sharma Deveshwar, a director at Trusted Sources, a policy advisory firm. ""The key is implementation of these policies. That is the bigger challenge."" CAUTIOUS OPENING The BJP's policy platform takes a cautious stance towards opening up the Indian economy, Asia's third largest, to foreign direct investment.There will be no quick move to allow the likes of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. or Tesco easier entry into so-called 'multi-brand' retail, which would pose an existential threat to small traders who form a key BJP constituency.""The domestic retail industry needs to be first made competitive before allowing foreign investment,"" a second BJP source said. However, the BJP would propose raising a cap on foreign ownership of Indian defence industry enterprises to 49 percent from 26 percent now.Although India spends only a third as much as China on defence, it is the world's largest market for arms exports - reflecting a failure of past governments to turn around the state-dominated domestic defence industry.The legacy of dependence on the Soviet security umbrella has been prolonged by corruption scandals that have held up deals with foreign partners that would have moved production to India.""We can save huge foreign exchange by producing defence equipment at home,"" the source said.""(We would) raise the FDI cap, (and) allow Indian companies to enter into joint ventures with foreign companies. It could be an arrangement where Indian partners hold the majority stake, say 51 percent.""Elsewhere, the BJP is expected to propose a national general sales tax - key to getting rid of a hodge-podge of existing levies. More broadly, it will seek to improve tax collection by lowering rates and closing loopholes.A ""broad consensus"" exists to overhaul the financial sector to turn India into an international hub, the source said.Analysts caution that the BJP and its allies, which polls show falling around 40 seats short of a majority, may end up having to strike a series of compromises to cobble together a parliamentary majority.""A lot of this is theoretical and open to question right now,"" said Deveshwar. ""Let's see what kind of coalition is formed after the election.""

83,"  (Corrects to remove erroneous RIC)By Shyamantha Asokan and Rajesh Kumar SinghNEW DELHI, March 26 India's leading opposition party would aim to create 250 million jobs over the next 10 years as part of an economic development programme that could create 100 new 'smart' cities, its election manifesto will say.The Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has put jobs and urbanisation at the centre of its policy pitch as it seeks to oust the Congress-led government in a general election starting on April 7, two party sources told Reuters. ""The manifesto's priorities, in this order, are jobs, investment, manufacturing and infrastructure,"" said one party official involved in drafting the document, which is expected to be released next week.The BJP, on course to win the largest number of seats in the five-week election, wants to tap into the aspirations of young people in a country where more than half of the population is under the age of 25. By contrast, the Congress party, which was due to unveil its own election manifesto on Wednesday, is running campaign ads that depict smiling artisans making bricks or weaving by hand - an appeal to its core constituency of poor voters.The BJP's candidate for prime minister, Narendra Modi, is also campaigning on his record of economic development running his home state, Gujarat, which on many metrics has performed better than the national average over the past decade. In other points, the BJP will propose introducing a national general sales tax - seen as key to getting rid of a hodge-podge of existing levies to make tax collection more effective - and streamlining subsidies, a second source said.But the party is cautious about opening up so-called 'multi-brand' retail to foreign direct investors such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Tesco, as this could pose an existential threat to millions of small traders that constitute a big voter constituency.""The domestic retail industry needs to be first made competitive before allowing foreign investment,"" the second source said.

84,"   By Phil Wahba  Wal-Mart Stores Inc this week sued Visa Inc for $5 billion, accusing the credit and debit card network of excessively high card swipe fees, several months after the retailer opted out of a class action settlement between merchants and Visa and MasterCard Inc.Visa declined to comment on the suit, filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas, where Wal-Mart is headquartered.Visa and other card networks charge retailers fees, called swipe fees or interchange fees, each time a shopper uses a debit or credit card to pay.In December, a federal judge in Brooklyn, N.Y., approved a $5.7 billion class action settlement between merchants and Visa and MasterCard despite the objections of thousands of retailers that complained it was inadequate.Wal-Mart, Amazon.com Inc, and Target Corp were among those opting out of the monetary components of the settlement to have the freedom to seek damages on their own. Those businesses complained about a broad litigation release in the settlement. The release forces all merchants who accepted Visa or MasterCard, and those who will in the future, to give up their right to sue the credit card companies over rules at issue in the case or similar ones they may make in the future.Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, is seeking damages from price fixing and other antitrust violations that it claims took place between January 1, 2004 and November 27, 2012. In its lawsuit, Wal-Mart contends that Visa, in concert with banks, sought to prevent retailers from protecting themselves against those swipe fees, eventually hurting sales.""The anticompetitive conduct of Visa and the banks forced Wal-Mart to raise retail prices paid by its customers and/or reduce retail services provided to its customers as a means of offsetting some of the artificially inflated interchange fees,"" Wal-Mart in court documents.""As a result, Wal-Mart's retail sales were below what they would have been otherwise.""

86,"   By John Ruwitch | DENGFENG, China  DENGFENG, China Huang Xingguo took a job as a cashier at a new Walmart store in his hometown in southern China for a steady paycheck and the prospect of upward mobility after a string of sales jobs and a run as a day trader.Five years later, he has landed on the frontlines of China's labor rights movement, an unlikely leader of several dozen workers seeking better severance pay after the store in the Hunan province city of Changde announced last month it was closing.It's not the biggest labor dispute China has seen in a recent surge of activism that has included factory strikes involving thousands of workers, but experts say it's among the more significant.In China, as in other countries, Wal-Mart Stores Inc has figured prominently in the debate over worker rights. Unions first opened at its stores in 2006 during a major government-led drive to unionize private companies. The Chinese government used Wal-Mart as a fillip for greater unionization at foreign firms.The Changde case would not just set a precedent for Wal-Mart, but for other foreign companies seeking to restructure their operations in response to a slowing Chinese economy.Worker protests are common in China, but leaders like Huang are not. Huang is chairman of the state-backed union at Walmart store No. 2024, and was democratically elected to the post, which makes him even rarer. Because Huang is a union branch leader, the case is also a challenge to the world's largest and China's only legal union, the 260 million-member All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU).Over the past several years, China's union has sat on the sidelines as workers, emboldened by a demographic shift that has led to a shrinking labor pool, have become more knowledgeable about their rights and proactive in using both collective action and the legal system to protect them. The ACFTU has typically done little to protect the rights of laborers in disputes, despite a mandate to do so, experts and workers say. Most union branch bosses in China are hand-picked by management.Labor rights lawyers, scholars and activists hope Huang's example can push the ACFTU toward greater activism for workers.Last week, about two dozen lawyers, scholars and labor activists brought Huang and three of his colleagues to discuss the case for two days at a hotel in Dengfeng, Henan province - a location one of the organizers said was chosen because it is far from the spotlight of Hunan.""This case is significant because he (Huang) is an inside-the-system, legal union chairman,"" said Wang Jiangsong, a Beijing-based labor scholar who was at the meetings. ""It's a very valuable case.""GIVE THEM RESPECT Short, with a buzz cut and a round face punctuated by a goatee beard and rectangular glasses, Huang, 42, is unassuming and says he was motivated to fight Wal-Mart because it was the right thing to do.After receiving a degree in Chinese from a university in Hunan, Huang worked for a state-owned general merchandise company for six years, advancing to middle management. He and others were bought out in the late 1990s amid China's state-owned enterprise restructuring campaign and he went into pharmaceutical sales, bouncing between companies.It was as a sales team leader that Huang says he learned the secret to good worker-management relations. ""In the process of organizing these people I learned that only if you think about them and think about their interests will the group have cohesion,"" he told Reuters on the sidelines of the meeting in Dengfeng. In February 2009, Huang started work at the new Walmart store in Changde. Beginning at the cash register, Huang moved up and eventually became an administrative manager. By 2011, he had joined the union committee as a vice chairman and was sent on a training course on the union's role that was run by the provincial ACFTU.""This was the first time I really understood what the union organization was about,"" he said. ""After that training I felt that the union had a bigger mission and responsibilities.""In early 2013, he was unanimously elected chairman of the store branch of the union.MAJOR CHANGE But the Changde Walmart was flailing, according to Huang. Sales went from weak to worse and foot traffic was thin, he said, adding that the number of staff had more than halved to under 150 by early this year.Raymond Bracy, head of corporate affairs at Walmart China, said the company schedules and manages labor at stores worldwide to match store traffic. ""Sometimes, these actions allow us to keep the store open. In Changde, it was not enough to keep the store open,"" he said.In late February, Huang said Wal-Mart offered him a promotion to a job in the Hunan capital of Changsha on condition he would agree to help make an upcoming, but unspecified, ""major change"" at the Changde store proceed smoothly, he said. He feared the store might be slated to close. If Huang was offered a promotion and a move to another store, Bracy said, ""he was no doubt viewed as a capable associate who had the potential to contribute in another role"".On March 5, Wal-Mart announced the store would indeed close two weeks later.""I knew I needed to help the workers,"" Huang said. ""I knew that if I didn't, I would not be able to forgive myself.""He turned down the job in Changsha and started mobilizing the union. The workers were unhappy that there was no prior consultation before the store closure was announced. They also took issue with the level of compensation Wal-Mart was offering those who decided to take a buy-out, arguing they were being dismissed illegally and deserved more.Undergirding their displeasure, Huang said, was the feeling that Wal-Mart had not given workers their due respect. Ironic, he noted, as one of Wal-Mart's self-proclaimed core values is ""respect for the individual"".Several rounds of consultation between the union and the company have failed to end the disagreement. Workers temporarily blocked Wal-Mart from clearing the store of goods, and asked the government for backing. The union is considering taking the case to formal arbitration.""The reason Wal-Mart is holding on, even to the point where their expenditures have surpassed what the workers in this case are asking for, is because they do not want the way the Changde Walmart situation is resolved to become a precedent,"" said a scholar involved in the case who declined to be identified because of her close ties to the ACFTU. Wal-Mart said in October it planned to close 15-30 China stores through 2016 while opening up to 110 and creating nearly 19,000 jobs as part of efforts to revitalize its business. It has around 400 stores in China. In the Changde case, the company had ""met obligations the law requires"", paying workers whose contracts expired based on the number of years of service, Bracy said.The AFL-CIO, the United States' biggest federation of unions, said it ""supports the demands of Chinese workers"" in a statement about the case on its website on March 28.THE SAFE CHOICE Over two days at the hotel in Henan, lawyers, scholars and NGO experts debated the legal merits of the case and offered advice for navigating what are essentially uncharted waters for a local union branch.China's unions are fundamentally weak, said the scholar with ACFTU ties. Its mandate is to protect the interests of the nation - or government - above those of the workers. ""When there's a conflict they have to protect the former,"" the scholar said. ""It's the safe choice.""In a country where the right to strike is not legally protected, labor organizing is a risky business. The government puts a premium on maintaining a stable, investment-friendly environment.A Shenzhen court on Friday convened a second hearing in the case of Wu Guijun, a former furniture factory employee who took part in a May 2013 protest over the plant management's refusal to discuss compensation for workers affected by the factory's impending closure and relocation.Wu, who had been elected as a worker representative but had nothing to do with the official union, was charged with gathering a crowd to disrupt public order, and detained. The case is being watched as a barometer for the government's waning tolerance for strikes.Friends have called Huang to warn him to back down for his own sake. But union leaders from other Walmart stores in China have also called to learn from the situation in Changde.Huang is under no illusions.""In terms of the protection of collective rights in this case I'm not optimistic. Nor am I optimistic about the future work prospects for those of us who are leading this effort to protect our rights,"" he said.""But we have no regrets.

90,"   By Nandita Bose | MUMBAI  MUMBAI The political party expected to lead India's next government confirmed on Monday it would ban foreign supermarkets from the $500 billion retail sector, a move that would deal a fresh setback to global chains such as Wal-Mart and Carrefour.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has in recent years opposed investment by foreign firms into multi-brand retail, made the announcement in its election manifesto, which it unveiled in New Delhi earlier.If elected, the BJP said it would welcome foreign direct investment in all sectors that create local jobs, except for supermarkets.It is not clear, however, whether the BJP, which is forecast to win the most parliamentary seats in a five-week election that started on Monday, would follow through on the ban. The BJP is likely to need coalition partners to form a government.""Pre-election rhetoric and decision making post-election are two different things,"" said a person who worked on the manifesto but who declined to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media. India's federal government gave foreign supermarket chains the green light in September 2012, but then left if up to individual states to enact the legislation.

91,"   By Nandita Bose | MUMBAI, April 7  MUMBAI, April 7 The political party expected to lead India's next government confirmed on Monday it would ban foreign supermarkets from the $500 billion retail sector, a move that would deal a fresh setback to global chains such as Wal-Mart and Carrefour.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has in recent years opposed investment by foreign firms into multi-brand retail, made the announcement in its election manifesto, which it unveiled in New Delhi earlier.If elected, the BJP said it would welcome foreign direct investment in all sectors that create local jobs, except for supermarkets.It is not clear, however, whether the BJP, which is forecast to win the most parliamentary seats in a five-week election that started on Monday, would follow through on the ban. The BJP is likely to need coalition partners to form a government.""Pre-election rhetoric and decision making post-election are two different things,"" said a person who worked on the manifesto but who declined to be named because he is not authorised to speak to the media. India's federal government gave foreign supermarket chains the green light in September 2012, but then left if up to individual states to enact the legislation.

94,"   By Tiisetso Motsoeneng and Nomatter Ndebele | JOHANNESBURG  JOHANNESBURG Massmart (MSMJ.J), South Africa's No.4 retailer by market value, plans to enter oil-rich Angola with two stores by 2015, a senior executive said, as the unit of Wal-Mart (WMT.N) expands on a continent that is still largely an informal retail market.Speaking at the Reuters Africa Investment Summit in Johannesburg, Mark Turner, Massmart's Africa director, said one store would open in the first quarter of next year and the other in the third quarter.""We've got two deals that are coming off the ground in Angola, which is a country on the southern part of Africa that we're not represented (in),"" Turner told the summit.Another two stores would be opened in Angola in 2017.Massmart, which operates in 11 sub-Saharan countries such Nigeria, Tanzania and Ghana, has been pushing further into the rest of the continent that is forecast to be home to 2 billion people by 2050, to offset slowing growth at home.Turner also said the company - 51 percent owned by Wal-Mart Stores Inc - was building its first store in Kenya after failing to clinch unspecified acquisitions that would have given it a substantial footprint in east Africa's biggest economy. The low margin, high volume retailer that sells everything from electronics products to food is also scanning French-speaking countries such as Senegal and Cameroon for opportunities.Although lucrative, Ethiopia was out of the question because laws there do not allow for foreign retailers, Turner said.Even though African per capita incomes are among the lowest in the world, a decade of robust economic growth and rapid population expansion have attracted the attention of retail and services executives around the world. Coupled with relative political stability, a rising middle class, rapid urbanization, and slower growth in Europe and South Africa, the logic of setting up shop elsewhere in Africa is not in doubt - provided companies do their homework.""Going into Africa is not cookie cutter, if it was more cookie cutter we could roll out a lot quicker, but it's not,"" Turner said. ""It's really getting into those markets and understanding them.""Massmart's rival Woolworths (WHLJ.J) pulled the plug on its Nigerian business late last year, citing poor supply chain infrastructure, high rents and duties and the difficulty of marketing to consumers. Turner said it could take at least two months for imported goods to reach shelves in many east African countries, highlighting ports congestion, compared with up to eight days in southern African countries.Massmart imports about 20 percent of its products to Nigeria, which on Sunday surpassed South Africa as the continent's biggest economy after a rebasing calculation.Follow Reuters Summits on Twitter @Reuters_Summits(This story corrects last paragraph to show Massmart imports 20 percent of its products to Nigeria)(Editing by Mark Potter)",2014-04-08,WMT,"Tue Apr 8, 2014 | 9:35am EDT",South Africa's Massmart to enter Angola with two stores,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-africa-summit-idUSBREA3712520140408?type=companyNews

97,"  LONDON, April 8 Britain's big four grocers - Tesco, Wal-Mart's Asda, Sainsbury's  and Morrisons - all lost market share over the last three months to discounters Aldi and Lidl, industry data showed on Tuesday.     The data from market researcher Kantar Worldpanel showed the UK grocery market continuing to polarise, with the big four being squeezed between the discounters and upmarket players such as Waitrose.     Although Britain's economy is recovering from a long and deep recession, household budgets have remained under pressure due to subdued wages growth, with many shoppers looking to save money while also splashing out on the occasional treat.     Kantar said Aldi's sales leapt 35.3 percent year-on-year in the 12 weeks to March 30 - its highest ever growth rate, boosting the discounter to a record market share of 4.6 percent.     Lidl's sales rose 17.2 percent, taking its share to 3.4 percent.     Sales declines at the big four were accentuated by the later timing of Easter this year, included in the 2013 period but not in this data.     Asda proved the most resilient with a sales fall of 0.5 percent, while Morrisons, which issued a profit warning last month, was the worst performer with a decline of 3.8 percent.       Tesco's sales fell 3.0 percent, while sales at Sainsbury's declined 1.7 percent.     Waitrose's sales rose 4.5 percent, allowing it to hold on to its record 5.0 percent market share.     Overall grocery market growth slowed to 0.6 percent.     Kantar estimates that Easter accounts for market growth of 0.9 percent.     It said grocery inflation was 1.8 percent for the 12 week period - the lowest level since July 2010.

The Wild Oats offers will include staples such as salsa, organic olive oil, canned black beans and tomato paste. ""If we can make that price premium disappear, we think it will grow much, much faster,"" Jack Sinclair, executive vice president of grocery at Walmart U.S., said of the retailer's small but faster-growing organic sales.Walmart's own research showed that 91 percent of its shoppers would purchase affordable organic products if they were offered, Sinclair added.Kraft Foods Group Inc KRFT.O, Kellogg Co (K.N), Unilever Plc (ULVR.L) and many other large companies have taken small steps to respond as health-conscious consumers lose their taste for the highly processed foods that the industry made famous.As a result, they have lost some market share to smaller players such as WhiteWave Foods Co (WWAV.N), the parent of organic dairy seller Horizon, and Annie's Inc BNNY.N. ""Consumer demand has been ahead of traditional packaged food. Walmart is acknowledging that,"" said Consumer Edge Research analyst Robert Dickerson, who called the move from Walmart inevitable and said it could place incremental pricing pressure on the packaged food industry over time.Walmart will roll out 100 Wild Oats packaged foods products to half of its 4,000 stores in the coming months.The retailer, which is not expanding shelf space to accommodate the new items, already sells more than 1,600 organic products, including produce and dairy items. Walmart is not removing the organic price premium on those products.It plans to keep a lid on prices by eliminating middle men and striking long-term agreements with farmers, Sinclair said.

101,"   By Tiisetso Motsoeneng and David Dolan | JOHANNESBURG  JOHANNESBURG The chief executive of South Africa's Massmart Holdings Ltd (MSMJ.J) will quit later this year, leaving the unit of Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) in the midst of a problematic expansion across Africa and growing competition at home.Chief Executive Grant Pattison, who oversaw seven years of steady growth and engineered the sale of a majority stake to Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, will be replaced by his deputy, Chief Operating Officer (COO) Guy Hayward, from June 1, the company said on Friday.""It's a bit of a surprise that he is stepping down because he's young, but it's also understandable that he'd be looking for a new challenge after seven years at the helm and 'burn out' could be around the corner,"" said Jean Pierre Verster, a fund manager at Johannesburg-based 360ne Asset Management.""I do think that the handover to Guy is seamless. He's been with the company for a number of years ... so there are safe hands in terms of succession planning.""Hayward, a chartered accountant, inherits the company as it faces tough competition at home and as it rolls out its grocery business to take on industry leaders Shoprite Holdings (SHPJ.J) and Pick n Pay Stores (PIKJ.J). He is expected to continue with the company's African expansion strategy, which has been slow due to a shortage of the sort of prime retail space which it favors in lucrative markets such as Nigeria.Massmart founder and Chairman Mark Lamberti will also step down as of April 10, a move which analysts anticipated after Lamberti was recently appointed chief executive of logistics firm Imperial Holdings (IPLJ.J). He will be replaced by mining and investment executive Kuseni Dlamini.GOOD SHAPE  Pattison gave no reason for his departure but said: ""The group is in good shape and well positioned for growth and I can think of no better time to hand over the reins.""

""He is a financial chap. He spent years as CFO (chief financial officer) before he became COO a couple of years ago. He's not a retailer. You need people like (Shoprite CEO Whitey) Basson or Pick n Pay's (CEO Richard) Brasher,"" the analyst said.

104,"   By Lucia Mutikani | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. retail sales recorded their largest gain in 1-1/2 years in March in a decisive sign the economy is bouncing back from its weather-induced slumber.Monday's upbeat report was the latest to indicate growth was set to accelerate in the second quarter after an unusually cold and snowy winter hobbled activity early in the year.""It shows there is an underlying current of strength in the economy despite the drag from the severe winter weather,"" said Robert Dye, chief economist at Comerica in Dallas.The Commerce Department said retail sales increased 1.1 percent last month, the biggest gain since September 2012, with receipts rising in nearly all categories.February's increase was raised to 0.7 percent from a previously reported 0.3 percent. Economists had expected retail sales, which account for a third of consumer spending, to advance only 0.8 percent last month.The data combined with an improvement in quarterly profits from Citigroup to lift stocks on Wall Street after a sharp selloff in recent sessions. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasury debt fell.The sales figures added to recent employment data in suggesting the economy found momentum at the end of the first quarter. Job growth averaged 195,000 per month in February and March, an improvement over the prior two months, and first-time applications for unemployment benefits in early April fell back to their pre-recession level.These bullish signals have bolstered hopes that growth this year will be the fastest since the 2007-09 recession ended. ""This is not a fragile economy. The linchpin of economic growth, the consumer is back and with the consumer's help, growth will be even faster in 2014,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in New York.A separate report from the New York Fed released on Monday showed people grew more confident in the labor market last month, with younger workers in particular seeing a greater chance of finding work should they lose their current job.ON SOLID FOOTING The retail sales data led some economists to bump up first-quarter GDP growth estimates briefly, before they scrambled to lower them after a separate Commerce Department report showed retail inventories, excluding automobiles, rose only 0.2 percent in February after increasing 0.6 percent in January. Businesses accumulated too much stock in the second half of last year and are placing fewer orders with manufacturers as they work through the pile of unsold goods.That has left the inventory to sales ratio at its highest level since September 2009. But with consumers showing an appetite to spend, thanks to improving household wealth, businesses should be able to reduce their bloated stocks.First-quarter gross domestic product growth estimates now range as low as a 0.5 percent annual pace. Many economists, however, expect growth of around a 3 percent rate in the second quarter and through the rest of the year.So-called core retail sales, which strip out automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, and which correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of the government's GDP report, increased 0.8 percent in March. February's core sales were revised to show a 0.4 percent rise instead of the previously reported 0.3 percent gain.Nevertheless, consumer spending likely slowed sharply in the first quarter from the fourth quarter's brisk 3.3 percent pace as core sales fell in January.Retail sales last month were buoyed by a 3.1 percent surge in receipts at automobile and parts dealers, the biggest advance since September 2012. Still, even excluding autos, sales rose 0.7 percent, the biggest increase in a year.Sales at building materials and garden equipment stores recorded their largest gain in eight months. The share price of home improvement chain Lowe's was up about 1 percent on Monday, outperforming the broader market.Receipts at electronics and appliance stores, however, fell as did sales at gasoline stations. Retail sales excluding gasoline increased a solid 1.4 percent, the biggest advance in four years.There were gains in sales at furniture, clothing, general merchandise, health and personal care, food and beverage, sporting goods, restaurants and nonstore retailers.(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci)",2014-04-14,WMT,"Mon Apr 14, 2014 | 6:53pm EDT",Bullish U.S. retail sales brighten growth outlook,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-retail-sales-idUSBREA3D0SP20140414?type=companyNews

109,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 16 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'AA' rating to Wal-Mart  Stores, Inc.'s (Walmart) $2.5 billion note issuance, consisting of: --$500 million of 1% notes due 2017; --$1 billion of 3.3% notes due 2024; and  --1 billion of 4.3% notes due 2044.  The Rating Outlook is Stable. The proceeds from the issuance will be used for  general corporate purposes. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this  release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating reflects Walmart's dominant market position in North America, strong  position in the UK, and meaningful presence in other markets such as: China,  Brazil, Central America and South Africa. Also considered is Walmart's low  cyclicality, consistent free cash flow (FCF), and steady financial leverage  despite ongoing debt-financed share repurchases.  These factors are balanced by a more challenging economic environment pressuring  the company's core customer base, and growing competition from dollar stores and  hard discounters, among others. Walmart's success flows from its broad selection and sharp prices, made possible  by its low operating costs and significant buying power. Despite these  strengths, comparable store (comp) sales in Walmart's U.S. segment (which  excludes Sam's Clubs and accounted for 75% of consolidated operating earnings in  2013) declined by 0.6% in 2013 (ending Jan. 31, 2014), following increases of  1.8% in 2012 and 0.3% in 2011.  This decline reflects the difficult environment facing low-income consumers,  including the payroll tax increase that was implemented as of Jan. 1, 2013, and  low food inflation. For 2014, Fitch expects comp sales will remain sluggish,  reflecting ongoing economic pressures facing low-income consumers.  Despite soft top-line results, Walmart has been able to maintain a steady  operating margin at or near 6% (5.6% in 2013). Going forward, Fitch expects  operating margins will remain consistent with historical levels. Steady operating results have enabled Walmart to generate stable credit metrics  over time, with adjusted debt/EBITDAR of 1.7x -2.0x and EBITDAR/interest plus  rents of 7.8x - 8.3x over the past five years. FCF after dividends was $4 billion in 2013, down from $7.3 billion in 2012, due  to lower earnings and higher capital expenditures. Share repurchases are  expected to continue to exceed FCF, and to be partly debt-financed, as Fitch  expects the company will manage its adjusted debt/EBITDAR ratio at or under  2.0x, in the context of maintaining its 'AA' rating.  RATING SENSITIVITIES An upgrade is unlikely, given that the rating is currently at the high end of  the rating spectrum and fully captures the company's financial and qualitative  strengths. Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to negative  rating action include: --A debt-financed acquisition or accelerated share repurchases that pushed  adjusted leverage to over 2x for an extended period; --Persistently weak comp store sales and/or more pronounced gross margin  pressure that cannot be offset by expense leverage. Fitch currently rates Walmart as follows: Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'AA';  --Senior unsecured debt 'AA'; --Bank credit facility 'AA'; --Short-term IDR 'F1+'; --Commercial paper 'F1+'.

110,"   By Phil Wahba  Wal-Mart Stores Inc is launching a money transfer service in a direct challenge to the dominance of Western Union Co. and MoneyGram, aiming to broaden the financial services it offers to low-income customers and increase store traffic.Wal-Mart said on Thursday that Euronet Worldwide Inc's Ria Money Transfer subsidiary would begin running the service, called ""Walmart-2-Walmart,"" next week.The new service, which Wal-Mart says will charge lower fees than those currently offered by competitors, will enable shoppers to send and receive cash from family members and friends at more than 4,000 U.S. discount stores.Wal-Mart, which will not offer the service online or in its international stores, hopes consumers will turn around and spend at least some of that money at the stores.Daniel Eckert, senior vice president of services for Walmart U.S., said Walmart-2-Walmart ""challenges the status quo and drives down prices.""After the news, Western Union shares were down 4 percent, while those of MoneyGram International Inc, which currently provides such services for Wal-Mart shoppers, plummeted 15.6 percent. Euronet was up 4.4 percent.""This significant foray casts a pall over Western Union's pricing model and long-term organic revenue growth outlook,"" Andrew Jeffrey, an analyst at SunTrust Robinson, said in a research note.For Western Union, U.S. domestic money transfer represents about 8 percent of its total 2013 revenue. When asked about the new Walmart service, Western Union said it was well-positioned in the business, saying it offered services through a network of about 46,000 agents in the United States alone.Sterne Agee analyst Jennifer Dugan said she thought the new Walmart service would not have a significant impact on Western Union's market share and average pricing.""We believe Western Union's agent locations in the U.S. are ... more convenient to the majority of those sending and receiving money transfers,"" she wrote in a research note.LITTLE ACCESS TO BANKING SERVICES  The new service is another effort to boost finance revenues from Wal-Mart customers, many of whom have little access to banking services, into stores that are experiencing declining traffic.According to a 2011 survey by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, 8.2 percent of U.S. households are ""unbanked"" and another 20.1 percent are ""underbanked,"" making money transfers an important personal finance tool for them.Walmart-2-Walmart customers can transfer up to $50 for a fee of $4.50, compared with between $4.75 and $5 at rival services, Wal-Mart said. Transferring $900 will cost $$9.50, compared with $73 via MoneyGram.""The bigger loser is MoneyGram as they have a bigger threat as they have 27 percent revenue that came from Walmart in 2013,"" said Rahul Agarwal at Guggenheim Partners. ""MoneyGram gets a quarter of their revenue through that agreement."" The Walmart service will limit customers to $900 in transfers a day; higher amounts would require the sender to provide much more information, adding a level of complexity that would compound costs, Eckert told Reuters, noting there will little demand anyway for transfers above $1,000.Consumers can still transfer money through MoneyGram. MoneyGram also facilitates online money transfers, while WalMart-2-Mart will strictly transfer cash from store to store.Western Union said its online domestic money transfer service was growing fast.Wal-Mart has long been interested in taking a bigger piece of the financial services market. It had applied for a bank charter but withdrew it in 2007 after opposition from banks and labor unions.Wal-Mart U.S. last year generated about 1 percent of annual sales from financial services such as money orders, prepaid cards, wire transfers, check cashing and bill payments, according to its latest annual report. The company offers those services at its Walmart MoneyCenter locations and customer service desks.Wal-Mart shares were up 0.6 percent to $77.70 in afternoon trading.(Reporting by Phil Wahba in New York.

But there is a huge silver lining for long-term investors in environmentally-friendly companies and technologies.To stave off a nearly 5-degree global temperature increase by 2100, nations must cut their global greenhouse emissions by up to 70 percent by the middle of this century, according to a recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.There's little consensus among developed and emerging nations on how to effectively deal with climate change and reduce the amount of greenhouse gases, but there is agreement on one aspect of this global threat: Trillions of needed dollars will continue to pour into renewable and clean sources of energy, transportation, building and manufacturing.Although investors have typically focused on a small group of ""clean tech"" funds and stocks, you can cast a wider net to capture the upside of this influx of investment. Nearly every company in the S&P 500 Index has some involvement in ""greening"" their operations from recycling to creating their own sources of clean energy.Take wind power. The retailer Ikea recently announced it was buying a wind farm in Illinois. Microsoft Corp is purchasing a Texas wind facility. Facebook Inc, Google Inc and Wal-Mart Stores Inc are also investing in the technology. On the solar power front, solar panel prices have plummeted and there are a host of collateral technologies such as battery storage, energy management systems and co-generation that deserve attention.One of the oldest and most diversified mutual funds in this sector is the New Alternatives Fund Inc, which is up 35 percent for the last 12 months through April 17 and up 8 percent year to date, compared to just under one percent for the MSCI EAFE index. The fund is expensive to own, though, charging a 1.1 percent annual management fee and 4.75-percent initial sales charge.The New Alternatives portfolio samples several companies from the clean tech sector, holding industry leaders like Vestas Wind Systems A/S, Johnson Controls Inc and American Water Works Co. A less-costly fund to own is the PowerShares Cleantech ETF , which holds ABB Ltd, Corning Inc and Siemens AG, companies with several stakes in broad-based energy businesses. The fund charges 0.67 percent annually for management expenses. It's up 33 percent for the 12 months through April 17.LANDSCAPE FOR GREEN POWER  What will make alternative energy profitable is what experts called clean ""distributed"" power, that is, electricity that's not generated by old-line utilities on the grid using coal or nuclear energy. When clean energy becomes competitive with fossil fuels, that's when it makes economic sense, which has been increasingly the case.Falling costs of alternative energy products in recent year are enhancing the potential of clean energy technologies and displacing ""dirty"" power plants.According to a recent report by the consulting firm McKinsey & Company on solar energy, the drop in price residential consumers pay in the United States to install rooftop solar systems means ""These cost reductions will put solar within striking distance, in economic terms, of new construction for traditional power-generation technologies, such as coal, natural gas, and nuclear energy.""The outlook for solar energy also applies in a general sense to wind and other clean-energy technologies. As costs of running a coal-fired or nuclear plant continue to rise, alternative energy prices keep falling, making them competitive on a mass scale.As one of the smallest sub-sectors in the overall economy, though, clean energy has been volatile. And price wars in solar cells have turned leading solar companies valuations into roller coasters. First Solar Inc's stock price, for example, was in negative territory from 2009 through 2012, then skyrocketed 77 percent last year. The company is up 27 percent year-to-date through April 17.Take heed: Even investing through a diversified index fund like the PowerShares ETF is going to be rocky. The fund has a five-year volatility measure of nearly 22, compared to about 16 for an MSCI World stock index.  It also lost half of its value in 2008. If you're going to invest in this sector, stay away from concentrating your holdings in single stocks. While the climate for these stocks looks good at the moment - and will certainly pay dividends over time - the short-term outlook could change rapidly.

The current China chief executive, Greg Foran, will become Asia CEO.China is key to Wal-Mart's international ambitions but it has stumbled in a market where consumers value safe and authentic food over the low prices the retailer is famed for. Wal-Mart has been in China for 17 years. This year, Wal-Mart was embroiled in a scandal over tainted donkey meat. Workers also went on strike at some of its stores. It is now changing its China approach, closing some big stores that never caught on with locals and focusing more on its own-brand products and imports, quality and safety. Clarke has been with the grocery chain for 15 years, including the last two in his current role in China overseeing areas from logistics and merchandise to marketing.

124,"  * Company counting on large U.S. branch network, online business* First-quarter earnings/share $0.37 vs est. $0.35* Reaffirms full-year profit forecast   (Adds CFO and analyst comment, background)By Neha DimriMay 1 Western Union Co, the world's largest money-transfer company, is counting on its huge U.S. branch network to fend off looming competition from Wal-Mart Stores Inc.The company's interim chief financial officer, Raj Agrawal, also told Reuters on Thursday that competition from the world's biggest retailer would not force Western Union to become more aggressive on pricing.Wal-Mart said last month it would launch a money transfer service to broaden the financial services it offers to its low-income customers and boost store traffic.Western Union has already cut prices and invested heavily in its online and mobile businesses to better compete with fast-growing rivals such as MoneyGram International Inc, Xoom Corp and privately owned Boom Financial Inc.Agrawal, speaking after Western Union reported a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit, noted that his company had 46,000 U.S. locations, compared with Wal-Mart's 4,000, and that it operated in big cities and high traffic areas. ""So we provide convenience that customers cannot find with a Big Box store type of offering,"" he said, questioning whether customers would give up convenience to save a few dollars.Customers of the Wal-Mart service will be able to transfer $50 for a fee of $4.50, compared with $5.00 at Western Union.Unlike Western Union, Wal-Mart will not offer online transactions or transfers at its international locations.Western Union reaffirmed its full-year earnings forecast, unlike MoneyGram, which slashed its profit forecast earlier this week, citing Wal-Mart's entry into the market.Western Union, like is rivals, is facing increased compliance costs as regulators crack down on money laundering. However, Agrawal said Western Union was in a stronger position to absorb the increased costs, which in the long term would give it a competitive advantage.BTIG analyst Mark Palmer agreed. ""Western Union is poised to take market share from competitors unable to adjust to industry-wide compliance cost increases,"" he said in a research note.Western Union, which has about 20,000 locations in Russia and 15,000 in Ukraine, said it had not seen any material impact so far as from the crisis in the region.Western Union said in March it had suspended its services for Russia's Bank Rossiya after the imposition of U.S. sanctions. The company derives about 2 percent of its revenue from its Russian operations. EARNINGS BEAT ESTIMATES Western Union's better-than-expected results reflected a 9 percent rise in volumes in the company's consumer-to-consumer business to 60.24 million in the first quarter ended March 31.Consumer-to-consumer transactions account for about 80 percent of the company's revenue, with the rest coming from consumer payments to businesses and payments between businesses.Westernunion.com's consumer-to-consumer transactions increased 55 percent in the quarter.Western Union, which gets most of its business from migrant workers sending money home, said its net income fell 4 percent to $203 million, or 37 cents per share, in the first quarter, mainly due to a rise in expenses. Revenue rose 2 percent to $1.35 billion.Analysts expected Western Union to earn 35 cents per share on revenue of $1.36 billion.Western Union's shares were trading at $16.00 in extended trading after closing at $15.85 on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.

125,"   By Jonathan Stempel  A U.S. judge said Wal-Mart Stores Inc does not deserve dismissal of a lawsuit claiming it defrauded shareholders by concealing suspected corruption at its Mexico operations, even after learning that a damaging media report detailing alleged bribery was being prepared.U.S. Magistrate Judge Erin Setser in Fayetteville, Arkansas, on Thursday recommended denying Wal-Mart's request to dismiss the lawsuit led by a Michigan pension fund against the world's largest retailer and former Chief Executive Officer Mike Duke.A Wal-Mart spokesman said the company disagrees with Setser's recommendation, which is subject to review by U.S. District Judge Susan Hickey. District judges are not bound by magistrate judges' recommendations but often follow them.Wal-Mart's stock price, which is not known as particularly volatile, fell 8.2 percent in the three days after The New York Times reported on its investigation into the alleged bribery on April 22, 2012. That decline wiped out roughly $17 billion of market value. The Times' coverage later won a Pulitzer Prize.Plaintiffs, led by the City of Pontiac General Employees' Retirement System, alleged that Duke and other Wal-Mart officials knew as early as 2005 that the Walmart de Mexico unit might have been bribing local officials to open stores faster, but did not probe the matter adequately in 2005 and 2006. They said Wal-Mart should have ""come clean"" in a quarterly report filed on December 8, 2011, soon after it had learned of the Times' investigation.Instead, they said the report, known as a 10-Q, was a ""phony demonstration of vigilance and virtue"" that made it appear that Wal-Mart learned of suspected corruption in 2011, addressed it appropriately, and reported its findings to the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission.Setser said in light of later developments, reasonable investors would have viewed the 2005 and 2006 events as significant. These included an October 15, 2005, email to Duke, who then led Wal-Mart's international operations, from Wal-Mart's general counsel summarizing the alleged corruption. ""Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that defendants knew the omission in the December 2011 Form 10-Q of the 2005 revelation of the suspected corruption and defendants' 2005 and 2006 investigation was materially misleading,"" Setser wrote.Wal-Mart faces probes by U.S. and Mexican investigators into the alleged bribery, including whether the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The U.S. Congress also investigated the matter. ""We're very encouraged, and hopefully Judge Hickey agrees with the findings,"" said Jason Forge, a Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd partner representing the plaintiffs. ""Once Wal-Mart knew the Times was hot on its trail, and that there was enough substance to the allegations that it needed to tell the DOJ and the SEC, it needed to tell investors.""Wal-Mart spokesman Randy Hargrove said, ""We respectfully disagree with the magistrate judge's opinion, and continue to believe that the complaint does not meet the standard necessary to move the case forward.""The lawsuit seeks class-action status for the December 8, 2011, to April 20, 2012, period.

127,"  (Repeats article published on Sunday. No changes to text.)By John RuwitchSHENZHEN, China May 11 When Wang Yafang was fired from her job at a Walmart in southern China in July 2011 for dishonesty, she refused to sign the termination papers and even showed up at work the next day - only to be sent away.Wang, 38, then sued Walmart Shen Guo Tou Stores Inc, a Wal-Mart Stores Inc subsidiary, for wrongful termination, and beat the world's largest retailer in arbitration and twice in court, winning 48,636 yuan ($7,800) in damages.Now, she's aiming at an even bigger target: the state-backed All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU).In the three decades since China began reforming its economy, its giant state labour union - with upwards of 280 million members - has sat on the sidelines, rarely intervening on behalf of workers in disputes.In a bid to help change that, Wang, backed by lawyers who have handled some of China's highest-profile labour cases, decided to sue the union branch at the Walmart in Shenzhen where she worked for nine years. Unlike the few previous attempts by workers to sue grassroots union branches, courts have heard Wang's case.Wang and her team argue that the union endorsed the assessment of her as ""dishonest"" when she was fired and in doing so damaged her reputation. She wants an apology. The union branch has denied the charges.Beneath the surface, Wang and her lawyers are levelling a more serious accusation - one echoed by many Chinese workers - that the ACFTU is failing in its role as the protector of worker rights and interests.The landmark case highlights shifting labour relations in China, where workers increasingly know their rights and are seizing opportunities to challenge the status quo, often in court. Independent unions are banned in China, and the ACFTU is coming under unprecedented pressure to adapt.Two courts in Shenzhen have already heard Wang's case since she filed the suit last July, and have ruled against her. This month or next, her lawyers plan to launch a final appeal with the Guangdong superior people's court.""Either way, if she wins or loses, it is already extremely meaningful that this case has been brought to trial,"" said Shi Zhigang, a former union boss from Nanjing who now acts as a collective bargaining adviser to local union branches.""It's an amazing development that the courts have even accepted the case and are using Chinese law to make an assessment and evaluation of the union.""MEDICAL LEAVE, HONG KONG TRIP  On July 8, 2011, Wang twisted her back after watering plants at the Xiangmihu Walmart store, one of about 20 Walmarts in Shenzhen, the former cashier from China's western province of Gansu told Reuters.A doctor at a nearby hospital advised that she take medical leave to July 11, and her leave was approved by Walmart, court documents show. The next day, a Saturday, Wang and a friend crossed into neighbouring Hong Kong to attend a labour rights training course at a local university.She returned to work as scheduled, but near the end of her shift about a week later, on July 18, Wang was summoned by a human resources manager and sacked for ""dishonest behaviour"", having attended the training course during her medical leave.""I couldn't believe this was really happening,"" said Wang, who says she was a model worker, never arriving late to work or leaving early. In court documents, her lawyers refer to multiple commendations and awards she won on the job. ""I felt that firing me for that reason was groundless.

128,"   By John Ruwitch | SHENZHEN, China  SHENZHEN, China When Wang Yafang was fired from her job at a Walmart in southern China in July 2011 for dishonesty, she refused to sign the termination papers and even showed up at work the next day - only to be sent away.Wang, 38, then sued Walmart Shen Guo Tou Stores Inc, a Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) subsidiary, for wrongful termination, and beat the world's largest retailer in arbitration and twice in court, winning 48,636 yuan ($7,800) in damages.Now, she's aiming at an even bigger target: the state-backed All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU).In the three decades since China began reforming its economy, its giant state labor union - with upwards of 280 million members - has sat on the sidelines, rarely intervening on behalf of workers in disputes.In a bid to help change that, Wang, backed by lawyers who have handled some of China's highest-profile labor cases, decided to sue the union branch at the Walmart in Shenzhen where she worked for nine years. Unlike the few previous attempts by workers to sue grassroots union branches, courts have heard Wang's case.Wang and her team argue that the union endorsed the assessment of her as ""dishonest"" when she was fired and in doing so damaged her reputation. She wants an apology. The union branch has denied the charges.Beneath the surface, Wang and her lawyers are leveling a more serious accusation - one echoed by many Chinese workers - that the ACFTU is failing in its role as the protector of worker rights and interests.The landmark case highlights shifting labor relations in China, where workers increasingly know their rights and are seizing opportunities to challenge the status quo, often in court. Independent unions are banned in China, and the ACFTU is coming under unprecedented pressure to adapt.Two courts in Shenzhen have already heard Wang's case since she filed the suit last July, and have ruled against her. This month or next, her lawyers plan to launch a final appeal with the Guangdong superior people's court.""Either way, if she wins or loses, it is already extremely meaningful that this case has been brought to trial,"" said Shi Zhigang, a former union boss from Nanjing who now acts as a collective bargaining adviser to local union branches.""It's an amazing development that the courts have even accepted the case and are using Chinese law to make an assessment and evaluation of the union.""MEDICAL LEAVE, HONG KONG TRIP On July 8, 2011, Wang twisted her back after watering plants at the Xiangmihu Walmart store, one of about 20 Walmarts in Shenzhen, the former cashier from China's western province of Gansu told Reuters. A doctor at a nearby hospital advised that she take medical leave to July 11, and her leave was approved by Walmart, court documents show. The next day, a Saturday, Wang and a friend crossed into neighboring Hong Kong to attend a labor rights training course at a local university.She returned to work as scheduled, but near the end of her shift about a week later, on July 18, Wang was summoned by a human resources manager and sacked for ""dishonest behavior"", having attended the training course during her medical leave.""I couldn't believe this was really happening,"" said Wang, who says she was a model worker, never arriving late to work or leaving early.

Even dollar stores have been hurt by a slowdown in spending by low and middle income consumers.Family Dollar Stores Inc said in April it would cut jobs and shut hundreds of stores after second-quarter comparable sales fell 3.8 percent.Wal-Mart's healthcare costs are also surging as thousands of employees sign up for benefits. The company, which has more than 2 million employees, said healthcare costs were expected to be $300 million this year.The company did not release healthcare costs for last year. The weak outlook also reflects increased investment in its Sam's Club stores and the e-commerce business.Wal-Mart said it expects second-quarter earnings of $1.15-$1.25 per share from continuing operations, missing the average analyst estimate of $1.28 per share.First-quarter profit fell 5 percent to $3.59 billion.Wal-Mart, like other retailers, blamed its weak sales on a harsher-than-usual winter in much of the United States. The winter storms not only made it difficult for shoppers to visit Wal-Mart's stores, mainly located on the outskirts of towns and cities, but also disrupted the company's supply chain.Wal-Mart, which operates in 10 countries, said its tax rate was also higher than expected at about 34 percent. The company did not say why the tax rate, which was 32.9 percent for the year ended Jan. 31, 2014, was higher than anticipated.The top U.S. corporate tax rate is 35 percent but many companies pay much less than this.Wal-Mart's U.S. same-store sales were relatively flat. The company earned $1.10 per share from continuing operations, missing the average analyst estimate of $1.15 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company said the severe winter impacted earnings per share by about 3 cents.E-commerce sales rose 27 percent.Total revenue rose 0.8 percent to $114.96 billion, with  currency fluctuations hurting net sales by about $1.6 billion.Wal-Mart's revenue growth has not dropped below 1 percent since the second quarter of fiscal 2010, when it reported a decline of 1.4 percent.

""Our strategy is working, we are certainly performing ahead of Morrisons, Tesco and Sainsbury's and the losses that we were seeing to the discount market are very clearly mitigated,"" Asda Chief Executive Andy Clarke told reporters on Thursday.Asda, whose everyday low-price deals include a loaf of Warburtons bread for 1 pound, said sales at stores open more than a year, excluding fuel, rose 0.1 percent in the 15 weeks to April 20, its fiscal first quarter, compared with the same period last year, returning to growth after a 0.1 percent decline in its previous Christmas quarter. Total sales rose 1.3 percent.Pledges to cut prices have also come from Tesco and Morrisons, while Sainsbury has vowed to remain competitive, raising analysts' concerns about a possible price war hitting margins and earnings across the industry.Asked if a grocery price war was being waged, Clarke said: ""Not from my perspective ... We are in control of our agenda and not knee-jerking and reacting to what others may decide to do."" Chief Financial Officer Alex Russo said Asda's price cuts in the first quarter had narrowed the gap with discounters and widened the gap versus its three big rivals.SLOWEST RATE  Data from market researcher Kantar Worldpanel last week showed UK grocery sales growing at their slowest rate for at least 11 years over the past three months, reflecting price cuts and easing food price inflation.That data showed the 579-store Asda was the best performing of Britain's big four grocers.Last week Morrison, which issued a profit warning in March, posted a 7.1 percent slump in first quarter like-for-like sales.Asda set out its strategic priorities for the next five years last November. The firm wants to improve its core business and increase its reach and access though the development of its online offer and the opening of more stores, particularly in London and the southeast of England, where it is relatively under represented.The grocer also said on Thursday it planned a new store management structure that removes some department manager roles and creates new deputy manager, trading manager and section manager roles and additional section leader roles.The proposals, which are subject to worker consultation, involve around 4,100 managers but will create 5,000 roles, it said. Asda declined to comment on projected cost savings from the move.Wal-Mart on Thursday reported a 5 percent drop in quarterly profit as a severe winter in the United States kept shoppers from its stores.

143,"  HONG KONG May 20 The China operating arm of U.S. retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc said on Tuesday it planned to invest 580 million yuan ($92.99 million) to remodel 55 existing stores in China this year to enhance store operations and optimize customer experience.Wal-Mart China also said it will open about 30 high-quality stores and additional distribution centers in China this year as part of its three-year growth plan announced last October.China is key to Wal-Mart's international ambitions but it has stumbled in a market where consumers value safe and authentic food over the low prices for which the retailer is known. The announcement comes almost a month after Wal-Mart appointed a new chief executive for the China region, where the world's largest retailer is battling stiff competition from local rivals. Sean Clarke, current chief operating officer in China, will take over the China CEO role from June 1. The U.S. retailer, which operates about 400 units in China, said last October that it would open up to 110 facilities in the country between 2014 and 2016 and was looking to close 15-30 others over the next 18 months as part of a rationalization process in the country. Its local rival, Sun Art Retail Group Ltd, said in March it would continue to maintain steady new store expansion after China's top hypermarket operator posted a 15.2 percent rise in 2013 net profit with an expanding store network helping it shrug off an economic slowdown.($1 = 6.2374 Chinese yuan)   (Reporting by Donny Kwok; Editing by Matt Driskill)",2014-05-20,WMT,"Tue May 20, 2014 | 2:57am EDT","Wal-Mart China to upgrade stores for $93 mln, open 30 more in 2014",http://www.reuters.com//article/walmart-china-idUSL3N0O61P420140520?type=companyNews
144,"   By James B. Kelleher  When Walmart pledged last year to buy an extra $250 billion in U.S.-made goods over the next decade, it appeared to be just what was needed to help move America's putative manufacturing renaissance from rhetoric to reality. But suppliers trying to reshore production as part of the initiative by the world's largest retailer are running into practical problems as they try to restart long-idled corners of  U.S. manufacturing.Companies that make the leap have to grapple with a host of challenges, including a shallow pool of component suppliers, an inexperienced workforce, and other shortcomings that developed during the country's long industrial decline.""A lot of the tribal knowledge and skill sets are gone because the humans who used to do that work have either retired or died,"" says H. Kim Kelley, the CEO of Hampton Products International, a privately held maker of locks, lighting and other household hardware. The Foothill Ranch, California-based company began selling products made in Asia to Walmart in the 1990s and is now supplying it with some U.S.-made products.Trying to rebuild that manufacturing capability, while making products that meet Walmart's standards, can require companies to “start from scratch,” Kelley says.Cindi Marsiglio, the Walmart vice president overseeing the U.S. sourcing push, says the retailer and its existing suppliers have 150 active reshoring projects in various stages of development. For all too many, she says, finding U.S.-made component parts has emerged as a vexing problem. Hampton, which also makes tow straps, tie-downs and bungee cords for the automotive market, had a hard time locating a U.S. maker of lightweight but strong polyester yarn. Marsiglio says other suppliers complain of difficulty finding small motors, as well as plastic injection molding equipment and computerized cut-and-sew tools.The issue is so widespread that Walmart is making it the focus of a two-day summit it is hosting in August in Denver. At a similar summit held in Orlando last year, Walmart focused on connecting suppliers with economic development officers from states hoping to lure the new factories. The retailer says it is especially interested in having factory owners with excess capacity attend the August event - even those that aren't interested in supplying Walmart directly. The hope is that they can become contract manufacturers to Walmart suppliers looking to produce in the United States.On July 8, it is also inviting hundreds of potential vendors to an ""open call"" to pitch U.S.-made products to the retailer in Bentonville, Arkansas, where it is based. SHUT PLANTS Walmart's critics say the company bears some responsibility for the diminished capability of U.S. manufacturers. For years, its relentless insistence that suppliers cut costs prompted companies to shut domestic plants and shift production to low-wage countries.Now, the retailer is asking companies to come back home - though they need little prompting. The forces pulling production back to the United States are powerful and real and include lower domestic energy prices, increasingly competitive wage rates, the benefits of greater automation, and a renewed appreciation for the value of being able to respond quickly to shifting U.S. customer demands. Still, starting up a manufacturing operation is a complex undertaking, especially for vendors like Hampton and Redman & Associates, an Arkansas-based toymaker. Last year, Redman sold 1.1 million battery-powered ride-on toys, such as large toy cars, in the United States - every one of them made in Chinese contract plants. By 2016, the privately held company plans to be producing about 600,000 of those toys each year out of a brand-new company-owned and run plant in the U.S. Mel Redman, the company's CEO and chairman, says the transition has required the company to reverse engineer everything its Chinese contractors were doing - an exercise that wasn't easy given his executive team's background in retail.“We didn’t know much about manufacturing – we didn’t know anything about it really,” he says.SHIPPING COSTS Walmart declines to say how many products it has introduced as a result of the 18-month-old Made in USA initiative. But the company says consumers can now buy everything from U.S.-made flat-screen TVs, light bulbs and towels and curtains in its stores and on its website.The flat-screen TVs, made in Winnsboro, South Carolina by Element Electronics, may be the campaign’s biggest surprise to date.  Founded in 2007, Element had until this year made all its TVs in Asia - but it was unable to get them on Walmart's shelves because there was nothing that differentiated them from rivals' products, says CEO Mike O'Shaughnessy. “So we began to think about what we could do differently. Well, one of the things we could do differently is to make our TVs at home,” he says.Element built a small test plant in Michigan that began producing flat-screen TVs shortly before Walmart announced the Made in USA push in January 2013. The announcement prompted the company to fast-track its expansion. Today, Element’s 315,000-square-foot plant in South Carolina has six assembly lines making 32- and 40-inch TVs that are now available in all of Walmart's more than 4,000 U.S. stores.The switch has led to significant savings in ocean freight charges and customs duties on finished goods - though like so many companies involved in the initiative Element has had difficulty finding domestic suppliers. ""We import the vast majority of our parts,"" says O'Shaughnessy. ""Longer term, the more success we have procuring our parts domestically, the better off we expect to be."" Although Walmart has given itself 10 years to meet its $250 billion goal, Marsiglio says the retailer hopes to meet the target ahead of schedule. She says the point of the ""open call"" next month is to simplify a product pitching process that can challenge even long-time suppliers. But while the door is open, the bar is high and Walmart will require any applicants to open their financial books as part of the screening process. Given Walmart’s reputation as a tough negotiator with suppliers, the disclosure of sensitive financial information to the retailer requires a leap of faith. But Element's O'Shaughnessy said his company had no misgivings about opening its books. Walmart needs to know it can rely on its vendors, he said. “What does it cost to produce product? What does it cost to move product? Every one of the variables that make up the cost of the product we (shared) with Walmart,” he says.

146,"   By James B. Kelleher | June 4  June 4 When Walmart pledged last year to buy an extra $250 billion in U.S.-made goods over the next decade, it appeared to be just what was needed to help move America's putative manufacturing renaissance from rhetoric to reality.But suppliers trying to reshore production as part of the initiative by the world's largest retailer are running into practical problems as they try to restart long-idled corners of  U.S. manufacturing.Companies that make the leap have to grapple with a host of challenges, including a shallow pool of component suppliers, an inexperienced workforce, and other shortcomings that developed during the country's long industrial decline.""A lot of the tribal knowledge and skill sets are gone because the humans who used to do that work have either retired or died,"" says H. Kim Kelley, the CEO of Hampton Products International, a privately held maker of locks, lighting and other household hardware. The Foothill Ranch, California-based company began selling products made in Asia to Walmart in the 1990s and is now supplying it with some U.S.-made products.Trying to rebuild that manufacturing capability, while making products that meet Walmart's standards, can require companies to ""start from scratch,"" Kelley says.Cindi Marsiglio, the Walmart vice president overseeing the U.S. sourcing push, says the retailer and its existing suppliers have 150 active reshoring projects in various stages of development. For all too many, she says, finding U.S.-made component parts has emerged as a vexing problem.Hampton, which also makes tow straps, tie-downs and bungee cords for the automotive market, had a hard time locating a U.S. maker of lightweight but strong polyester yarn. Marsiglio says other suppliers complain of difficulty finding small motors, as well as plastic injection molding equipment and computerized cut-and-sew tools.The issue is so widespread that Walmart is making it the focus of a two-day summit it is hosting in August in Denver. At a similar summit held in Orlando last year, Walmart focused on connecting suppliers with economic development officers from states hoping to lure the new factories.The retailer says it is especially interested in having factory owners with excess capacity attend the August event - even those that aren't interested in supplying Walmart directly. The hope is that they can become contract manufacturers to Walmart suppliers looking to produce in the United States.On July 8, it is also inviting hundreds of potential vendors to an ""open call"" to pitch U.S.-made products to the retailer in Bentonville, Arkansas, where it is based. SHUT PLANTS Walmart's critics say the company bears some responsibility for the diminished capability of U.S. manufacturers. For years, its relentless insistence that suppliers cut costs prompted companies to shut domestic plants and shift production to low-wage countries.Now, the retailer is asking companies to come back home - though they need little prompting. The forces pulling production back to the United States are powerful and real and include lower domestic energy prices, increasingly competitive wage rates, the benefits of greater automation, and a renewed appreciation for the value of being able to respond quickly to shifting U.S. customer demands.Still, starting up a manufacturing operation is a complex undertaking, especially for vendors like Hampton and Redman & Associates, an Arkansas-based toymaker. Last year, Redman sold 1.1 million battery-powered ride-on toys, such as large toy cars, in the United States - every one of them made in Chinese contract plants. By 2016, the privately held company plans to be producing about 600,000 of those toys each year out of a brand-new company-owned and run plant in the U.S.Mel Redman, the company's CEO and chairman, says the transition has required the company to reverse engineer everything its Chinese contractors were doing - an exercise that wasn't easy given his executive team's background in retail.""We didn't know much about manufacturing - we didn't know anything about it really,"" he says.SHIPPING COSTS  Walmart declines to say how many products it has introduced as a result of the 18-month-old Made in USA initiative.

149,"   By Siddharth Cavale and Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Wal-Mart Stores Inc appointed Gregory Penner as vice chairman, showing again that the world's largest retailer is looking at younger executives to revive its fortunes.The appointment of 44-year-old Penner puts him in a position to succeed Chairman Rob Walton, his 69-year-old father-in-law. Penner, who has been on Wal-Mart's board since 2008, is a general partner at Madrone Capital Partners, according to Wal-Mart's website. From 2002 to 2005, he was Wal-Mart's senior vice president and the chief financial officer of its Japan unit. The announcement, made in Wal-Mart's annual shareholder meeting on Friday, comes at a time when the company's U.S. same-store sales are falling and it struggles to get beyond a bribery scandal at its Mexico unit that cost it more than $500 million since 2012.Wal-Mart is also facing increasing dissent from its employees who, backed by unions, are demanding higher wages, better benefits and more full-time jobs. The company appointed Doug McMillon, 47, as its chief executive in November to help stanch the fall in sales and improve its image following the Mexico scandal. He took the helm in February, replacing 64-year-old Mike Duke.Wal-Mart said on Friday it was doubling down on small-format stores, typically one quarter the size of its supercenters, to broaden its customer base and fend off aggressive rivals. The company, which operates nearly 350 smaller stores, said it would build 200 more Neighborhood Market stores and 80-100 Wal-Mart Express stores this fiscal year, Wal-Mart U.S. business head Bill Simon said in the shareholder meeting.        There have been concerns about how Wal-Mart is dealing with its core low-income customer base, which has struggled with a cut in food stamps and higher gas prices, and online competition from Amazon.com.    The company also said it would move fast on investing in technology to boost sales in e-commerce, its fastest growing business.     KEEP IT IN THE FAMILY The move to appoint Penner as heir apparent highlights the Walton family's attempts to reinforce its control over the company founded by Rob Walton's father, Sam Walton. The Walton family controlled 51 percent of Wal-Mart as of April 4. The appointment aroused shareholder concerns about the company's indifference to growing criticism.Some shareholders proposed the appointment of an independent chairman and sought disclosures on whether the company had recovered pay from executives involved in frauds.They also sought transparency on whether the company was lobbying against a federal proposal to raise minimum wages.  These demands were voted down on Friday. ""There's no chance a (shareholder) proposal will be approved given the controlling stake of the Walton family,"" CtW Investment Group analyst Michael Pryce-Jones told Reuters.Pryce-Jones, however, said Wal-Mart would find it difficult to ignore shareholder concerns as its performance suffers.CtW Investment works with pension funds who own 4 million shares of Wal-Mart.

152,"  LAS VEGAS Two armed suspects shouting ""this is a revolution"" opened fire on two Las Vegas police officers eating lunch in a pizza parlor on Sunday, then shot and killed a civilian inside a nearby Wal-Mart store before killing themselves, police said.Local media in Las Vegas reported later that both officers had died, but this could not be immediately confirmed.The two suspects, whose gender, age or identity were not immediately provided by authorities, walked into a CiCi's Pizza shop at about 11:30 a.m. local time and immediately ambushed the uniformed patrol officers, then took the officers' weapons and ran across the street to the Wal-Mart, city police spokeswoman Laura Meltzer told Reuters.As they entered the Wal-Mart, the suspects shot to death a person near the entrance, then continued further into the store and ""engaged in what is being described as a suicide pact,"" Meltzer said. She said the two assailants were believed to be the only suspects involved in the shootings, and ""we do not believe there is any further danger to the public."" She had no information about the kind of weapons they carried into the pizza shop.Police offered no explanation for a motive behind the ambush and subsequent shooting, but Meltzer said one or both of the suspects yelled a statement to the effect that ""This is a revolution"" as they carried out the attack. The two officers shot in the ambush were taken to a hospital, but Meltzer said she had no information on their condition. The Las Vegas Review-Journal newspaper said the two assailants were a man and a woman.

He is expected to make his first court appearance on Wednesday.Wal-Mart said it believes Roper was operating ""within the federal hours of service regulations,"" according to a statement released by spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan. The company did not respond to a request for Roper's itinerary. Morgan, best known for his roles on ""30 Rock"" and ""Saturday Night Live,"" remained in critical but stable condition on Monday, recovering from a broken leg, ribs and nose, his spokesman Lewis Kay said in a statement.""His fiancée Megan is by his side. This recovery will be arduous,"" the statement said.Comic James McNair, 62, who performed under the name ""Jimmy Mack,"" died at the scene. Two other passengers in the van were also in critical condition at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Center in New Brunswick, New Jersey, said spokeswoman Zenaida Mendez. State police said Roper failed to see traffic slowing in front of him as he drove on the New Jersey Turnpike early on Saturday near Cranbury Township. His truck slammed into the limo bus carrying Morgan, 45, and several other comics and friends, who were coming from a performance in Delaware.The impact flipped the Mercedes limo on its roof and caused a chain-reaction crash involving four other vehicles. Roper, of Jonesboro, Georgia, was unhurt in the crash.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said driving with too little sleep causes more than 100,000 crashes a year, resulting in 40,000 injuries and 1,550 deaths.Operators of commercial vehicles are restricted to driving a maximum of 11 hours a day after spending a minimum of 10 hours off duty, according to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.In its statement, Wal-Mart said its 7,175 drivers must meet some of the highest safety standards in the industry. The statement did not list the number of accidents involving Wal-Mart trucks.A CBS News report, which cited federal data, said that Wal-Mart trucks have been involved in 380 crashes over the last two years, leading to nine deaths and 129 injuries.

156,"   By Cynthia Johnston | LAS VEGAS  LAS VEGAS A married couple who shot dead two Las Vegas police officers in a weekend pizza parlor ambush harbored anti-government and white supremacist ideology and threw a swastika on the body of one of the officers they gunned down, police said on Monday.The couple are believed to have acted alone on Sunday when they killed the lunching policemen before heading to a nearby Walmart, where they killed a bystander who tried to stop them. Later, surrounded by police, 22-year-old Amanda Miller shot and killed her 31-year-old husband, Jerad, then took her own life.“At this time we believe this is an isolated act,” Assistant Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill told a news conference. “There is no doubt that the suspects have some apparent ideology that’s along the lines of militia and white supremacist.”Information about the suspects gleaned from police and social media painted a picture of a pair with increasingly extremist views on government and law enforcement, culminating in an ominous Facebook post a day before the shooting.""The dawn of a new day. May all of our coming sacrifices be worth it,"" Jerad Miller posted on his Facebook page on Saturday.Police said the Millers, who were married in 2012 in Indiana, had expressed support in social media for renegade Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, and the husband claimed to have been present at the standoff between federal agents and militia members at Bundy's ranch in April, police said.McMahill said Jerad Miller wrote on Facebook that he had been ""kicked out"" of the Bundy ranch because of his criminal history and background. McMahill said investigators were still looking into the couple's ties to right-wing extremist groups. He said police had not yet confirmed whether Jerad Miller had turned up at the Bundy ranch, where federal agents and Bundy supporters clashed over a forced round-up of his cattle on public land.Local government records from Indiana's Tippecanoe County show Jerad Miller was charged with felony possession of marijuana in 2010. Police said he was also convicted of vehicle theft offenses in Washington state.A YouTube video channel Jerad Miller established consists mostly of footage of his cats and of himself crying and asking his wife to visit him in jail.Amanda Miller's Facebook page contains photos of the couple dressed as comic book villains The Joker and Harley Quinn, and the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported the couple were known to dress as characters and pose with tourists on Las Vegas' popular Fremont Street area. ANTI-GOVERNMENT EXTREMISTS Mark Pitcavage, director of investigative research for the Anti-Defamation League, which monitors hate groups, said the Millers appeared to be ""right-wing anti-government extremists of the 'Patriot' movement variety, believing in all the common militia-type conspiracy theories.""McMahill said police investigators believe they equated government and law enforcement with the Nazi movement and saw police as oppressors, even as they also appeared to subscribe to white supremacist ideology themselves. McMahill also revealed at a Monday news conference new details of the circumstances surrounding the fatal ambush of patrol officers Alyn Beck, 41, and Igor Soldo, 31, who were killed as they ate lunch in a pizza parlor booth.After shooting the officers, the couple placed atop Beck's body a replica of a Gadsden flag, a yellow Revolutionary War-era banner that bears an image of a coiled snake and the slogan ""Don't Tread on Me,"" McMahill said.He said the suspects also threw a swastika symbol on Beck's body and pinned a note to Soldo saying the attack was ""the beginning of the revolution,"" a phrase also heard by bystanders in the restaurant.The duo then grabbed the officers' weapons and fled to the Walmart, where Amanda Miller gunned down a bystander, Joseph Wilcox, who had tried to confront Jerad Miller with his own concealed weapon after the couple burst into the store shouting: ""This is a revolution.""The couple exchanged fire with police and retreated to the rear of the store, where Amanda Miller killed her spouse and herself, McMahill said.

157,"  LAS VEGAS Law enforcement officials are looking into whether a man and woman who killed two Las Vegas police officers and a third person before killing themselves Sunday had links to the white supremacy movement, according to a report on Monday.The Las Vegas Review-Journal, citing city law enforcement sources, said investigators discovered paraphernalia associated with white supremacists, including swastika symbols, but it was not clear where the items was found.The newspaper's report also said the shooters covered the officers' bodies with something featuring the Revolutionary War-era Gadsden flag. The yellow flag, which contains an image of a coiled snake and the words ""Don't tread on me,"" is associated with the conservative Tea Party political movement.Representatives for the Las Vegas Police Department said they could not confirm the report. A morning news conference is planned later on Monday. The armed man and woman shouted about a ""revolution"" before opening fire and killing the two uniformed patrol officers, Alyn Beck, 41, and Igor Soldo, 31, who were eating lunch in a CiCi's pizza parlor, police said on Sunday.One of the two officers managed to return gunfire before the suspects fled to an adjacent Wal-Mart, where they killed a bystander inside the front door, then exchanged gunfire with police who pursued them further into the store, Clark County Sheriff Douglas Gillespie said. Moments later, the female suspect shot her accomplice to death, then took her own life, Gillespie told reporters on Sunday. Beck had worked in the police department since August 2001 and was married, with three children. Soldo had been on the force since April 2006 and was married, with a baby.

169,"  (Adds comment, background on Wal-Mart and food safety concerns in China)BEIJING, June 17 The world's biggest retailer, Wal-Mart Stores Inc, said on Tuesday that it will increase its spending on food safety in China to 300 million yuan ($48.32 million) in 2013, 2014 and 2015, up from a previously-announced 100 million yuan in the same period.The company said it will also increase DNA testing on meat products and supplier inspections and test more of its stores with its two mobile safety labs.China's food and grocery market, which is set to top $1.5 trillion by 2016, is crucial for retailers like Wal-Mart and food safety is chief among consumer concerns.Wal-Mart, French grocer Carrefour SA, McDonald's Corp and KFC-parent Yum Brands Inc among others, have all been criticised on the issue, a sensitive topic in a country that has faced everything from melamine-tainted milk and cadmium-tainted rice to recycled ""gutter oil"" used for cooking. Wal-Mart's reputation for food safety in China came under attack earlier this year after its ""Five Spice"" donkey meat was found to contain fox meat.Greg Foran, then-president and CEO of Wal-Mart's China business, said at the time it was a good reminder to invest more in supplier management.Wal-Mart also ran into trouble in 2011 when it was fined for selling expired duck meat. Wal-Mart currently has about 7,000 food suppliers in China. It cut 4 percent of its suppliers in recent years for failing audits or DNA tests.Wal-Mart China Chief Compliance Officer Paul Gallemore told Reuters on Tuesday that ""we face similar challenges to all other retailers in China when it comes to sourcing products. We have zero tolerance"" for adulterated goods. Gallemore also said the company's contact with Chinese food safety regulators is currently on an ""ad hoc"" basis, but it hopes to have more regular meetings.Wal-Mart operates more than 400 facilities in China and competes with market leaders Sun Art Retail Group Ltd  and China Resources Enterprise Ltd, which last August teamed up with British retailer Tesco Plc.Wal-Mart said in October it would open up to 110 new facilities in China between 2014 and 2016 and was looking to close 15-30 others over the next 18 months.($1 = 6.2090 Chinese yuan)   (Reporting by the Beijing newsroom and Clare Baldwin in HONG KONG; Editing by Matt Driskill)",2014-06-17,WMT,"Tue Jun 17, 2014 | 6:33am EDT",UPDATE 1-Wal-Mart China to raise food safety spending to $48 million,http://www.reuters.com//article/walmart-china-food-safety-idUSL4N0OY1WH20140617?type=companyNews

171,"  June 20 Wal-Mart Stores Inc's Canadian business named Dirk Van den Berghe as its chief executive, effective Aug. 1, as it looks to strengthen its food business in the country.Van den Berghe joins Wal-Mart from supermarket group Delhaize , where he was CEO for the company's Belgium and Luxembourg operations.He succeeds Shelley Broader, who is now CEO of the retailer's operations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Canada. Van den Berghe will report to Broader, Wal-Mart Canada said.Wal-Mart is facing stiff competition in Canada as home-grown retailers Loblaw Cos Ltd and Metro Inc as well as U.S.-based chains such as Target Corp jostle for bigger slices of the crowded market. Wal-Mart has said it will invest about C$500 million ($461 million) this year to expand in Canada and plans to add 1 million square feet of retail space.Wal-Mart Canada operates 391 stores in the country that serve more than 1.2 million customers every day. Wal-Mart Stores said last month that comparable sales at Wal-Mart Canada declined in the first quarter, hurt by weak sales in its apparel and outdoor business due to an unusually cold winter.But sales in food and consumables in the country were strong and the company increased its market share. In May, Target fired the president of its money-losing Canadian operation and named a long-time U.S. executive with operational experience to try to repair its supply chain woes and win back customers.Target Canada's sales have been weak with shoppers complaining about empty shelves, higher prices and less selection than at U.S. Target stores, but Target has said it is acting aggressively to make more rapid improvement in Canada.Another rival, Sears Holdings Corp is looking to sell its 51 percent stake in Sears Canada Inc, a move that could trigger a deal for the entire Canadian operation.

172,"   By Nandita Bose | DHAKA  DHAKA It took Western safety inspectors only about an hour to tour a factory the size of three football fields before ordering a partial shutdown of Sonia & Sweaters Ltd, a Bangladesh clothing supplier to Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Debenhams (DEB.L).Two weeks later, the group that the inspectors represented changed its mind and allowed the factory to stay open, even though none of the repairs they suggested had been carried out.Such erratic decision-making poses a new set of problems for Bangladesh's $22 billion garments industry, whose safety record has been under the microscope since the collapse of a factory near Dhaka that killed more than 1,100 workers last year.More than a year after the public outcry that spurred Western retailers into demanding better standards from the factories that make their clothes, it also highlights the practical complexities of improving the conditions of millions of poor workers whilst also safeguarding their jobs.Export growth in the sector has slowed as buyers turn to India, Myanmar, Vietnam and Cambodia because of concerns over workshop safety, higher wages and political instability.Now factory owners say they are concerned about arbitrary shutdowns and meeting the cost of demands for remedial work, while workers worry about who will pay their wages if their workplace is temporarily closed.""We went through inexplicable harassment during this whole process, and I am sure they don't care about that,"" said Sonia & Sweaters Director Mahabubur Rahman, of his experience of the inspection.""But with their trigger-happy attitude, I am left wondering if they at least care about the workers, who they are meant to protect, because nobody has to explain to them what the implication of one factory shutdown is.""The garment industry accounts for 80 percent of Bangladesh's exports, and turmoil in the sector has put at risk the livelihoods of nearly 4 million garment workers, mostly women.FACTORY INSPECTIONS    The collapse of the eight-storey Rana Plaza building in April 2013 brutally exposed the inadequacy of the safety regime in Bangladesh, where 5,600 garment factories are inspected by different local agencies that often lack sufficient technical equipment and the required expertise.The disaster led to the creation of the Accord on Fire and Building Safety, an inspection group led by European retailers, and the North American brands-led Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, which together are scrutinizing around 2,100 factories.The groups, which have a mandate to recommend the closure of dangerous factories and demand repairs, are now embroiled in a debate over the inspection process and the question of who pays for upgrades and wages while factories stand idle.Making the situation worse, almost all global retail brands have opted to stay out of the arguments between inspection agencies and suppliers, according to industry officials. When the inspection groups were set up, retailers did not commit to pay for improvements they demanded - some Bangladesh factory owners are very wealthy and politically connected - but agreed to discuss assistance with wages and improvements if owners could not afford them.Wal-Mart spokesman Kevin Gardner said, as a founding member of the Alliance, the company's contributions have made funds available to help factory owners make necessary repairs and to support workers who may be temporarily displaced.This includes an initial worker safety fund of nearly $50 million and growing, and more than $100 million in access to low-cost capital funding to improve fire and structural safety. Debenhams declined to comment.  SAFETY SHUTDOWNS Reuters obtained copies of two inspection reports on Sonia & Sweaters which showed the factory's civil engineer tried to warn Accord inspectors that their assessment that insufficient steel had been used in the building columns was inaccurate.The steel was later found to be adequate for operations to continue.Company managers told Reuters that documents on the building's load-bearing capacity sent to the inspectors after their assessment were overlooked. That oversight was only acknowledged after the factory's senior management physically carried the documents to the Accord's Dhaka office.The Accord assessed the number of steel bars in each column as 14-20, the lower range of which would be considered unsafe, whereas company officials said it was 32-35. ""We advised them to close down the top floor immediately and go for a detailed engineering analysis,"" Brad Loewen, chief safety inspector of the Accord, said.Loewen said the owners returned and challenged the numbers with their own documents. The Accord stuck with its findings, but decided to consider the steel strength of each column was 20 bars, at the top of its range, rather than 14, which meant operations could continue, he said.Sonia & Sweaters had cleared a safety inspection by Wal-Mart in 2013, according to a report published by the U.S. retailer in November last year.The Western inspection groups, between them, have so far shut 14 factories and asked five factories to partially close, according to government data.  Senior advisor to the Alliance Ian Spaulding said the group has been careful with the issue of factory shutdowns and has been working closely with the government on the issue. Five factories have been shut down as a result of their recommendations, he said.   FOREIGN VS LOCAL The legal authority to shut factories rests with the Bangladesh government, and decisions to do so are reviewed by a government-appointed panel that includes one member each from the Accord and Alliance and two civil engineers from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET).That process has led to friction between local and foreign members.Four Wings Ltd, a factory that supplies clothes to Swedish fashion retailer Hennes & Mauritz (H&M) (HMb.ST), was closed down on the recommendation of Accord inspectors who feared the load-bearing capacity of the building was inadequate.The two BUET engineers on the review panel opposed an immediate closure, but were stopped from making recommendations and asked instead for an opinion with either a ""yes"" or a ""no"", according to a senior official at Four Wings and a professor from BUET who had direct knowledge of events. Both spoke on condition of anonymity.""Everybody appreciates the fact that they are working hard to make this industry safe, but everybody they are working with will agree they are extremely arrogant and have a high-handed attitude,"" said the BUET professor.Ananta Garments Ltd's Mirpur factory, which employs 1,600 workers, was also shut down by the Accord on concerns over the buildings load-bearing capacity. ""They found problems, they shut it down and we realized the repairs they have suggested will take eight months,"" said Inamul Haque Khan, managing director of Ananta Garments. ""Nobody had an answer to what happens to the workers, who pays their salaries.""He said he would pay workers' salaries for one more month before laying them off as he could not afford to pay more.Several garment factory owners said they were already absorbing most of a 79-percent increase in the minimum monthly wage to $68 that was imposed by the government last December, because global brands are baulking at paying higher prices. WHO PAYS? The Alliance has decided to share wage costs for two months and is currently holding discussions to extend it to four months. It is in the final stages of making available low-cost loans for repairs at five to seven factories, Spaulding said.The Accord requires factory owners to pay for repairs and  wages for six months. They are expected to discuss with their brands, who will ensure resources are available, Loewen said.   But about a dozen garment factory owners Reuters spoke to said the Western brands they supplied had not got involved in talks over paying the bills. This was despite several rounds of discussions involving factory owners, government officials, unions and Accord and Alliance members.H&M, the first signatory to the Accord, said it was actively participating in remediation processes involving its suppliers.Spokeswoman Andrea Roos said H&M discussed resource availability with all involved parties on a case-by-case basis. Two of H&M's supplier factories have undergone minor construction work as a result of inspections, she said.French retailer Auchan, which also sources garments in Bangladesh, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Softex Cotton, which supplies Auchan, was shut down by the Accord due to doubts over the factory's load-carrying capacity, but later allowed to resume partial operations, even though no repairs had been made.Softex is now suing the Accord, challenging its legal right to close factories and demanding $100 million in damages to business and reputation, according to a copy of a lawsuit filed in a Dhaka court seen by Reuters.Softex's factory was vandalized by workers after the sudden closure notice was issued and the company says it has been forced to take a loan to keep paying workers' salaries.""When there is a problem we are being notified, sometimes not even in a proper way, and then being left to our own devices, which is just not right,"" said Rezwan Selim, managing director of Softex Cotton.($1 = 77.4800 Bangladeshi Takas) (Additional reporting by Clare Baldwin in Hong Kong, James Davey in London, Dominique Vidalon in Paris and Anna Ringstrom in Stockholm; Editing by John Chalmers and Alex Richardson)",2014-06-24,WMT,"Mon Jun 23, 2014 | 11:44pm EDT",Inspection tensions add to Bangladesh garment industry's woes,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-bangladesh-textiles-insight-idUSKBN0EZ08J20140624?type=companyNews

174,"   By John Ruwitch | SHANGHAI, June 26  SHANGHAI, June 26 Former employees are preparing to sue Wal-Mart in China after an arbitration committee rejected their case for better compensation than the company has offered after closing the store where they worked in central Hunan province.Dozens of workers challenged the way that Wal-Mart Stores Inc closed the underperforming store in the city of Changde in March and attempted negotiations for better compensation before turning to arbitration.Labour activists, scholars and lawyers have closely followed the case because the store's branch of the state-run All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) has taken the unusual step of leading the protest.Critics say the ACFTU - the only legal union in China - has long prioritised stability over worker's rights and interests, and has a history of sitting out disputes or siding with management.An arbitration committee heard the case over a two-day period late last month and issued its decision on Wednesday turning down the workers' arbitration requests. Meanwhile, Changde's neighbourhood committees - grassroots arms of the government - have pressured the workers to accept an offer from Wal-Mart of 3,000 yuan ($480) each and end the dispute, workers said.Huang Xingguo, the store's union boss who has been leading the challenge, said on Thursday that most had come around to accepting the deal and only 18 were left preparing to continue the fight.""It doesn't matter, though. The law won't change because the number of people goes up or down,"" he said. Still, he was unhappy after the arbitration result.""I feel like workers will always be at the bottom rung in the face of capital, the government and the union, and we will always have a weak voice,"" Huang said.Wal-Mart closed the Changde store as part of plans to restructure in China. It said in October it planned to shut 15-30 China stores through 2016 while opening up to 110 and creating nearly 19,000 jobs as part of efforts to revitalise its business. Employees say there were not given proper notice or compensation when the company decided to close the Changde store.A Wal-Mart spokesman has said the company was fully compliant with the law and had the support of the local government.Former worker Zhou Zhigang said the remaining workers were asking for a payoff of two times their monthly salary multiplied by the number of years they worked at the store.""We want Wal-Mart to admit that it went about closing the store in the wrong way,"" he said.The workers had 15 days from the date of the arbitration decision to file suit, a copy of the decision seen by Reuters said.

175,"  (Adds comment from Wal-Mart)By Randall Palmer and Allison MartellOTTAWA/TORONTO, June 27 Wal-Mart Stores Inc  violated Quebec's labor code when it closed a store in the province that had become one of the first in Canada to successfully unionize, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled on Friday.The ruling was a rebuke to the world's largest retailer, though its impact on unionization efforts at other Quebec and Canadian stores may be limited. The decision took issue with the timing of the 2005 closure, but it did not address the company's right to shut operations.The court sent the case to an arbitrator to determine appropriate remedies, which will likely include compensation for the 190 workers who lost their jobs when the store, in Jonquiere, Quebec, closed. The closure came shortly after the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) union was certified to represent the store's workers in 2004.Wal-Mart had said it did not close the store because it was being unionized, pointing to the fact that it had reached a collective agreement with the same union at a store in St-Hyacinthe, Quebec.""We are disappointed by the decision,"" Wal-Mart said in an emailed statement. ""This was an appeal of a unanimous decision by the Quebec Court of Appeal to reject the UFCW's claim, which in our view was a legally correct decision.""The company said it was reviewing the decision to determine its next steps. In 2009, the Supreme Court backed Wal-Mart's right to close the store, but Friday's win came after the union brought a fresh challenge under a different article in the Quebec Labor Code.Quebec, a largely French-speaking province, has traditionally been one of the most labor-friendly jurisdictions in North America.Friday's ruling found that Wal-Mart erred in closing the store during a ""freeze"" period, which starts when workers file to unionize and ends when they get a contract, go on strike or are locked out. Quebec law limits employers' ability to change working conditions during the freeze period.""Once a union has been certified, you have to negotiate,"" said Gilles LeVasseur, a professor and labor expert at the University of Ottawa. LeVasseur said the ruling does not prevent Wal-Mart from closing unionized stores outside of the freeze period. Financial penalties would not be material to the retail giant, he said, but public relations will be an issue.""A lot of people in Quebec will say, are they respecting our actual distinct-society way of seeing labor relations? We have a way of doing things in Quebec,"" he said.Wal-Mart is a formidable competitor in Quebec and the rest of Canada and has said it will invest about C$500 million ($467 million) this year to expand in the country. The United Food and Commercial Workers called the ruling a ""historic and positive milestone in protecting workers' rights.""But David Doorey, a labor law professor at York University in Toronto, said the decision does not fundamentally alter the dynamic between the retailer and its Canadian workers, given that the unionized workers still lost their jobs.""That message leaves a chill over all other Wal-Mart employees who would dare to exercise their legal rights to choose collective bargaining,"" he said.The Supreme Court decision was split 5-2.In the dissent, Judges Marshall Rothstein and Richard Wagner argued that applying the relevant law to a store closure would have ""absurd results"", blocking a closure during the freeze period but allowing it, for any reason, immediately after that period ends.The case is United Food and Commercial Workers, Local 503 v.

177,"  (Updates story first published on Tuesday with response from Accord inspection body)By Nandita BoseDHAKA, June 24 It took Western safety inspectors only about an hour to tour a factory the size of three football fields before ordering a partial shutdown of Sonia & Sweaters Ltd, a Bangladesh clothing supplier to Wal-Mart Stores Inc  and Debenhams.Two weeks later, the group that the inspectors represented changed its mind and allowed the factory to stay open, even though none of the repairs they suggested had been carried out.Such erratic decision-making poses a new set of problems for Bangladesh's $22 billion garments industry, whose safety record has been under the microscope since the collapse of a factory near Dhaka that killed more than 1,100 workers last year.More than a year after the public outcry that spurred Western retailers into demanding better standards from the factories that make their clothes, it also highlights the practical complexities of improving the conditions of millions of poor workers whilst also safeguarding their jobs.Export growth in the sector has slowed as buyers turn to India, Myanmar, Vietnam and Cambodia because of concerns over workshop safety, higher wages and political instability.Now factory owners say they are concerned about arbitrary shutdowns and meeting the cost of demands for remedial work, while workers worry about who will pay their wages if their workplace is temporarily closed.""We went through inexplicable harassment during this whole process, and I am sure they don't care about that,"" said Sonia & Sweaters Director Mahabubur Rahman, of his experience of the inspection.""But with their trigger-happy attitude, I am left wondering if they at least care about the workers, who they are meant to protect, because nobody has to explain to them what the implication of one factory shutdown is.""The garment industry accounts for 80 percent of Bangladesh's exports, and turmoil in the sector has put at risk the livelihoods of nearly 4 million garment workers, mostly women.FACTORY INSPECTIONS The collapse of the eight-storey Rana Plaza building in April 2013 brutally exposed the inadequacy of the safety regime in Bangladesh, where 5,600 garment factories are inspected by different local agencies that often lack sufficient technical equipment and the required expertise.The disaster led to the creation of the Accord on Fire and Building Safety, an inspection group led by European retailers, and the North American brands-led Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, which together are scrutinising around 2,100 factories.The groups, which have a mandate to recommend the closure of dangerous factories and demand repairs, are now embroiled in a debate over the inspection process and the question of who pays for upgrades and wages while factories stand idle.Making the situation worse, almost all global retail brands have opted to stay out of the arguments between inspection agencies and suppliers, according to industry officials.When the inspection groups were set up, retailers did not commit to pay for improvements they demanded - some Bangladesh factory owners are very wealthy and politically connected - but agreed to discuss assistance with wages and improvements if owners could not afford them. Wal-Mart spokesman Kevin Gardner said, as a founding member of the Alliance, the company's contributions have made funds available to help factory owners make necessary repairs and to support workers who may be temporarily displaced.This includes an initial worker safety fund of nearly $50 million and growing, and more than $100 million in access to low-cost capital funding to improve fire and structural safety. Debenhams declined to comment.SAFETY SHUTDOWNS Reuters obtained copies of two inspection reports on Sonia & Sweaters which showed the factory's civil engineer tried to warn Accord inspectors that their assessment that insufficient steel had been used in the building columns was inaccurate.The steel was later found to be adequate for operations to continue.Company managers told Reuters that documents on the building's load-bearing capacity sent to the inspectors after their assessment were overlooked. That oversight was only acknowledged after the factory's senior management physically carried the documents to the Accord's Dhaka office.The Accord assessed the number of steel bars in each column as 14-20, the lower range of which would be considered unsafe, whereas company officials said it was 32-35.""We advised them to close down the top floor immediately and go for a detailed engineering analysis,"" Brad Loewen, chief safety inspector of the Accord, said.Loewen said the owners returned and challenged the numbers with their own documents. The Accord stuck with its findings, but decided to consider the steel strength of each column was 20 bars, at the top of its range, rather than 14, which meant operations could continue, he said. Sonia & Sweaters had cleared a safety inspection by Wal-Mart in 2013, according to a report published by the U.S. retailer in November last year.The Western inspection groups, between them, have so far shut 14 factories and asked five factories to partially close, according to government data.Senior advisor to the Alliance Ian Spaulding said the group has been careful with the issue of factory shutdowns and has been working closely with the government on the issue. Five factories have been shut down as a result of their recommendations, he said.FOREIGN VS LOCAL The legal authority to shut factories rests with the Bangladesh government, and decisions to do so are reviewed by a government-appointed panel that includes one member each from the Accord and Alliance and two civil engineers from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET).That process has led to friction between local and foreign members.Four Wings Ltd operated a factory that supplied clothes to Swedish fashion retailer Hennes & Mauritz (H&M) until March, when it was closed down on the recommendation of Accord inspectors who feared the load-bearing capacity of the building was inadequate.The two BUET engineers on the review panel opposed an immediate closure, but were stopped from making recommendations and asked instead for an opinion with either a ""yes"" or a ""no"", according to a senior official at Four Wings and a professor from BUET who had direct knowledge of events. Both spoke on condition of anonymity. ""Everybody appreciates the fact that they are working hard to make this industry safe, but everybody they are working with will agree they are extremely arrogant and have a high-handed attitude,"" said the BUET professor.Ananta Garments Ltd's Mirpur factory, which employs 1,600 workers, was also shut down by the Accord on concerns over the buildings load-bearing capacity.""They found problems, they shut it down and we realised the repairs they have suggested will take eight months,"" said Inamul Haque Khan, managing director of Ananta Garments. ""Nobody had an answer to what happens to the workers, who pays their salaries.""He said he would pay workers' salaries for one more month before laying them off as he could not afford to pay more.Several garment factory owners said they were already absorbing most of a 79-percent increase in the minimum monthly wage to $68 that was imposed by the government last December, because global brands are baulking at paying higher prices.WHO PAYS? The Alliance has decided to share wage costs for two months and is currently holding discussions to extend it to four months. It is in the final stages of making available low-cost loans for repairs at five to seven factories, Spaulding said.The Accord requires factory owners to pay for repairs and  wages for six months. They are expected to discuss with their brands, who will ensure resources are available, Loewen said.But about a dozen garment factory owners Reuters spoke to said the Western brands they supplied had not got involved in talks over paying the bills. This was despite several rounds of discussions involving factory owners, government officials, unions and Accord and Alliance members.The Accord issued a statement on Thursday challenging the findings of Reuters and saying it would investigate further.H&M, the first signatory to the Accord, said it was actively participating in remediation processes involving its suppliers.Spokeswoman Andrea Roos said H&M discussed resource availability with all involved parties on a case-by-case basis. Two of H&M's supplier factories have undergone minor construction work as a result of inspections, she said.French retailer Auchan, which also sources garments in Bangladesh, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Softex Cotton, which supplies Auchan, was shut down by the Accord due to doubts over the factory's load-carrying capacity, but later allowed to resume partial operations, even though no repairs had been made.Softex is now suing the Accord, challenging its legal right to close factories and demanding $100 million in damages to business and reputation, according to a copy of a lawsuit filed in a Dhaka court seen by Reuters.Softex's factory was vandalised by workers after the sudden closure notice was issued and the company says it has been forced to take a loan to keep paying workers' salaries.""When there is a problem we are being notified, sometimes not even in a proper way, and then being left to our own devices, which is just not right,"" said Rezwan Selim, managing director of Softex Cotton.

188,"  (Corrects paragraph one of March 17 story to reflect Ma's apartment had more than one room)* Share of China online retail fell for first time in 2013* IPO in U.S. could exceed Facebook's $16 bln in value* Tencent, JD.com tie-up sharpens e-commerce challenge* Niche players, retail brands also step up competitionBy Adam JourdanSHANGHAI, March 17 Alibaba's dominance of online retail in China faces its biggest-ever challenge as the firm founded by Jack Ma in an apartment 15 years ago lines up a U.S. initial public offering that could value the firm at around $140 billion.In a rare blip, Alibaba Group Holdings lost market share last year while its nearest rivals all grew, according to Euromonitor. The market research firm sees China's internet retail market tripling from 2012 to over $300 billion in 2018 as the country's smartphone-savvy shoppers buy everything from plane tickets to sneakers online.China's biggest social media company, Tencent Holdings Ltd , is leading the revolt, linking the country's most popular messaging app, WeChat, with the number two e-commerce player, JD.com.An array of smaller rivals is also clawing away at Alibaba's lead, while household retail names like Nike Inc and Gap Inc are increasingly striking out away from the giant's Tmall electronic platform to set up more distinctive online stores of their own.""In China shopping is a social activity. You want to tell friends about it, recommend it - it's a smartphone activity, and whoever owns that organisational ability also has a hold over how a person shops,"" said Frank Lavin, Hong Kong-based chief executive of Export Now. Lavin's company helps global firms set up shop in China through Alibaba's Tmall.Alibaba's e-commerce prospects at home loom large after Ma's firm said on Sunday it was starting plans for a long-awaited listing in the U.S. - potentially the biggest-ever IPO by an Internet company - which could surpass the $16 billion raised by social media giant Facebook Inc in 2012.Alibaba still held a sturdy 45.1 percent of China's e-commerce market last year, down from 46.1 percent a year earlier, according to Euromonitor, and remains bullish in the face of Tencent, JD.com and others. It is beefing up its mobile services to keep up with China's legions of smartphone users.Alibaba did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this story, though the firm's executive vice chairman Joe Tsai was upbeat about the firm's e-commerce prospects in an interview with Reuters in Hong Kong last week. PEELING AWAY Alibaba is now battling rivals on multiple fronts. Alongside JD.com, heading for a $1.5 billion IPO of its own in the U.S., are well-funded vehicles like household appliance retailer Suning Commerce Group Co Ltd and Wal-Mart Stores Inc's grocery retailer Yihaodian.Smaller niche players like cosmetics specialist Vipshop Holdings Ltd are also growing in stature. And with global and local brands peeling away from Tmall, the trend is likely to see Alibaba's market share extend its fall, said Bryan Wang, Beijing-based vice president for Forrester Research.""We have definitely seen a lot more customers asking us in the last year about how to get away from Tmall,"" said Wang.Popular Internet clothing retailer HSTYLE has partly flown the nest. Competing with brands like H&M and Uniqlo, it has branched out from just having a Tmall outlet and now books half its sales through its own site and on JD.com and Tencent.""As a mature Internet brand we're looking to provide more individual service to our shoppers,"" Zhao Yingguang, founder and chairman of HSTYLE, told Reuters in an interview, describing his brand as one of the leading women's apparel retailers on Alibaba's platforms. ""We go and sell our products where the consumers are."" RIVALS RISING Alibaba's vast resources have helped it see off weaker players so far such as Otto Group, 139shop.com, Mecox Lane, Newegg.com and others, but the remaining contenders are more seasoned in competition with Alibaba - and ambitious.JD.com still lags some way behind Alibaba in second place with a 14 percent market share last year, up fractionally from a year earlier. But its IPO plans and the deal with Tencent - a less well-known name outside China than Alibaba, but worth almost $150 billion by market value - will give it new financial and operational resources.Tencent, meanwhile, hopes its JD.com tie-up will help it to extend its presence in ""the fast-growing physical goods e-commerce market"", Tencent president Martin Lau said in a statement. The deal also arms JD.com with the 225 million monthly active users of the WeChat messaging service in China.As well as technology leading change, consumers themselves are developing new habits, becoming more picky and looking to get more for their money.""I am leaning toward specialist stores now, because the service is often better than the giant retailers and the delivery I always find is faster,"" said Grace Lin, 20, a student in Shanghai. ""It's not necessarily that I use Tmall less now, but I do use other stores more."" Lin often shops on cosmetics specialist Vipshop's online site. The firm saw revenue climb 145 percent in 2013, while customer numbers shot up 130 percent over the same period, according to an earnings conference call this month. Vipshop almost doubled its market share to 1.8 percent last year.Suning, a traditional electronics retailer with a strong bricks and mortar presence, is bulking up its online presence, as is rival Bain Capital-backed Gome Electrical Appliances Holding Ltd. Both raised their market share last year.Yihaodian leverages majority owner Wal-Mart's global name and product range, while other niche players such as Jumei and Yesmywine.com corner specific markets in cosmetics and alcohol.MA VS MA Alibaba's Jack Ma has locked horns repeatedly of late with his rival at Tencent, co-founder Pony Ma - a namesake but unrelated. Rhetoric from the two internet giants has grown increasingly barbed as competition has raged from gaming and microblogs, to taxi hire app price wars and online payment systems that are now the subject of close scrutiny by China's central bank.When Tencent launched a ""red envelope"" feature for WeChat, which let users send money gifts by smartphone over the Chinese New Year, Jack Ma wrote it was a ""Pearl Harbour attack"" on his company's Alipay payment system, referring to the unexpected bombing of the American port during World War II. Tencent said over 8 million people used the WeChat feature.Alibaba-invested Weibo Corp, a popular Twitter-like social media platform, filed for a $500 million U.S. IPO of its own on Friday, as it looks to defend its position against fierce competition from Tencent's WeChat.WeChat does indeed present a threat to Alibaba. In a research report in December, Standard Chartered said its payment function, known in Chinese as Weixin, paired with its wide popularity, could be a ""killer weapon"" for Tencent to take market share in mobile e-commerce.China has some of the most active mobile web users in the world. The country's mobile Internet users hit 500 million in 2013, and is estimated to hit 750 million by 2017, according to data from China-based consultancy iResearch.""The wind is blowing against Alibaba and the biggest risk is coming from the mobile sector,"" said Zhang Chenhao, executive director at e-commmerce-focused investment advisory firm Gold Sand Capital.""Firms are all lining up - the school of Tencent or the school of Alibaba - and the camps are forming,"" said Zhang.($1=6.14 Yuan)   (Reporting by Adam Jourdan in SHANGHAI; Additional reporting by Jane Lee in JINAN, Paul Carsten in HONG KONG and SHANGHAI newsroom; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell)",2014-07-14,WMT,"Mon Jul 14, 2014 | 12:59am EDT","CORRECTED-RPT-As giant U.S. IPO nears, Alibaba's China e-commerce crown slips",http://www.reuters.com//article/china-ecommerce-graphicspixtvrepeatcorre-idUSL3N0ME17U20140714?type=companyNews
189,"   By Lewis Krauskopf | July 18  July 18 The success of General Electric Co's  impending initial public offering for its private-label credit card unit could ride on investors' willingness to bet that a lukewarm consumer-led U.S. economic recovery heats up.GE began its investor road show on Friday for the IPO of the unit, to be called Synchrony Financial, as it revealed new details about the business.Set for the end of the month, the IPO of 15 percent of Synchrony is expected to raise around $3.1 billion, surpassing Ally Financial Inc as the biggest U.S. financial services stock flotation this year.While the IPO could enjoy a positive initial reception given the strong demand for offerings this year and investors' eagerness to deploy cash in the market, its longer-term performance will likely be hitched to the strength of the belief in a consumer recovery.""It's a good indicator and good investment based on people who believe the economy is going to continue to improve as it relates to the consumer,"" said David Menlow, president of IPOfinancial.com, an IPO and secondary offering research firm.More than two-thirds of Synchrony's $9.4 billion in revenue last year came from its retail card business, which offers private label credit cards carrying brands of corporate partners such as Amazon.com Inc, JC Penney Co, Lowe's Companies Inc and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Some of those retailers including JC Penney and Wal-Mart have struggled to find sales growth this year even as the broader economy has recovered, in part because a broad swath of consumers remains constrained by debt and worried about job prospects.Still, they could eventually benefit from a strengthening recovery. A gauge of U.S. consumer spending rose solidly in June, the U.S. Commerce Department reported earlier this week, indicating the economy ended the second quarter on stronger footing.Synchrony's rivals in the private label card business include consumer banks such as Citigroup Inc and Wells Fargo. Synchrony's other revenue comes from financing for bigger ticket consumer purchases, such as electronics or jewelry, and for healthcare procedures.""My sense is this is fertile ground for a new offering,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer for BMO Private Bank in Chicago. ""Holders of this paper, they have to believe in the long-term health of the economy and the consumer.""IPOs have performed well initially this year, with stocks rising 22 percent on average between the final offering price and the first day's close, said Josef Schuster, founder of IPOX Schuster LLC, which helps create index funds for IPOs. ""Risk appetite is quite high because the market is obviously very strong,"" Schuster said.GE, which revealed details for Synchrony on Friday as it posted a 13 percent rise in second-quarter profit, valued the rest of Synchrony at around $17 billion. GE plans to offer the rest of the business to its shareholders through an exchange late next year.""It is the most shareholder-friendly execution,"" GE Chief Financial Officer Jeff Bornstein said in an interview. ""It's much more tax-efficient than selling the company outright for cash.""The separation is critical to GE's plan to slim down its GE Capital finance business and boost its industrial operations to 75 percent of company earnings by 2016, up from 55 percent last year.""For GE, it's more about de-risking the company and focusing on the areas in industrial where they want to focus their growth,"" said Jim Corridore, an equity analyst with S&P Capital IQ.

192,"   By Olivia Oran and Soyoung Kim | NEW YORK  NEW YORK PetSmart Inc has hired investment bank JPMorgan Chase & Co to evaluate a range of alternatives, including a leveraged share buyback and a potential deal with private equity, according to people familiar with the matter.PetSmart's hiring of JPMorgan in recent weeks comes as investor pressure mounts on the pet supply store chain to sell itself, at a time when fierce competition from large retailers including Wal-Mart and Amazon squeezes specialty stores.Activist investment firm Jana Partners LLC, as well as Longview Asset Management, which together own a stake of close to 20 percent in PetSmart, have urged the nearly $7 billion company to pursue a sale.Buyout firms have long been interested in the prospect of taking PetSmart private and the latest pressure from large shareholders have prompted several to explore a leveraged buyout, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be named because the matter is not private. PetSmart's evaluation of strategic alternatives is in the very early stages, and the company is currently more inclined to pursue a leveraged buyback - taking on debt to conduct a big share repurchase program, than other deal options, the people said.PetSmart is expected by analysts to generate $930 million of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization this year, and its nearly debt-free balance sheet also can withstand some borrowing.Representatives for PetSmart and JPMorgan declined to comment. Jana, run by Barry Rosenstein, often pressures companies it invests in to change strategies or sell themselves. It disclosed a stake in grocery chain Safeway Inc in September and asked it to explore strategic alternatives.Safeway eventually agreed to be acquired by private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management in a deal valued at about $9.4 billion in March. In response to shareholder pressure, PetSmart said on July 7 that it is reviewing potential changes in its capital structure, with a focus on returning capital to shareholders.The Phoenix, Arizona-based retailer, founded in 1986, has about 53,000 employees, operates more than 1,340 pet stores, as well as 200 in-store dog and cat boarding facilities, according to its website.

193,"   By Tom Hals  The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed on Wednesday a lower court ruling that ordered Wal-Mart Stores Inc to provide a shareholder with documents related to the company's internal probe of allegations the retailer had paid bribes in Mexico.Wal-Mart had appealed a ruling by Delaware's lower Court of Chancery that ordered the company to produce documents to an Indiana union pension trust, which owns the company's stock. The trust had sued Wal-Mart for access to the documents, saying it needed them to determine if the company's board breached duties to shareholders by failing to investigate bribery allegations.Wal-Mart did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The alleged bribes and cover-up first came to light with a New York Times story in 2012 which reported that the company's Mexican unit had been making illicit payments since 2005 to obtain permits needed to open new stores.    The story said Wal-Mart's investigators found evidence of widespread payments and suspected that laws had been broken. The story also said Wal-Mart leaders rejected an investigator's recommendation to expand the investigation and instead covered it up.    Wal-Mart is under investigation by U.S. and Mexican authorities who are trying to determine if crimes were committed. To determine if Wal-Mart's board properly investigated, the Indiana Electrical Workers Pension Trust Fund IBEW exercised its right as a stockholder in 2012 to demand the company provide certain documents. Eventually a dispute over information requested led the trust to sue in Delaware, where Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart is incorporated.    Wal-Mart objected to a ruling by then-Chancellor Leo Strine in 2013 ordering the retailer to provide seven years of documents, including some never reviewed by the board. The retailer appealed his order to provide documents that Wal-Mart said were protected by the attorney-client privilege.The Delaware Supreme Court's unanimous ruling rejected Wal-Mart's arguments and said in a 39-page ruling that certain lower-ranking officials had a ""reporting relationship"" to members of the board, making their communications relevant. The high court also found the seven-year period of documents was appropriate because Wal-Mart did not initially object to it.In addition, the Supreme Court held that the attorney-client privilege could not protect information if the documents are essential to proving a breach of fiduciary duties. Books-and-records requests like the one by the pension trust often lead to a shareholder filing what is known as a derivative lawsuit. In such cases, a shareholder sues the board on behalf of the corporation to recover damages caused by directors acting in their own interests. Successful derivative cases often result in corporate governance changes rather than monetary damages that are more common in successful securities class actions.The Supreme Court ruling also barred the pension fund trust from using documents that were obtained from an anonymous source, unless the documents had been be made public elsewhere.

Foran, 53, joins Wal-Mart's U.S. business at a time the company is struggling to retain its traditional low-income customers. The U.S. business accounts for about 60 percent of the company's total revenue.In the first quarter, Wal-Mart posted its weakest sales growth in five years and its full-year profit forecast disappointed investors.Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said Wal-Mart Chief Executive Doug McMillon wanted new blood to lead the U.S. business and Simon was unhappy after missing out on the top job last year.""Walmart U.S. has not been knocking the cover off the ball,"" Yarbrough said. ""They have lagged. So it looks like Doug was looking at a fresh perspective and Simon wanted to leave."" Wal-Mart's shares fell 1 percent to $76.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.Foran, a New Zealander, joined Wal-Mart from Australian retailer Woolworths Ltd, where he headed the supermarket business.He had been widely tipped to head Woolworths, but quit after he lost out on the top job. (reut.rs/WFzyPc)Foran held several senior roles at Woolworths, including general manager of the discount department store division Big W and consumer electronics retailer Dick Smith. Foran joined Wal-Mart in 2011 and became the chief executive of Walmart China within six months. He starts his new job on Aug. 9.His experience includes merchandising and marketing - skills Wal-Mart hopes can ease criticism that its stores run out of regular items.In a Consumer Reports survey in March, Wal-Mart received the lowest rating among supermarkets, with shoppers also complaining about confusing pricing and store layouts.""Greg Foran is well respected and brings with him a strong background in both grocery and general merchandise,"" said Sandra Skrovan from retail analytics firm Planet Retail.Foran will be paid an annual salary of around $950,000, Wal-Mart said in a filing. He is also in line for stock options of up to $4.9 million early next year.Simon will receive a severance package of about $4.5 million, payable through 2016. The deal with Simon prohibits him from working at a rival or poaching Wal-Mart's employees for two years.Wal-Mart's stock has fallen 1.6 percent in the year to Wednesday's close, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has risen around 10 percent.

202,"  SHANGHAI Microsoft Corp will launch its Xbox One gaming console in China on September 23, making it the first foreign company to start selling consoles in the world's third-biggest gaming market after a ban on the devices was lifted this year.Yusuf Mehdi, head of marketing and strategy for Microsoft's Xbox group, announced the launch date at an event in Shanghai. The console will cost 3,699 yuan ($600) without the Kinect motion detection system and 4,299 yuan ($700) with Kinect.In the United States, the Xbox One with Kinect costs $499 and without it is $399, a difference of more than $200 compared with the respective prices in China.In September last year, Microsoft reached a deal with Chinese internet TV set-top box maker BesTV New Media Co Ltd to form a joint venture to manufacture the consoles in Shanghai's Free Trade Zone.Zhang Dazhong, a senior vice president at Shanghai Media Group, the parent of BesTV New Media, said at the event the Xbox launch had been approved by the government. Microsoft is forging ahead with the launch despite Tuesday's government announcement that the U.S. software giant is the subject of an anti-monopoly investigation.China is the world's third-biggest gaming market, where revenues grew by more than a third from 2012 to nearly $14 billion last year, but piracy and the dominance of PC and mobile gaming may leave little room for legitimate console and game sales. This year, the government lifted a 2000 ban on gaming consoles.In May, Sony Corp said it would set up a joint-venture with Shanghai Oriental Pearl Group to bring the PlayStation games console to China.

Energizer said on Wednesday it expects sales in the household products business to stabilize in the fourth quarter as it raises spending on advertising and marketing.Sales of Energizer's household products have been falling for a year after Wal-Mart Stores Inc's warehouse unit Sam's Club and discount store chain Family Dollar Stores Inc  ended contracts with the company.Energizer does not make batteries for devices such as tablets and smartphones, which has hurt its sales as demand for rechargeable batteries bundled with mobile devices rises.The business's contribution to total revenue slid to $411.7 million, or 36 percent of overall sales, in the third quarter, compared to about 45 percent last year. The company said on Wednesday it would spin off the business, which also sells portable lights, in a tax-free transaction to shareholders.Energizer also maintained its full-year adjusted net income forecast of $7-$7.25 per share.Analysts on average were expecting $7.08 per share. Net income for the third quarter fell to $64.5 million, or $1.03 per share, from $87.2 million, or $1.38 per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, Energizer earned $1.46 per share, missing the average analyst estimate of $1.55, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Increased advertising and promotional spending and a higher tax rate hurt earnings.Revenue rose 1.7 percent to $1.13 billion, beating the average estimate of $1.12 billion.Sales from its personal care business were helped by strong demand for women's razors and sunscreen products. It expects personal care sales to be flat in the fourth quarter.Energizer's shares were up 3 percent at $118.54 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.

204,"  * Target appoints Pepsi executive Brian Cornell as CEO   (Adds analysts' comments, updates shares)By Siddharth CavaleJuly 31 Beleaguered retailer Target Corp  named former PepsiCo and Wal-Mart executive Brian Cornell as CEO and chairman as it tries to regain customer confidence following a devastating data breach last year that hit earnings.Cornell, the first outsider to lead Target, has his work cut out. The company's comparable store sales have declined in three of the last five quarters, while store visits have fallen for six straight quarters.An ambitious expansion into Canada last year has stumbled. The company opened a record 124 stores, but couldn't keep shelves full due to delivery bottlenecks and customers complained of steep prices.The No.3 U.S. retailer has also been late to embrace e-commerce, lagging Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Amazon.com .From 2009 to 2012, Cornell led a turn-around at Sam's Club, Wal-Mart's slowest growing business at the time. In May 2012, he joined PepsiCo Inc to head the company's largest business, Americas Foods unit, which makes Frito Lay chips and Quaker oats.""He did a very solid job at Sam's,"" Cowen & Co analyst Faye Landes said, citing that same-store sales growth at the membership-only stores jumped to 5.1 percent from 1.4 percent during Cornell's tenure.The 55-year-old, who takes the top post at Target on Aug. 12, had been a contender to succeed PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi, according to the Wall Street Journal, which reported Cornell's appointment earlier on Thursday. (on.wsj.com/1xCMUqk)Before joining Sam's Club, Cornell held the top job at arts and crafts chain Michael's Stores Inc for two years. ""... His experience at large retail and consumer product goods organizations should be instrumental in guiding Target,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Simeon Gutman wrote in a note.Under previous CEO Gregg Steinhafel, Target focused on low-margin grocery items to entice frugal customers, turning away from its popular home and apparel products, which gave the company its cheap chic appeal.""I think the bottom line now is to renew merchandise with fresh styles,"" Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said. Refocusing on home and apparel will expand margins and widen its customer base, helping Target avoid a price war with Wal-Mart, Yarbrough said.Wal-Mart gets about 60 percent of its total U.S. revenue from selling groceries.Steinhafel was removed in May, after Target lost nearly $1 billion in Canada in 2013 and the data breach in the key holiday season led to the theft of at least 40 million payment card numbers and 70 million other data.CFO John Mulligan has led Target in the interim and will now return full-time to his CFO duties after Cornell's appointment.The company's shares were down 2 percent at $60.20 in afternoon trading.The stock fell 11 percent in the weeks following the breach, but has made up for most of those losses since then to close at $61.38 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.

213,"   By Siddharth Cavale and Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Weak results from the likes of Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Macy's Inc (M.N) are the latest sign less affluent U.S. consumers are still pinching their pennies and the trend appears to be hurting upmarket retailers as well.A number of large U.S. retailers who cater to low and middle income consumers reported disappointing quarterly comparable sales this week, pointing to a cutback in spending and a shift in preferences to stores nearer to home.""Consumers are still concerned about cost of living and employment...overall we are seeing no changes in the consumer than what we have seen in the last few quarters,"" Wal-Mart Chief Financial Officer Charles Holley said on Thursday.Wal-Mart cut its profit forecast for the year, citing higher healthcare and online investment costs, but also cautioned that  heavy discounting would continue into the holiday season to draw in its shoppers, many of whom depend on government assistance. Even department store operator Macy's, which caters to a more affluent clientele, lowered its same-store sales forecast for the year. The weak sales and margin data illustrate the effects of a slowly improving job market, volatile fuel prices and government food stamp cuts, Joseph Agnese, equity analyst at S&P Capital IQ told Reuters.""Even though the job market has picked up, income growth is very weak. We are adding jobs but average earnings aren’t growing very rapidly,"" Robert Brusca, chief economist at consulting firm Fact and Opinion Economics, said in a phone interview.Amid the general gloom, one surprising glimmer of hope came from struggling department store chain J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N), which reported a 5 percent rise in quarterly sales and a narrower loss.   SPENDING RESTRAINT Even McDonald's Corp (MCD.N), which sells burgers and fries for as little as a dollar, has struggled to grow sales at established restaurants in the United States since November 2013. Same-restaurant sales at home fell 3.2 percent in July. The Labor Department's monthly employment report showed more than 200,000 jobs created for the sixth straight month in July.But, Brusca said, a lot of the jobs are being added in low-income brackets.Spending would be much greater if wages increased for the people already employed, he said. American workers, on average, earned $24.45 an hour in July, up only a penny from June, the Labor Department's data showed.Over the last year, wages have grown just 2 percent, in keeping with where they have been stuck since late 2009. Before then, hourly earnings typically rose 3 percent or 4 percent a year.""Consumer sentiment is the highest since 2007, but consumer optimism isn't translating into spending,"" Guy LeBas, analyst at Janney Capital Markets told Reuters.The restraint is hurting retailers in the ""affordable luxury"" space such as Michael Kors Holdings Ltd (KORS.N) and Kate Spade & Co's (KATE.N), which have had to fall back on discounts to push their handbags and other accessories. Kate Spade shares lost nearly a quarter of their value on Tuesday after the retailer said gross margins were being hit by intense competition, particularly in its low-end Kate Spade Saturday brand. Michael Kors's quarterly margins were squeezed by increased discounting to clear inventory and watchmaker Fossil Inc (FOSL.O) announced lower profits as declining mall traffic, a problem for many retailers, took its toll.The rise of e-commerce has played a role in the weakness of brick and mortar retailers as well, although Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) is struggling to reap a bottom-line boost from its surging sales. Price cuts have now become a necessity for many retailers as well, to be able ""to compete with the aggressive department store promotions"" and get customers ""to purchase in an otherwise stagnant fashion environment,"" Wedbush analysts wrote in a note.In addition to McDonald's, the U.S. consumer's reluctance to spend has also hit some of the country's more upscale ""fast-casual"" eateries, where many chains have been feeling the squeeze even as Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N) has prospered.Noodles & Co (NDLS.O), a full-service restaurant chain, on Wednesday slashed full-year sales forecasts, in part for a drop in frugal customers visiting its restaurants. Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc's (RRGB.O), also a fast-casual chain, fell 18 percent on Thursday, reported lower-than-expected quarterly sales and profit citing intense and ""non-sustainable discounting"" from rivals.

214,"  (Adds CEO comment, gross margin forecast)Aug 14 Department store chain J.C. Penney  reported stronger- than-expected quarterly same-store sales, bucking a trend of disappointing sales from peers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Macy's Inc.J.C. Penney's shares were up 3.2 percent in extended trading after the company also reported a much smaller second-quarter loss that underscored a firm turnaround in its business.Same-store sales rose 6 percent on strong demand for home goods and jewelry, topping the 5.8 percent growth analysts had forecast.This was Penney's third straight quarter of comparable sales growth after nearly two years of declines when the struggling retailer ditched popular merchandise and promotional offers in an effort to move upmarket.The botched move, led by former Chief Executive Ron Johnson, resulted in steep declines in sales in 2012.Penney fired Johnson in early 2013 and has since revamped its household goods section and brought back many of its in-house brands such as Cooks and St. John's Bay. The company was also able to boost its gross margins to 36 percent from 29.6 percent at a time when heavy discounting weighed on Wal-Mart and Macy's.Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, reported flat same-store sales in the United States on Thursday, while department store Macy's cut its full-year same-store sales forecast.""In the second quarter, we gained additional market share while significantly increasing gross margin in a highly competitive promotional environment,"" Chief Executive Myron Ullman said in a statement. The company said Ullman, who underwent a surgery related to a medical condition he had for more than 20 years, is recovering and is expected to return to work soon.Strong sales in the final weeks of the quarter - the beginning of the back-to-school season - also helped increase revenue, the company said in its post-earnings conference call.Penney said it expects current quarter same-store sales to increase in the mid-single digits percentage range. Sales in the company's online business, which is also being revamped, increased 16.7 percent in the quarter.The company's loss narrowed to $172 million, or 56 cents per share, in the second quarter ended August 2, from $586 million, or $2.66 per share a year earlier.Sales rose to $2.79 billion from $2.66 billion.Excluding items, the company reported a loss of 75 cents per share.Analysts on average had expected a loss of 93 cents per share on revenue of $2.79 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Shares of the company jumped as much as 13 percent in after-market trading but lost some of those gains trade up 3.2 percent at $10.05.

215,"   By Akane Otani | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. stocks advanced on Thursday after conciliatory comments from Russia helped ease concerns about escalation of the conflict in Ukraine and offset some uninspiring earnings.Gains were broad, with all but one of the S&P’s 10 primary sector indexes rising for the day. An S&P index of healthcare stocks .SPXHC gained 1.2 percent and led the advance, while an index of energy stocks .SPNY dragged, slipping 0.5 percent.Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia would stand up for itself but not at the cost of confrontation with the outside world, striking a softer tone after tough rhetoric aimed at Ukraine for several months. The market had been pressured in recent weeks by uncertainty over the conflict.Earnings season continued to wind down, with 92 percent of S&P 500 companies having reported quarterly earnings by Thursday morning. Of the companies that have reported results so far, 67.7 percent beat analysts' expectations.      Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), the nation's largest retailer, reported earnings and revenue that met expectations. But the company cut its forecast for coming quarters. The Dow component's stock rose 0.5 percent to $74.39. Shares of Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O), another Dow component, fell 2.6 percent to $24.54. The network equipment maker gave a tepid outlook for its current quarter and announced massive job cuts despite reporting revenue that beat expectations. The stock market has looked past flaring tensions abroad to rally for an extended period, with the S&P 500 marking more than 1,000 days since its last correction, which Wall Street defines as a drop of 10 percent from the most recent high. “In October, the Fed is going to get away from money printing, and since we haven’t had a correction in a long time, it could undermine things very quickly once people realize growth isn’t in line with their expectations,” said Jeff Duncan, president of Duncan Financial Management in Sunset Hills, Missouri.The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 61.78 points, or 0.37 percent, to close at 16,713.58. The S&P 500 .SPX gained 8.46 points, or 0.43 percent, to finish at 1,955.18. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 18.88 points, or 0.43 percent, to end at 4,453.00. Shares of Boeing Co (BA.N) shot up 1.7 percent to $124.11, making it the Dow's second-biggest gainer. The company said demand for its commercial jetliners was very strong and signaled it is getting close to deciding whether to further accelerate output. The price of Berkshire Hathaway Inc's (BRKa.N) Class A stock crossed $200,000 for the first time on Thursday in the latest milestone for the company that Warren Buffett built over nearly five decades. Berkshire Hathaway closed at $202,850, up 1.8 percent on the New York Stock Exchange.After the bell, shares of Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) slid 1.7 percent. The upscale department store chain, known for its selection of fashion labels and customer service, reported second-quarter earnings in line with expectations and a 3 percent increase in same-store sales. JC Penney Co Inc (JCP.N) shares initially rose 7 percent to $10.40 in extended-hours trading before falling to unchanged from the NYSE close at $9.74. After the bell, the department store chain reported quarterly sales rose 5 percent while its quarterly loss narrowed to 56 cents per share.Shares of Monster Beverage Corp (MNST.O) soared 30 percent to $71.65 in extended-hours trading on news that the energy drink maker entered a long term partnership with Coca-Cola Co (KO.N). During the regular session, Red Robin Gourmet Burgers (RRGB.O) had its worst trading day since November 2006. The burger chain reported quarterly earnings and revenue sharply below expectations, sending its stock tumbling 18.5 percent to $52.63.About 4.7 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, compared with the five-day average of 5.4 billion.

216,"  Wal-Mart Stores Inc cut its full-year profit forecast, citing higher employee healthcare costs and increased investment in its online business.The world's largest retailer, which has 1.4 million employees in the United States, raised its estimate for U.S. healthcare costs this year to $500 million from $330 million. U.S. healthcare costs rose in the second quarter due to increased enrollments and medical cost inflation, Wal-Mart said.As expected, the retailer also reported flat U.S. same-store sales, excluding fuel, for the second quarter - the sixth quarter of declining or no growth.Chief Executive Doug McMillon blamed intense competition and  weak consumer spending for sluggish U.S. same-store sales.U.S. retail sales in July were the weakest since January, data showed on Wednesday.Department store operator Kohl's Corp, which also reported results on Thursday, said its quarterly same-store sales fell 1.3 percent. Wal-Mart is playing catch-up in online retailing, which is dominated by Amazon.com Inc, as shoppers increasingly turn to the Web to buy everyday items. Wal-Mart named a new head for its online business in June, as part of its aggressive plans to integrate the business with its network of brick-and-mortar stores. The company's revenue rose by a better-than-expected 2.8 percent in the second quarter, helped by higher sales at its smaller-format stores. ""We're encouraged by the performance of our small-format stores and e-commerce, areas where we're investing significantly this year. But we wanted to see stronger comps overall in Walmart U.S..."" McMillon said in a statement.The company cut its forecast for earnings from continuing operations for the year ending Jan. 31 to $4.90-$5.15 per share from $5.10-$5.45. Wal-Mart shares were little changed at $73.90 before the bell on Thursday.  Net income attributable to the company rose to $4.09 billion, or $1.26 per share, in the quarter ended July 31 from $4.07 billion, or $1.24 per share, a year earlier.Wal-Mart reported earnings of $1.21 per share from continuing operations attributable to the company, matching the average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Total revenue rose to $120.13 billion from $116.83 billion, a year earlier.Up to Wednesday's close, Wal-Mart shares had fallen about 6 percent this year.

The company said it is investing more to ensure its service business turns profitable ""early next year.""Plug Power also said it expects ""a plethora of global opportunities"" from the auto-manufacturing market as its customers begin to use hydrogen fuel cells at manufacturing sites worldwide.Plug Power customers such as Daimler AG and BMW AG use fuel cells to power forklifts and other material handling devices at their warehouses.

Hydrogenics and Ballard Power also reported smaller quarterly losses, helped by rising demand for fuel cells used in forklifts, telecom networks and power backup systems.Plug Power's second-quarter revenue rose 131 percent to $17.32 million.

220,"   By James B. Kelleher  Wal-Mart Stores Inc, which has pledged to buy an additional $250 billion in U.S.-made goods over the next decade, is hitting a snag as it tries to meet that promise: Some vendors keen to participate in the initiative complain that after decades of offshoring it has become impossible to domestically source even commonplace components for their products. So America's largest retailer has invited dozens of small- and midsize manufacturers that aren't necessarily interested in having a direct relationship with Walmart to come to Denver this week for a two-day matchmaking event.The goal? To connect Walmart vendors hungry for key parts with manufacturers that have idle plants - and to put those plants back to work cranking out components, like small electric motors or polyester yarn, that have become hard to find.“We're going to try to match up (vendors) who are looking for component parts with factories that have capacity in the hopes that we can rebuild that supply chain that doesn’t exist anymore,"" said Michelle Gloeckler, the Walmart senior vice president in charge of the initiative.Critics of the retailing giant are quick to claim that Walmart, which built its empire on low prices, is partially to blame for the sorry state of U.S. manufacturing.Mary Bottari, a former trade analyst for Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch, says Walmart’s push for cheap goods ""has fueled a global race to the bottom in wages and working conditions."" And the Economic Policy Institute, a union-friendly think tank, estimates Walmart's trade with China alone has cost the United States 200,000 jobs. Walmart disputes those claims, and spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan says Boston Consulting Group has estimated that the domestic-sourcing initiative will create 1 million jobs in manufacturing and related service jobs.ZIPPERS AND SNAPS  The ""Made in USA"" program was conceived as a way to help Walmart win back customers who have defected in recent years to even cheaper competitors such as Dollar Tree and Dollar General. So far the effort has failed to stem a five-quarter-long decline in U.S. sales.Walmart says the 18-month-old program is a winner with customers. It hopes the Denver event, which has attracted 100 component part manufacturers as well hundreds of existing and wannabe Walmart vendors, will allow it to rapidly increase the number of U.S.-made products available in its more than 4,200 U.S. stores.But the event is also a tacit acknowledgment that the “Made in USA"" pledge is harder than it might have seemed when it was announced last year.Not only are some raw materials and components hard to find, but many of the companies tempted to participate in the domestic-sourcing program are unprepared to do business with Walmart and its storied - but complex - inventory control and logistics system.  Walmart's suppliers say difficulties with the program do not invalidate the idea. A number of factors, including rising wages in China, plummeting productivity-adjusted wages at home and a new appreciation for short, responsive supply chains, mean they can compete with Chinese rivals. ""By eliminating the ocean freight, what we've done is lower the overall cost of goods. So I can not only beat Chinese prices, I can obliterate them,"" says Keith Scheffler, president of Creative Things, an Arkansas toymaker that recently shuttered its last Chinese plant.

223,"   By Lucia Mutikani | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. manufacturing output rose broadly in July and automobile production recorded its largest increase in five years, boosting the economy at the start of the third quarter.While other data on Friday showed some cooling in factory activity in New York state this month, economists said it did not change the view of an economy with strong momentum, noting that the pullback followed a robust increase in July.""The broad-based nature of the (manufacturing) gains indicates that the strong second-quarter rebound in economic growth momentum is being sustained,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.The Federal Reserve said factory production jumped 1.0 percent last month after rising 0.3 percent in June. That was the largest gain since February and reflected increases across all major categories.Auto production surged 10.1 percent, the biggest rise since July 2009. There were also sturdy gains in the production of  machinery and computers and electronic goods, which economists said hinted at a pick-up in business investment this quarter.A stronger pace of business investment is needed to ensure sustained economic growth.The economy grew at a 4.0 percent annual pace in the second quarter and current forecasts peg the growth rate for the third quarter within a range of 2.5 percent to 3.0 percent.Industrial capacity utilization, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, last month hit its highest level since February 2008. The solid rise in manufacturing and a 0.3 percent advance in mining output helped to offset a 3.4 percent weather-driven decline in utilities production. That left overall industrial production up 0.4 percent in July.The data had little impact on U.S. financial markets, with traders focusing instead on events in Ukraine. The Ukrainian government said its forces had attacked and partly destroyed a Russian armored column that entered Ukrainian territory overnight.BENIGN PRODUCER INFLATION  In a separate report, the New York Fed said its ""Empire State"" general business conditions index fell to 14.69 this month from 25.60 in July. A reading above zero indicates expansion. Growth in new orders slowed, but a further decline in inventories pointed to an acceleration in activity in the months ahead.While manufacturing is gaining steam, there is little sign of a broad pick-up in inflation pressures at the factory gate.In another report, the Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand edged up 0.1 percent in July as the cost of energy products fell, offsetting an increase in food prices. Prices received by the nation's farms, factories and refineries rose 0.4 percent in June. In the 12 months through July, producer prices increased 1.7 percent.Excluding food and energy, wholesale prices gained 0.2 percent, matching June's increase. They were up 1.6 percent in the 12 months through July.""Aside from recent energy weakness, the PPI results continued to point to a steady firming in underlying inflation trends that we expect to continue to be seen in a continued inflection higher in the core consumer price index as well,"" said Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley in New York.  Overall, inflation has been rising in recent months, a fact acknowledged by the Fed at its July policy meeting. The U.S. central bank, which had repeatedly warned that price pressures were too low, said the likelihood of inflation running persistently below its 2 percent target had diminished somewhat.Firming inflation and a tightening labor market have led some economists to anticipate an early interest rate increase from the Fed. The central bank, however, has shown no sign of being in a hurry to lift its benchmark lending rate from near zero, where it has been since December 2008.Another report on Friday showed consumer sentiment hit a nine-month low in early August. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell to 79.2 from 81.8 in July.

228,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan and Devika  Krishna Kumar  Dollar General Corp offered to buy Family Dollar Stores Inc for $8.95 billion, trumping a bid by Dollar Tree Inc and aiming to strengthen its dominance of a growing segment of retailers serving penny-pinching customers.Shares of Family Dollar, the No. 2 U.S. discount chain, rose as much as 5.2 percent to $80.00 in regular trading, above the offer price of $78.50 per share in cash, suggesting that investors anticipate a bidding war.""Both Dollar General and Dollar Tree have some capacity to go a little bit higher with the offer price,"" said Joseph Feldman, analyst at Telsey Advisory Group.Dollar stores have been a popular choice for low- and middle-income U.S. consumers in a weak economy. At the same time, Wal-Mart Stores Inc and other large retailers which serve a similar customer base have been struggling with weak sales amid a cutback in spending and a shift in preferences to stores nearer to home.The U.S. market for dollar stores grew 45.7 percent to $48.2 billion between 2008 and 2013 and is expected to grow 18 percent in the next five years, according to Euromonitor International.But the growth has recently started slowing due to intense competition, Kahn said.""We have a tremendous amount of strength in the rural communities and we have things to learn in the metro,"" Dollar General Chief Executive Rick Dreiling said on a conference call. ""Family Dollar is just the reverse.""The combined company would have nearly 20,000 stores across 46 U.S. states and annual sales in excess of $28 billion.It would also allow Dollar General to retain its No. 1 spot among U.S. dollar stores. Dollar Tree's $8.5 billion bid for Family Dollar, announced on July 28, would have vaulted that merged company ahead of Dollar General.Combined, the three dollar chains' annual sales total about $35 billion - less than a tenth of Wal-Mart's $473 billion.Dreiling, who will postpone a retirement planned for next year to stay on as CEO of the combined company through May 2016, said Dollar General had faced stiffer competition from new Family Dollar stores than from Wal-Mart.Both Dollar General and Family Dollar offer goods at multiple price points, while Dollar Tree sticks rigidly to a $1 or less format. This - along with the location of Dollar General and Family Dollar stores - would make Dollar General a more likely buyer, analysts said. Family Dollar's presence is biggest in Texas and the eastern United States. Texas is also home to more Dollar General stores than any other state - more than 1,000 stores, or about a tenth of the total.Family Dollar said on Monday it was reviewing Dollar General's offer, but has not changed its recommendation in support for a merger with Dollar Tree.Family Dollar had agreed to a $74.50 per share cash and stock deal with Dollar Tree last month.Billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who in June took a 9.4 percent stake in Family Dollar, had pushed Family Dollar to sell itself to Dollar General.On Monday, Icahn said he was ""surprised"" by Family Dollar's deal with Dollar Tree.He questioned whether Family Dollar CEO Howard Levine's future role at Dollar Tree could have influenced the company to go ahead with the deal.Dollar Tree said last month that Levine would remain as Family Dollar CEO after the acquisition. Icahn has cut his stake in Family Dollar to 3.6 percent from 9.4 percent as of July 30.Activist investor Nelson Peltz-led Trian Partners was Family Dollar's second-largest shareholder as of July 27 with a 7.34 percent stake.Dollar Tree declined to comment.Dollar General's offer, made in a letter to Family Dollar's board, represents a premium of 3.2 percent to Family Dollar's Friday close.The enterprise value of the offer is $9.7 billion, higher than Dollar Tree's $9.2 billion.Dollar General's shares closed up 11 percent at $64.14, while Dollar Tree's shares closed down 2.4 percent at $54.26. ANTITRUST CONCERNS Dreiling, who said he would not have announced his retirement had he known a deal between Family Dollar and Dollar Tree was under way, said antitrust approval for Dollar General's bid was not a concern.Dollar General is prepared to divest up to 700 retail stores to get regulatory approval for the deal, the same percentage that Dollar Tree had proposed.Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough, however, said that more closings or divestitures might be needed.""Any market where they are dominant, and they are the only two players, is going to be questioned,"" he said. Antitrust lawyer Jared Bona of Bona Law, however, said the deal was likely to pass regulatory muster without much trouble.""I would be surprised if this deal is challenged under the antitrust laws because Dollar General is apparently willing to divest up to 700 retail stores to obtain antitrust approval.    Stating that up front means they probably don’t want a fight,"" he said. A U.S. Federal Trade Commission spokeswoman declined to comment. The FTC and the U.S. Justice Department share the responsibility for federal antitrust review of corporate mergers and acquisitions.Dollar General said it expected annual synergies of $550 million-$600 million three years after the deal closes. Dollar Tree had said it expected $300 million in annual savings by 2018. Dollar General has financing from Goldman Sachs and Citigroup Global Markets Inc for the deal, including a $305 million termination fee payable to Dollar Tree.

234,"   By Kim Palmer | CLEVELAND  CLEVELAND Ohio's attorney general said on Tuesday he has assigned a prosecutor with experience in police-involved shootings to investigate the death of a man shot while holding a BB gun at a Dayton-area Walmart.But lawyers for the family of John Crawford III, who was shot and killed by Beavercreek police earlier this month, said his death was unjustified, demanded that all surveillance video of the shooting be released and called for the case to be turned over to federal authorities.Attorney General Mike DeWine told reporters that Mark Piepmeier of Hamilton County has been assigned as the special prosecutor for the case, which will go before a special grand jury on Sept. 22. ""What happened on August 5 is a true tragedy ..."" DeWine said. ""Mr. Piepmeier will do everything in his power to seek justice in this case.""Crawford's death came a few days before the Aug. 9 fatal shooting by police in Ferguson, Missouri, of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, which is being investigated by the U.S. Justice Department and has focused national attention on the use of deadly force by police. Beavercreek police say they shot and killed Crawford because he was waving the BB gun and didn't drop it when commanded by police, according to local media accounts.Lawyers for the Crawford family and Crawford's father have viewed 5 to 6 minutes of surveillance video of the shooting.

238,"   By Karl Plume | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Retail giant Wal-Mart joined a group of volunteers counting corn ears and soybean pods in fields in the United States recently in a clear sign traditional crop tours are expanding their appeal from farmers and traders to all those with a stake in the U.S. food chain.These annual trips to gather detailed on-the-ground information on crops in the world's biggest grains producer have long been seen as a way to glean market-moving details not found in commodity analyst notes or government reports.But now their popularity is booming as a chance for those usually far from the field to develop relationships with growers themselves and to earn mud-on-the-boots credibility with clients and suppliers.The Pro Farmer crop tour last month involved 120 people, double the number a decade ago, from countries spanning Switzerland to Argentina, who travelled roughly 1,500 miles (2,500 km) across the Midwest and waded into more than 1,300 fields.Wal-Mart, known for its low prices, sent representatives for the first time on this tour, after trying out a wheat trip two years ago. It has a rising interest in food supplies, having grown its grocery business from around 7 percent a decade ago to over 70 percent of sales now.""We are always looking for ways to better understand our business. We attend farm tours to learn about crops so we can make smart buying decisions in our efforts to pass on savings to our customers,"" said Tim Robinson, Wal-Mart's director of dry grocery, who traveled from Ohio to Minnesota with the tour.After scouting a corn field in Ford County, Illinois, a roadside encounter with a farmer gave Robinson just such knowledge. The farmer said his crop, slated for delivery to snacks maker Frito-Lay, whose products pack Wal-Mart store shelves, was by far his best ever. That revelation echoed what Robinson had encountered all week: massive corn yields that have reduced grain costs for his suppliers to the lowest in years.Target Corp, which has also expanded grocery in recent years, declined to comment when asked if it would attend in future. Supervalu Inc, whose chains include Cub and Save-A-Lot, also did not attend but a spokesman said it regularly meets growers.Other new volunteers include analysts and traders a few states away to as far afield as Britain or Thailand who feel they get information which gives them an edge over competitors. ""You can only really understand a market by getting dirty and in ags that means you go get out and about and literally get mud on your boots,"" said Fiona Boal, a London-based analyst with asset manager Hermes on her third tour.She called back farmers she met on the tour to confirm that soybean growth had exploded after the rain-soaked excursion. ""That sort of anecdotal information from informed on-the-ground sources is invaluable to an investor,"" she said.Insights gleaned from the tour encouraged first-year participant Angie Maguire, a trader and elevator manager in Charlotte, Michigan, to lock in first quarter 2015 corn sales to a commercial buyer, confident that prices were likely to drop.""Some other folks may not step up and be willing to put sale on but I feel comfortable after seeing the crop,"" she said. The tours are not without critics, however, who say they focus on incomplete information that trickles out via phone, email and social media.Data from other tours, such as those hosted by Lanworth, a division of Thomson Reuters, or by forecaster MDA Weather Services, tends not to emerge until the end as they draw smaller crowds and information is shared with a limited client base.Corn and soybean futures each fell more than 1 percent during the Pro Farmer tour.

In addition to that, merchants also need to train staff and set up backend IT systems.Apple is betting on the popularity of its iPhones and the convenience and security of its payment system to prompt customers and retailers to make the shift.The technology will allow iPhone users to pay for anything from office supplies to burgers at the tap of a button, using their American Express Co, Visa Inc or Mastercard Inc bank cards.But Apple first needs to swiftly add more retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Best Buy Co Inc, which recently stopped accepting payments using NFC terminals.""At this point we have no plans to accept Apple Pay,"" Best Buy spokesman Jeff Shelman said. U.S. retailers have been notoriously slow when it comes to adopting new payment technology.They are already lagging in the adoption of payment systems that can read chip-enabled credit and debit cards, a move hastened by a massive data breach at Target Corp last Christmas.Trying to convince them to move to mobile-based payment terminals can be a big challenge.""Apple's tremendous failure yesterday was in demonstrating anything that was merchant-friendly,"" said Tom Noyes, chief executive of Commercesignal Inc, a data and payments company.""There is nothing they showed that wasn't possible 7 years ago.

241,"  (Repeats to fix formatting. No changes to text)By Jilian MincerNEW YORK, Sept 10 Alison LePard, a 19-year-old college sophomore from Wellesley, Massachusetts, says that when she shops for clothes and accessories, her goal is a look that is uniquely hers. So she does a lot of mixing and matching.""I don't blindly follow what they put out,"" LePard said of store displays. ""I don't want to wear just one brand. I don't want to be a stereotype.""She's hardly alone. Recent surveys have found that members of the U.S. Millennial Generation - the roughly 80 million Americans born between 1977 and 2000 - pride themselves on their individuality, and shop accordingly.Compared with their parents, millennials are far less likely to identify with a political party or to formally affiliate with a religion - key indicators of an independent streak - according to Pew Research Center. As shoppers, they are less attached to brands and more willing to create their own style, surveys by Nielsen, The Boston Consulting Group and other researchers have found.This generational trait is forcing retailers to rethink everything from their merchandise and marketing to their dressing rooms and logos. Some companies, including H&M and Urban Outfitters Inc, have ridden the individuality wave while others, such as Abercrombie & Fitch and Aeropostale, have been slow to react and are paying the price.At stake is the $600 billion millennials spend a year in the United States, according to Accenture, a sum that's projected to grow to an estimated $1.4 trillion in 2020, when the oldest of the cohort will be 43. Millennial men spend twice as much a year on apparel as non-millennial men, while millennial women outspent other generations by a third, the consultants said.Abercrombie's woes came into sharp relief last month when the company said it was shrinking its well-known logo and increasing its assortment of fashion for women, all to appeal more to 16- to 22-year-olds who don't want to look like everyone else. The move came after 10 straight declines in quarterly same-store sales.""They no longer want to be a walking billboard of a brand,"" said Michael Scheiner, an Abercrombie spokesman. ""Individualism is important to them, having their own sense of style."" Other companies are also adjusting their strategies to reach this elusive group.Gap Inc's new ad campaign, with the facetious tag line, ""dress normal,"" is all about creating an individual style, the idea being that there is no normal. Aeropostale, for its part, says its new product lines by blogger Bethany Mota are meant to convey ""authenticity, emotion and relevance.""Mall owners have had to adjust, too. Indianapolis-based Simon Property Group Inc is now working with fashion magazines and fashion website Refinery29.com to entice millennial shoppers to the mall with videos, new designers and personalized advice.""Not looking like everyone else is key to everything about what we do,"" said Chidi Achara, Simon's global creative director.The drive to reach millennials comes during a difficult environment for retailers. Retail spending was flat in August, according to the U.S. Commerce Department, and household spending dropped by 0.1 percent in July, the first decline since January. In August, retailers ranging from Wal-Mart Stores Inc  to Macy's Inc cut their sales forecasts. HOW MILLENNIALS SHOP Thanks to the Internet and smart phones, millennials are more informed shoppers than older generations. More than 70 percent of 18- to 34-year-olds recently surveyed by The Intelligence Group said they research options online before going to a store.Millennials spend a higher share of dollars online than other generations, according to market research and consulting firm NPD Group, though they still make 75 percent of their purchases at brick and mortar stores.With vast amounts of information easily available, they are savvy shoppers who know how to compare price, quality and convenience. Accustomed to building Facebook pages and other online identities, millennials are comfortable with the notion of mixing and matching different elements of their persona, a trait that carries over into their shopping choices, according to analysts and academics.To reach this first generation of ""digital natives,"" it's no longer enough for stores to offer a rack and a dressing room.""People are looking to create a unique identity,"" said Allen Adamson, an author and branding expert at Landor Associates. ""They want to put together their own story rather than have someone else tell them.""In addition to an inviting website and easy payment system, retailers are trying to make shopping more exciting for this over-stimulated generation. At H&M's midtown Manhattan store, for example, shoppers can strut their stuff on the store's fashion walk and then possibly have their video selected to be displayed outside.Gap is stressing that same aspiration with its new ""dress normal"" ad campaign, which uses taglines such as ""dress like no one's watching"" and ""simple clothes for you to complicate."" Sales at Gap stores fell 5 percent in the last quarter.The company said the ad campaign is aimed at customers who want to ""dress for themselves.""That certainly describes Brianne Casey, a 24-year-old New Yorker, who studied marketing and now works as an assistant to a buyer for a retail chain.Casey said she shops at a variety of stores to get the best prices and follows fashion trends on blogs to see what's hot. But in the end, she said, ""I like creating my own style.""(Reporting by Jilian Mincer; Editing by Eric Effron and John Pickering)",2014-09-10,WMT,"Wed Sep 10, 2014 | 1:28pm EDT",RPT-INSIGHT-Retailers give themselves makeover as millennials follow own beat,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-retail-millennials-insight-pix-video-idUSL1N0RB18Q20140910?type=companyNews

Some companies, including H&M and Urban Outfitters Inc, have ridden the individuality wave while others, such as Abercrombie & Fitch and Aeropostale, have been slow to react and are paying the price.At stake is the $600 billion millennials spend a year in the United States, according to Accenture, a sum that's projected to grow to an estimated $1.4 trillion in 2020, when the oldest of the cohort will be 43. Millennial men spend twice as much a year on apparel as non-millennial men, while millennial women outspent other generations by a third, the consultants said.Abercrombie's woes came into sharp relief last month when the company said it was shrinking its well-known logo and increasing its assortment of fashion for women, all to appeal more to 16- to 22-year-olds who don't want to look like everyone else. The move came after 10 straight declines in quarterly same-store sales.""They no longer want to be a walking billboard of a brand,"" said Michael Scheiner, an Abercrombie spokesman. ""Individualism is important to them, having their own sense of style."" Other companies are also adjusting their strategies to reach this elusive group.Gap Inc's new ad campaign, with the facetious tag line, ""dress normal,"" is all about creating an individual style, the idea being that there is no normal.

246,"  (Adds antitrust lawyer comment, background about the companies)By Soyoung Kim, Nadia Damouni and Olivia OranNEW YORK, Sept 9 U.S. retailer Dollar General Corp is preparing to go hostile as soon as this week in its bid to buy rival Family Dollar Stores, taking its $9.1 billion offer directly to shareholders after being spurned twice by its smaller rival, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.Dollar General could launch a tender offer for Family Dollar as soon as Wednesday, these people said, asking not to be named because the matter is not public.Family Dollar, which already has a deal to sell to Dollar Tree Inc for $8.5 billion, has rejected Dollar General's unsolicited approaches citing antitrust risks.Representatives for Dollar General and Family Dollar both declined to comment.Dollar General's expected hostile move could lead to a protracted takeover battle involving the nation's three largest U.S. dollar-store operators, at a time when these retailers are facing increasing competition from retailers like Wal-Mart and Target Corp. In its most recent offer made last week, Dollar General had added a $500 million break-up fee and increased the number of stores it is willing to sell to get antitrust approval to 1,500 from 700.Dollar General believes these new terms eliminated the antitrust risk for Family Dollar, people familiar with the matter said. But the rival rejected the sweetened bid, saying it still did not give the company sufficient protection.Family Dollar wants Dollar General to assume the entire risk of a deal getting shot down by U.S. regulators through a so-called ""hell or high water"" clause before agreeing to negotiate. Such a clause will commit the company to doing whatever it takes to complete the deal, such as carrying out any divestiture that antitrust regulators ask for.But Dollar General is not willing to offer such an assurance, partly because doing so could leave the retailer at the mercy of the antitrust regulators, who could demand huge divestitures, according to people familiar with the matter. Dollar General also believes it has already offered far more divestitures than is necessary to secure regulatory approval, the people said. While it is willing to sell off up to 1,500 stores if required by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, it still believes that the FTC will ask for far fewer to be divested, around 700, these people added.Some shareholders have questioned if Dollar General can find buyers for the stores that regulators would require them to sell. But the people familiar with the matter said there is a long list of potential buyers for such assets, including a handful of small box retailers such as Fred's, Happy Dollar and Five Below, as well as private equity firms. These buyers could be interested in dividing up the assets, the people said.A combined Dollar General-Family Dollar would have nearly 20,000 stores across 46 U.S. states and annual sales in excess of $28 billion. Family Dollar said it expects the FTC to challenge a deal with Dollar General, as it could lead to higher prices in areas where only the two retailers are present. The company said more than 6,000 Family Dollar stores have a Dollar General store within three miles. Many of those locations also do not have a third competitor, Wal-Mart Stores Inc.Dollar General has played down its rival's antitrust concerns, saying that Wal-Mart was the primary driver for its pricing decisions, not Family Dollar.The FTC would want to make sure that whoever buys the divested stores would be able to keep them open and profitable, said Claudia Higgins, an antitrust expert with the law firm Kaye Scholer, who is not involved in the deal.Higgins said that she had seen instances where a failure to find an appropriate buyer for divested assets did lead to the collapse of a deal but that this was not common and tended to happen in specialized industries.""Seems to me that somebody who runs drug stores would know how to run a store that sells sundries. Or the owner of a small grocery store. Or a private equity company that owns retailers,"" she said.Last week, Dollar Tree said it amended its merger agreement with Family Dollar to include a commitment to divest as many stores as necessary to clear antitrust hurdles. It had previously agreed to divest 500 stores.

251,"   By Siddharth Cavale | Sept 23  Sept 23 Snow Glow Elsa has a big job ahead of her - even for a princess with magical powers.The doll, one of only four toys to feature on three major guides of top toys for the holiday season, has the task of reviving Jakks Pacific Inc, which has reported losses for the last two years and declining revenue since 2009.Jakks is licensed to make toys and dresses based on Walt Disney Co's blockbuster animation movie ""Frozen"", including the Elsa doll.Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Toys R Us Inc and industry magazine Toy Insider have all picked the just-launched toy for their closely watched annual gifting guides.More than for Mattel Inc or Hasbro Inc - the top two U.S. toymakers - ""a toy that will be on a list like Wal-Mart will be of greater benefit for (Jakks) because of their smaller size,"" said Edward Woo, senior research analyst at investment bank Ascendiant Capital Markets LLC.The ""Frozen"" line could top $125 million in sales this year for Jakks, Woo said, with Snow Glow Elsa alone contributing $50 million. That's nearly 8 percent of Jakks' 2013 revenue of $632.9 million. Mattel had sales of $6.48 billion last year.Malibu, California-based Jakks, anticipating a bumper Christmas, has added more than five factories in China to ramp up production and iron out supply hurdles in its ""Frozen"" line of toys, Chief Executive Stephen Berman told Reuters.The company doesn't break out sales by product.Needham & Co's Sean McGowan, the top-rated analyst tracking Jakks according to Thomson Reuters StarMine, estimated sales of close to $100 million from the ""Frozen"" line this year. Sales so far total about $20 million, he said.Six of eight analysts covering Jakks, including McGowan, have a ""buy"" rating on the stock, with the median price target at $10. The shares, which have risen about 2 percent this year,  were trading around $6.80 on Tuesday. TURNAROUND YEAR Elsa, the misunderstood princess with a magical ability to create ice and snow, has emerged as a hot favorite character among girls since ""Frozen"" released in November.Jakks' Snow Glow version is a baby-faced doll with a dress that lights up and she sings the Oscar winning song ""Let it Go"" from the movie.The doll, aimed at girls aged 3 and above, is priced at $39.97 at Wal-Mart and at $34.99 at Toys R Us.Wal-Mart's top-20 list - based on a survey of about 1,000 children - pits the doll against some old favorites such as Mattel's never-say-die Barbie and gadgets such as LeapFrog Enterprises Inc's LeapTV, an educational gaming system with motion sensors. The Toys R Us list, which relies on research from in-house experts, features both Snow Glow Elsa and LeapTV, but no Barbie.It has another Jakks toy on its list: Max Tow, a monster truck toy powerful enough to pull and push objects weighing up to 200 pounds.Other than Snow Glow Elsa and LeapTV, the only toys that also feature on Toy Insider's gifting guide are Just Play's mobile clinic playset, based on the Doc McStuffins animated TV series, and Spin Master Ltd's Zoomer Dino, a gesture controlled T-rex on wheels.Jakks' toys have made it to previous lists, but demand for those hadn't built up like it has for the ""Frozen"" toys, said Jonathan Samet, publisher of the Toy Insider magazine.""This (year) is going to be a big turnaround for Jakks,"" Samet said. STOCKING UP, BUT FAST ENOUGH? The movie is already having an impact on Jakks, which began a restructuring last year.About a year after the toymaker suspended its dividend and announced job cuts, Jakks reported a 16.9 percent increase in revenue for the three months ended June 30, its biggest quarterly sales growth in at least five years.It also forecast a profit for the year.But the company's shares fell 14 percent amid concerns that the company may not be able to meet holiday demand.Since then, Berman said, the company has worked with its suppliers to ensure adequate supply.Some analysts aren't convinced.""(""Frozen"" is) a phenomenon, and as prepared as retailers are for the ""Frozen"" rush I think they will still be understocked,"" said Laurie Schacht, president of Adventure Publishing, which issues the Toy Insider list.Berman is thinking long-term, noting that merchandise spawned by the 1995 hit animation movie ""Toy Story"" were still big sellers.""Frozen"" is our generation's ""Toy Story"", he said.

252,"   By Brendan O'Brien  An Ohio grand jury on Wednesday decided not to press charges against two police officers who fatally shot a man while he held a pellet gun at a Dayton-area Walmart in August, prosecutors said. A special Green County grand jury voted not to indict two Beavercreek officers who shot and killed John Crawford III, 22, on Aug. 5 as he held a BB gun inside a local Walmart store, special prosecutor Mark Piepmeier told a news conference.  ""Based on the information the responding officers had and Mr. Crawford's failure to comply with the responding officers' orders, the officers did what they were trained to do to protect the public,"" the City of Beavercreek said in a statement. Crawford's death came a few days before the Aug. 9 fatal shooting by police in Ferguson, Missouri, of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, which is being investigated by the U.S. Justice Department and has focused national attention on the use of deadly force by police. Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine appointed Piepmeier as a special prosecutor in the case to look into whether the shooting was justified.The nine-member grand jury decided against indicting the Beavercreek officers on murder, reckless homicide or negligent homicide charges after hearing testimony from 18 witnesses and listening to and viewing hours of audio and video recordings of the incident, Piepmeier said.   A surveillance video released on Wednesday, aired on local television, showed Crawford picked up a BB gun off a shelf and strolled through the store with it until police shot him. Michael Wright, an attorney representing Crawford's family, was not immediately available for comment.  Officials in Beavercreek have asked the FBI to review the case to see whether Crawford's civil rights were violated. Ohio Governor John Kasich and Attorney General DeWine called on the U.S. Justice Department to review the case.""This is a tragedy for the Crawford family and I share the concern of many in the community that this matter must be handled with the utmost seriousness and respect,"" Kasich said.

253,"  LONDON, Sept 26 British grocer Sainsbury's  said on Friday that from Oct. 2 it will only benchmark prices with Wal-Mart's Asda, no longer including troubled market leader Tesco in its price comparison scheme.Sainsbury's ""Brand Match"" programme tots up prices of comparable brands in shoppers' trollies. If shoppers could have paid less at Asda they receive a coupon for the difference.A spokeswoman for Sainsbury's said the move reflected customer research which showed that ""Asda is seen as the benchmark on price.""The move forms part of a prices strategy from Sainsbury's that has seen it lower the regular prices of products across its grocery business. The spokeswoman said Sainsbury's had lowered base prices on about 1,200 lines over the last 18 months. She declined to say what the firm's total investment in prices had been over that period. Sainsbury's, which is battling with Asda to be Britain's No. 2 grocer, saw a nine-year run of quarterly sales growth come to an end in the fourth quarter of its 2013-14 financial year and posted another quarterly decline in sales in the first quarter of its 2014-15 year.Second quarter sales data will be published on Oct. 1, the first sales numbers to be presented by new Chief Executive Mike Coupe, who succeeded Justin King in July. Industry data published on Tuesday showed Sainsbury's sales fell 1.8 percent in the 12 weeks to Sept. 14 in an overall grocery market growing at its slowest rate for more than 20 years.On Monday Tesco was rocked by an accounting scandal, sending its shares sliding.

255,"  NEW YORK U.S. consumer sentiment finished September at its strongest in more than a year on growing optimism about the economy and more favorable outlook on future income, a survey released on Friday showed.The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's final September reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment finished at 84.6, the highest since July 2013, up from 82.5 at the end of August.The late September reading was unchanged from its initial figure and economists polled by Reuters had expected a reading of 84.7.""The main factor promoting greater confidence in September was more favorable prospects for the domestic economy as well as more favorable personal income expectations,"" survey director Richard Curtin said in a statement. Curtin said the September index reading, which was the second highest in the last seven years, signals an acceleration in consumer spending in the next 12 months, which might grow at a 2.7 percent pace.The survey's gauge of consumer expectations ended at 75.4 in late September, also the highest since July 2013 on a final basis though it was a tad lower than preliminary reading of 75.6 reported earlier in this month. It was higher than the 71.3 reading in August and above a forecast of 75.0. The survey's barometer of current economic conditions was 98.9 in late September, compared with 98.5 seen earlier this month. It was lower than August's 99.8 and above a forecast of 98.0. The survey's one-year inflation expectation fell to 3.0 percent from 3.2 percent and the survey's five-to-10-year inflation outlook was at 2.8 percent from 2.9 percent. The late September inflation readings were unchanged from their early September levels.

256,"   By Jason Lange | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. consumer spending accelerated in August, the government said on Monday, a positive sign for an economy that appears to be firing on nearly all cylinders.The housing sector remains an exception, however, with a separate report showing Americans signed fewer contracts in August to purchase previously owned homes.Nevertheless, the rise in household spending offered the latest suggestion that years of exceptionally low interest rates have finally pushed the economy into a higher gear.Consumer spending rose 0.5 percent last month after being unchanged in July, the Commerce Department said. The growth in August was just above the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. Millan Mulraine, an economist at TD Securities in New York called the data ""a further signal that the positive momentum in domestic activity is being sustained.""Even after adjusting for inflation, spending was 0.5 percent higher, the biggest gain since March. Growth in personal income ticked up 0.3 percent, in line with forecasts.Some of the strength in spending came from a decrease in the saving rate, which eased back from a 1-1/2-year high in July. On Wall Street, housing shares .HGX fell even more than the broader stock indexes, which were down sharply as investors focused attention on civil unrest in Hong Kong.  INFLATION MUTED Most investors are betting the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next year to keep inflation in check, although Monday's data gave little sign of growing price pressures.The Fed's preferred gauge of inflation was up 1.5 percent in August from a year earlier, down slightly from the reading in July, the Commerce Department data showed. A measure of underlying price pressures which strips out food and energy held at 1.5 percent. That reading had dipped to 1.2 percent earlier this year.Some policymakers at the U.S. central bank remain concerned that inflation appears stuck well below their 2 percent target. Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans repeated on Monday his argument that the Fed should be patient when it comes to raising rates. Data on Friday showed the economy grew at its fastest pace in 2-1/2 years in the second quarter. Still, the housing sector has struggled to recover from the 2007-09 recession when a home price bubble deflated. In August, contracts to purchase previously owned U.S. homes fell 1.0 percent, the National Association of Realtors said.The pending home sales index plunged last year after mortgage interest rates spiked, although it has been on a rising trend since this past March.

260,"   By Sam Forgione | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. consumer confidence fell in September for the first time in five months and home prices in July rose less than expected from a year earlier, underscoring the unsteady nature of U.S. growth. Another report on Tuesday showed business activity growth in the U.S. Midwest decelerated slightly in September.""We're continuing to effectively struggle,"" said Mike Englund, chief economist at Action Economics in Boulder, Colorado. ""Some of the optimism that we got in the updraft in consumer confidence in the third quarter was probably a bit overstated.""The Conference Board, an industry group, said its index of consumer attitudes fell to 86.0 in September from a upwardly revised 93.4 the month before. Economists had expected a reading of 92.5, according to a Reuters poll. Consumer confidence was hurt by concerns over the job market and expectations that economic growth will slow in coming months. The S&P/Case Shiller composite index of home prices in 20 metropolitan areas gained 6.7 percent in July year over year, shy of expectations for a 7.5 percent rise. On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, prices in the 20 cities fell 0.5 percent in July. A Reuters poll of economists had forecast a flat reading. ""The home price data suggests that we haven't entirely repaired the home sales process,"" said Englund. ""We have a housing market where people who are dependent on credit to buy homes are finding that homes aren't as easy to buy as they used to be.""In a third report, the Institute for Supply Management-Chicago business barometer fell to 60.5 this month from 64.3 in August, falling short of economists' expectations for 61.9. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the regional economy. U.S. stocks traded slightly lower as the dollar rose and weighed on multinational companies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.

261,"   By Nathan Layne and Siddharth Cavale  Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the biggest U.S. private sector employer, said on Tuesday that its 1.3 million workers would have to pay more for healthcare and it would end benefits for some part-time staff in a move that could prompt other companies to follow suit.The world's largest retailer said it would raise health insurance premiums for its entire U.S. workforce beginning in January. In addition, Wal-Mart will end coverage for employees who work fewer than 30 hours a week, a change that will impact 2 percent of U.S. workers, or about 30,000 people.The move comes as U.S. companies brace for a January 2015 deadline under the Affordable Care Act. Starting then, companies with 50 or more employees will have to offer health insurance to those working at least 30 hours a week, a mandate that has drawn criticism from some companies worried about higher costs.Wal-Mart, which announced the change in a blogpost on Tuesday, had cited health care expenses as a problem in August, when it cut its 2014 profit forecast. It said more people than expected had enrolled in its plans and its annual forecast for health care costs had risen by 50 percent.""Like every company, Wal-Mart continues to face rising health care costs,"" Sally Welborn, senior vice president of global benefits, wrote in the blogpost on the company's website. ""This year, the expenses were significant and led us to make some tough decisions as we begin our annual enrollment.""Wal-Mart said the bi-weekly premiums for its most popular and lowest-cost employee-only plans will rise by $3.50 to $21.90, which represents a 19 percent increase.

Target Corp (TGT.N) and Home Depot Inc (HD.N) recently announced cuts to benefits in light of the Affordable Care Act.According to consulting firm Mercer, 62 percent of large retailers did not offer health-care benefits to part-time workers as of 2013, a comparatively high rate that reflects low wages and high turnover in the industry. That figure drops to 37 percent for companies overall. Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at Edward Jones, said the decision by Wal-Mart could force other retailers to rethink what benefits they provide.  All retailers are ""trying to cut expenses, to keep things lean,"" Yarbrough said. ""At some point you start looking across the board, and this is probably the next place to start looking at cuts.""SILVER LINING?

Speaking to reporters on Air Force One, he said the difference now is that workers “have a legitimate alternative where they can acquire high-quality, affordable health care, and that is through the marketplaces that were constructed by the Affordable Care Act.” Others also noted a potential silver lining for some employees who could now apply for government subsidies on the public exchanges for which they would not have been eligible if covered by a corporate plan.“There is another way employees can get coverage and for some employees it will actually may be a good thing because they’ll get a subsidy,"" said Beth Umland, research director for health and benefits at Mercer. Wal-Mart's Welborn said on a conference call that the company had not yet figured out how much it would save by cutting benefits.

264,"   By Nathan Layne  Oct 10 Lower gasoline prices are expected to fuel higher retail sales this winter, especially at Wal-Mart Stores and other chains that cater to low- to middle-income shoppers, analysts said.The average price at the pump dropped to $3.24 a gallon on Friday, down 11 percent from three months earlier and the lowest level in October since 2010, according to AAA. The motorist group predicts the price will fall below $3 in the coming months.Analysts said such a drop would give consumers more disposable income.""The discount stores, the middle tier retailer will benefit,"" said Chris Christopher, director at IHS Economics, adding that spending at higher end retailers is more closely connected to the stock market than prices at the pump. Spending on gasoline accounts for a much bigger chunk of the budget in lower-income brackets. A household making between $20,000 and $30,000 spends about 8 percent of income on gas, while a family bringing in more than $70,000 a year spends about 3 percent, IHS estimates.If the average gas price settles around $3.10 to $3.20 through the spring, that could unlock $35 billion to $50 billion in total savings for U.S. consumers during the next 12 months, investment bank Cowen estimates. Given that tailwind, Cowen predicted that the stocks of discount apparel retailers TJX Companies and Ross Stores were poised to gain. Gilford Securities raised its rating on Wal-Mart on Friday to ""buy"" from ""neutral."" Analyst Bernard Sosnick didn't cite cheaper gas as a factor behind the upgrade, but he said it could help Wal-Mart claw back some business lost to more centrally located dollar stores in recent years.""It's a significant factor for Wal-Mart because supercenters are often located a distance from shoppers, and when gas prices are high they tend to seek out more convenient locations,"" Sosnick said. Less expensive gas is no panacea for the retail industry. Higher food prices and tepid wage growth are among the factors that could temper any sales bump generated by lower prices at the pump, analysts and economists said.Adjusted for inflation, the average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory employees came to $8.85 in August, up just 7 cents from the same month a year earlier and lower than in August 2010, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show.For some investors that's reason enough to stay away from Wal-Mart shares. The stock rose 0.6 percent to $78.29 on Friday but is still down about 2 percent since mid-May 2013 when it announced the first of six straight quarters of falling or flat same-store sales in the United States. During the same period the S&P 500 index has gained 2 percent.""Wal-Mart shoppers have not seen wage gains in a long time, so they don't have a lot more money to spend,"" said Michael Farr, president of Farr, Miller & Washington.

In August, it cut its earnings guidance due to higher enrollments in its health care plan.Wal-Mart pinned the latest revision on a stronger dollar, which cuts into the value of its overseas sales, and the reduction in food stamp benefits in November 2013, which hit the shopping budgets of many of its customers.Wal-Mart has posted six straight quarters of flat or declining growth in same-store sales, and the lower sales forecast suggests a recovery could take longer than anticipated. The company did not provide a timetable for a pickup in growth. In another sign of its cautious view on the U.S. market, the company said it would slow store openings in the next financial year. Including conversions, it plans to open 60 to 70 Supercenters, its large-format stores that contain full-sized supermarkets, down from 115 this year. It plans to open 180 to 200 of its smaller format stores next year, compared with a rollout of 270 to 300 in the current year.The cautious stance makes sense given the slow economy and with its core customers facing hard times financially, said J. Dowe Bynum of Cook & Bynu Capital Management, a fund based in Alabama that owns Wal-Mart shares. ""They want to be careful and thoughtful about that build out. They have the financial wherewithal to ramp it up when the economy is stronger and can absorb it."" Chief Executive Douglas McMillon said the move was part of a pivot toward ecommerce, an area in which it is growing rapidly but is still playing catch-up with Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). McMillon said the ultimate winners in online would be those players that could also leverage traditional stores.""We've done the harder part,"" McMillion said, a nod to Wal-Mart's global network of more than 11,000 stores.Wal-Mart said it expected moderate growth in the next financial year to January 2016 as well, with sales to expand by 2 to 4 percent and operating income increasing at the same rate or slower.That company said it would increase investment in e-commerce and digital operations by up to $500 million from $1 billion this year, including the building of two new fulfillment centers in the United States. Wal-Mart is not the only retailer to stumble on hard times. Government data on Wednesday showed that U.S. retail sales declined in September as consumers pulled back on spending for a range of items. EBay Inc (EBAY.O) also trimmed its full-year revenue forecast on Wednesday. Wal-Mart acknowledged that some of problems were self-inflicted. McMillon said there was ""room to improve"" at many of its stores, including better checkout and stocking of shelves, two problems that have plagued the retailer in recent years.Greg Foran, who recently took over as head of the U.S. business, said inventory was growing at twice the rate of sales and needed to be managed more efficiently.

268,"  (Corrects location in fourth paragraph to Rogers, Arkansas, from  Fayetteville, Arkansas)Oct 15 Wal-Mart Stores Inc cut its annual sales forecast on Wednesday, citing a stronger dollar and the impact of food stamp reductions, and said it would slow store openings in the next financial year as it shifts spending to its online business.Shares of the world's largest retailer extended losses after the announcement of the sales guidance cut. They closed 3.6 percent lower at $75.2.Wal-Mart, which recorded $473.1 billion in sales in its last financial year, said it now expects sales to rise 2-3 percent in the current year to Jan. 31, 2015. It had previously estimated growth at the low end of a 3-5 percent range. ""We experienced a tougher sales environment globally than we anticipated a year ago,"" Chief Financial Officer Charles Holley told an annual meeting with investors and analysts held in Rogers, Arkansas, not far from the company's headquarters.The two biggest factors holding back growth have been the stronger U.S. currency, which hits the profits of its overseas businesses, and a reduction in food stamp benefits, which cut into the budgets of low-income consumers who form the core of its customer base in the United States. Wal-Mart said it expected revenues to expand 2-4 percent in the next financial year to January 2016, with operating income growing at the same rate or slower than sales, relecting up to $500 million in additional investments in its e-commerce business.Wal-Mart has posted six straight quarters of flat or declining growth in same-store sales, and the lower sales forecast suggests a recovery could take longer than anticipated.

272,"   By Nandita Bose | CHICAGO  CHICAGO By selling directly to Chinese consumers on Alibaba's platform, a move announced Tuesday, Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST.O) aims to employ local knowledge and a low-cost structure to avoid missteps that caused even the world's largest retailer, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT.N), to stumble.Many global retailers opening in China have struggled to find product mixes and store designs favored by local customers. Besides Wal-Mart, Best Buy (BBY.N), eBay (EBAY.O) and others have fallen short of expectations in one of the fastest-growing consumer markets.Costco's virtual storefront on Alibaba Group Holding's (BABA.N) Tmall is designed to help the warehouse store operator study consumer shopping habits with no brick-and-mortar costs and fewer risks, signaling a new approach to expanding in China. ""This shows Costco has learned from the mistakes made by companies like Wal-Mart and also those who were forced to exit the market like Home Depot (HD.N),"" said Anjee Solanki, national director of retail services at Colliers International.Wal-Mart's China sales in the second quarter grew 1.1 percent, but same-store sales, a key figure, declined 1.6 percent. David Cheesewright, head of Wal-Mart's international division, acknowledged at the company's investor conference Wednesday that China remains tough even after 17 years. ""We are still very much focused on building our foundations,"" he said.Early steps at times have been shaky. Wal-Mart stuck with its big-box format even though Chinese consumers prefer neighborhood stores. And its stores in China, including Sam's Club warehouses, offered few high margin private-label goods until as recently as last year. Even Wal-Mart's ""Everyday Low Prices"" slogan backfired. Chinese consumers equate inexpensive with unsafe and value quality as much as bargain prices, retail consultants said. Supply-chain problems came to a head in January when Wal-Mart recalled its popular ""Five Spice"" donkey meat after tests showed traces of fox meat. The recall followed episodes involving tainted milk and recycled ""gutter oil"" sold as cooking oil in the market.Despite the difficulties, Wal-Mart has become China's third-largest retailer, behind Sun Art Retail Group Ltd and state-backed China Resources Enterprise Ltd, according to consultant Kantar Retail.Wal-Mart has made adjustments, too. Last December it announced plans to boost private-label sales to a 20 percent share within a decade, and Wal-Mart has built its own distribution centers to manage product quality.  ""We've done a lot of work on building trust,"" Cheesewright said. TESTING THE WATERS Costco's decision to partner with Alibaba is designed to bring local credibility to the Issaquah, Washington-based retailer. China-based iResearch in July forecast sales of 2.76 trillion yuan ($446.6 billion) for the year, up 45.8 percent from 2013. Virtual storefronts are a growing business on Tmall, one of the world's fastest-growing business-to-consumer marketplaces, with a 50 percent share in China. Tmall lists more than 100,000 brands, about 2,000 of them foreign-made.   ""Digital storefronts are a powerful tool to help shape what a retailer might want to do with a physical store,"" said Marcie Merriman, executive director of retail strategy and customer engagement at EY.  Costco is opening in China with its well-regarded and high-margin private-label Kirkland brand, which sells everything from men's shirts to laundry detergents, aimed at quality-conscious Chinese consumers. Even so, price competition likely will be fierce with Yihaodian, a website in which Wal-Mart is majority owner. As part of an introductory ""Shopping Spree"" on Tmall, Costco offered four packs of Sensodyne toothpaste at 145 yuan, or $23.68, compared with 109 yuan on Yihaodian. Partnering with Alibaba, a symbol of China's economic maturation, may even provide political benefit, a concern at a time when foreign companies have found themselves jousting with the Chinese government. ""We believe (Costco's) worry has always been that if they got it right in China, and returns exceeded the cost of capital, they would quickly gain a new partner in the Chinese government,"" Janney Capital Markets said in a note. LOGISTICS CONCERNS The tie-up with Alibaba is not without risk. Costco's plan to rely on Tmall warehouses to reduce logistics costs and shorten delivery times may risk creating logistics problems similar to those Wal-Mart has faced. ""Letting Alibaba handle a lot of their supply chain is a good short-term solution,"" said Colliers' Solanki. ""But (product) safety is a big issue with supply chains in China, and that has to be managed well."" Rob Howard, chief executive officer of San Francisco-based local delivery firm Grand Junction, said the Alibaba partnership could put Costco in a system that often favors local players. ""It's more of a cobbled-together, relationship-driven infrastructure,"" he said. ""It's hard for an external person to tap into that effectively, and Alibaba has that all nailed.""

274,"  (Repeats story that ran on Wednesday)SAN FRANCISCO Oct 15 EBay Inc on Wednesday joined Wal-Mart Stores Inc in cutting its outlook for the all-important holiday season, suggesting that the fourth quarter may turn out to be weaker than some analysts predicted as recently as last week.The warnings from two of the retail industry's most influential players comes as investors re-assess the state of the global economy after weak data this week from the two largest countries, the United States and China.EBay and Wal-Mart blamed divergent factors such as food stamp reductions and unfavorable search-engine optimization for the lower outlooks.Both complained about the stronger dollar putting the skids on their forecasts, lowering the value of overseas sales once converted into the U.S. currency.But analysts say stagnant incomes are also prompting U.S. consumers to curtail spending.""EBay, especially on the marketplaces side, is actually suffering from company-specific setbacks,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Gil Luria said. ""But overall, if e-commerce was growing faster or as fast as it was last year or a couple years ago, it would have probably helped them hide that."" DOLLARS AND CENTS EBay's fourth-quarter outlook was undercut by the strength of the dollar against the British pound, the euro and the Australian dollar, which together account for 35 percent of eBay's volume.The stronger dollar alone forced eBay to cut its fourth-quarter revenue outlook by $120 million. Coupled with slower-than-expected growth in its marketplaces division, eBay was forced to lop off $300 million from its annual revenue forecast. ""As expected, (retail) sales have accelerated in the second half of the year, though economic signals remain mixed and consumers are still facing headwinds such as weak income growth,"" Moody's analyst Michael Zuccaro wrote on Wednesday.The more measured tone may spook investors as retailers such as Amazon.com Inc and Target release results over the next month. Investors and analysts had expressed high hopes for the holiday season as recently as last week.The National Retail Federation, in a press release entitled ""optimism shines,"" predicted strengthening consumer confidence would trigger a 4.1 percent spike in November-December retail sales, outpacing the 3.1 percent seen in the same period of 2013. But the group also warned that consumers remained uneasy about economic conditions, echoing concerns from other analysts including those at Moody's.Two-thirds of Americans are limiting how much they spend each month, according to a Bankrate.com report released this week. The top reason was stagnant incomes.eBay Chief Executive John Donahoe told Reuters he was ""cautiously optimistic"" about the holiday season but declined to discuss the topic further.In a sign of its cautious view on the U.S. market, Wal-Mart said it would slow store openings in the next fiscal year.Wal-Mart, which recorded $473.1 billion in sales in its last fiscal year, said it now expects sales to rise 2-3 percent in the current year to Jan. 31, 2015.

275,"  PARIS, Oct 16 European stocks were set to rise on Thursday, taking a breather after the previous session's steep sell-off, as investors took comfort in corporate results from bellwethers such as pharma group Roche  and food giant Nestle.     Roche reaffirmed its full-year sales and profit targets after a strong performance by its new breast cancer drugs helped it beat expectations in the third quarter.      Food group Nestle posted sales that were roughly in line with analyst forecast and stood by its full-year outlook.      At 0630 GMT, futures for Euro STOXX 50, for UK's FTSE 100, for Germany's DAX and for France's CAC were up 0.5-0.8 percent.     Shire will be in the spotlight again after U.S. pharmaceutical company AbbVie Inc recommended that shareholders vote against its $55 billion takeover of Shire in the wake of a U.S. government move to curb deals designed to cut high taxes. Shares in Shire tumbled 23 percent on Wednesday after AbbVie said it was reconsidering its bid.     European stocks sank on Wednesday, with the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares losing 3.2 percent, its biggest one-day slide since late 2011, hurt by mounting worries about global growth.     The slump represented a wipe-off in market value of about $255 billion for European stocks listed on the broad STOXX Europe 600 index. That is more than Portugal's GDP and more than the entire market capitalisation of Europe's biggest oil company, Royal Dutch Shell.     Adding to worries, Wal-Mart Stores Inc cut its annual sales forecast on Wednesday, citing a stronger dollar and the impact of food stamp reductions.       On Thursday, the Swiss government cut its economic growth forecasts for this year and next for the second time, citing the gloomy outlook for the neighbouring euro zone, its main export market. It cut its forecast to 1.8 percent from 2.0 percent for 2014 and to 2.4 percent from 2.6 percent for 2015.       Investors have been slashing exposure to European stocks following a string of soft macro data, particularly from Germany, which has fuelled deflation worries.     On Wednesday, Washington renewed a warning that Europe risks falling into a downward spiral of falling wages and prices, saying recent actions by the European Central Bank may not be enough to ward off deflation.     In a semiannual report to Congress, the U.S. Treasury Department also said Berlin could do more to help Europe, namely by boosting demand in the German economy, Europe's largest.

276,"  Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) plans to improve opportunities for its employees so that in the future there will no longer be a few thousand workers on its payroll making minimum wage, the chief executive of the world's top retailer said on Wednesday. The act of upgrading minimum wage positions would be largely a symbolic move for Wal-Mart. Currently only about 6,000 workers make the minimum out of its U.S. workforce of 1.3 million. Wal-Mart says its average full-time hourly wage is $12.92, compared with the federal minimum wage of $7.25. But the comments from CEO Douglas McMillon could draw some attention amid the contentious national debate over proposals to raise the minimum wage. Wal-Mart is the largest private employer in the U.S. and a prime target of labor activists who say it doesn't pay workers a living wage.   ""We only have a few thousand associates in the U.S., less than 6,000 of our 1.3 million associates in the U.S., that currently make a minimum wage and it is our intention over time that we will be in a situation where we don't pay minimum wage at all,"" McMillon told reporters on Wednesday when asked about the issue following an investor conference.McMillon said the move would be part of a larger effort to ""invest in its associate base"". It could also look at using promotions and bonus payments to improve opportunities for workers, he said. He didn't disclose further details.  OUR Walmart, a workers' group that's been pushing for the retailer to pay higher wages, is organizing two rallies on Thursday - one in New York and one in Washington D.C. - to put a spotlight on the issue, a spokeswoman for the group said.

283,"  TOKYO Panasonic Corp said it is transferring its Sanyo television unit in the U.S., which supplies sets to Wal-Mart Stores, to Funai Electric Co. of Japan in return for annual royalty payments.The move allows Panasonic (6752.T) to exit an unprofitable business.The transfer of the unit will likely be completed before the end of March, a spokesman for Panasonic said on Sunday, after the Nihon Keizai newspaper reported it would sell the business to Funai Electric (6839.T). Shedding the Sanyo business fits with Panasonic's strategy of pulling back for consumer electronics in a bid to improve profitability.

287,"   By Nandita Bose and Nathan Layne | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Some large U.S. retailers are refusing to use Apple Inc's APPL.O new electronic payments service as they commit to developing a rival payments system that would bolster their profits by eliminating credit card transaction fees.Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) is among the roughly 50 big retailers that have chosen not to accept Apple Pay, along with Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) and CVS HealthCorp (CVS.N).They say they are working instead on developing their own payment system, called Current C, through the Merchants Customer Exchange (MCX) consortium.The driving force behind developing a retailer-owned mobile payment solution is to avoid paying credit card transaction fees to card companies like Visa (V.N) and Mastercard (MA.N), analysts said. Fees range between 2 percent and 3 percent of costs per transaction.""""The economics and benefits of having your own payment system is definitely one of the main reasons,"" said Hitesh Sheth, chief executive of retail technology cybersecurity firm Vectra Networks.Apple did not immediately respond to queries seeking comment. Mastercard criticized the move by CVS and Rite Aid, saying it would limit the options of consumers. ""We are disappointed that both Rite Aid and CVS have decided to block their customers from using the payment method of their choice,"" Mastercard spokesman Jim Issokson said. Apple Pay, unveiled just last month, is a mobile payment app that allows consumers to buy things by simply holding their iPhone6 and 6 Plus devices up to readers installed by store merchants.The retailers shunning Apple Pay have also refused to use mobile payment systems like Google Wallet and Softcard. Rite Aid stopped accepting Apple Pay last week at its 4,572 stores. Spokeswoman Ashley Flower said on Monday the company is continually evaluating various forms of mobile payment technologies.CVS did not respond to queries seeking comment but a visit to two CVS stores showed the NFC (Near Field Communications) reader on which Apple Pay was used has been deactivated.Wal-Mart spokesman Randy Hargrove said Wal-Mart is not participating in Apple Pay at this point. It is focused instead on MCX, as one of the heavyweights in the consortium. Target said that it supports MCX but is also allowing users to make online purchases through its mobile app using Apple Pay.Antitrust experts said CVS and Rite Aid have the right to drop a vendor if they believe they can save money by going around the credit card companies and Apple, both of which will take a piece of the action.But they could run into antitrust trouble if they coordinated on dropping Apple Pay and Google Wallet or if someone else, perhaps a person working with CurrentC, organized their decision to drop Apple and Google’s payment services.""If I was a regulator, I would want to take a look at that,” said Peter Carstensen, who teaches antitrust at the University of Wisconsin Law School.

288,"   By Nathan Layne and Nandita Bose | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Suddenly it's Apple versus Wal-Mart in the fight for shoppers' digital wallets.With the development of a new mobile payment system, a group of retailers led by Wal-Mart Stores (WMT.N) is aiming to upend the $4.5 trillion credit card market and control the precious transaction data generated at the checkout line.    The difficulty of the task became clear this week when drugstore chains CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) and Rite Aid (RAD.N), in a move apparently aimed at shoring up the retailers' pay system, stopped accepting payments on Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iPhones. That prompted consumers to complain that they were being denied a user-friendly payment option.The “skirmish,” as Apple CEO Tim Cook put it this week, is the latest dispute to emerge from the Byzantine world of payment systems, which is dominated by banks and credit card firms. Many payment experts said they are skeptical that the retailer-backed system, known as CurrentC, can gain traction, let alone thwart Apple Pay, a payment system launched by the iPhone maker last week. CurrentC is set to go live in 2015.The retailers' main objective appears to be to push credit card companies out of the payment equation, or at least get them to lower their costs.""CurrentC is built for retailers, to help them cut out interchange fees,"" said Nick Aceto, senior director at payment technology firm CardConnect, referring to the fees paid by retailers to credit card companies when a shopper makes a purchase. ""It's not a solution that will appeal to customers because it does not make their lives any easier.""That's not stopping the retailers from trying, and their consortium, the Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX), has clout, with $1 trillion in annual sales. In addition to Wal-Mart, its members include Best Buy Co (BBY.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N).     MCX officials said CurrentC will work on any phone, integrating loyalty programs and payments into one transaction. While the group's focus is helping consumers, they said, it hopes to shake up the payment system.""MCX and the merchants that founded MCX are challenging ... an entrenched, very large status quo, a $500 billion ecosystem on the payments side,"" Chief Executive Dekkers Davidson said on a conference call Wednesday.    Davidson said MCX has made arrangements with two credit card companies and wants to partner with large issuers. But he did not say whether MCX would be willing to work with the likes of  Visa Inc (V.N) and Mastercard Inc (MA.N) and pay them conventional rates on interchange fees. Eventually, he said, ""We expect that all cards will be welcome at CurrentC.""    Wal-Mart, which has made little secret of its disdain for paying processing charges, is suing Visa for $5 billion for what it says are excessive card swipe fees.     Credit card firms typically charge 2 percent to 3 percent of the value of each transaction. Retailers paid $66 billion in credit-card-related fees in 2013, out of $4.5 trillion in spending tied to major U.S. cards, according to the Nilson Report.    In contrast to Apple Pay, which encrypts payment data and keeps it out of the hands of retailers, CurrentC connects directly to a customer's bank account. It will allow retailers to glean valuable data on spending patterns, which they can use to better target advertising and drive loyalty programs.There would be no pooling of data across retailers, Davidson said, and shoppers can opt to remain anonymous. ""Consumers will determine how they are marketed to or not marketed to,"" he said.        MCX says CurrentC will be secure, an assertion that was tested on Wednesday when the group confirmed that hackers had obtained the e-mail addresses of some participants in a pilot program.     While Wal-Mart has said it has no plans to support Apple Pay, its rival Target is taking a more nuanced approach. Target has said it plans to use MCX for in-store checkout but is allowing Apple Pay for online purchases through its mobile app. Target is featured on the Apple Pay website.     MCX members have made up-front payments of $200,000 to  $500,000 to join the group and signed multiyear agreements, according to people familiar with contract terms.    MCX said on Wednesday that when retailers join the consortium they do so on an exclusive basis, but there are no fines if they leave the group.    Walgreen Co WAG.N, a rival to CVS and Rite Aid, said it decided to offer Apple Pay to give its customers more options.    “It is ultimately about providing the choice to customers because no one really knows how this space will evolve,” said Deepika Pandey, head of digital marketing at the pharmacy.

290,"  Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) said on Thursday it would close 30 underperforming stores in Japan, scaling back in what was once considered one of the retailer's most promising markets and highlighting the hurdles it faces to securing growth overseas. Wal-Mart said the 30 stores operate under the Seiyu brand, and the closure is part of a revamp that will include remodels and other investments. The closures represent 7 percent of Wal-Mart's 434 stores in Japan.Wal-Mart first invested in Seiyu in 2002 and took full control of the company in 2008 with the aim of employing its low-cost model to win share from entrenched rivals like Aeon Co (8267.T) and Seven & i Holdings Co (3382.T).But the closures show how Seiyu has sometimes struggled to meet the notoriously picky tastes of Japanese consumers and leverage its scale to drive out competition via lower prices to the extent that it has in the United States. Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove said that overall the company's Japan operations were performing well, with sales and profits expected to grow for a sixth consecutive year in 2014. He said Seiyu's online revenues were growing at a fast clip.Wal-Mart estimated that the store closures would result in charges of about 4 cents to 5 cents of diluted earnings per share, which it will record over the next several quarters. Wal-Mart said that it would invest in upgrading its fresh and deli categories and remodel about 50 stores in 2015. It said it would also increase its fulfillment and service operations to meet growing demand for online delivery in the Tokyo area.The changes come as Wal-Mart is trying to find new growth overseas, where it operates around 6,000 stores and generates about a third of its overall sales.

295,"  Wal-Mart Stores Inc said it will expand its offering of discounted products during the holiday season and may broaden a price-matching scheme to include online rivals, in the latest sign of an escalating price war among big U.S. retailers.Wal-Mart said it was bracing for competition to be as tough or tougher than in 2013, when heavy discounting depressed earnings across the industry. Wal-Mart's profits dropped in the holiday quarter last year and it has posted six straight quarters of flat or declining same-store sales.“It is starting to heat up right now, and I would expect it to be at least as competitive as last year,"" Steve Bratspies, executive vice president of general merchandise for Wal-Mart's U.S. operations, said on a call with media on Thursday, referring to competition during the holiday season.Wal-Mart said it plans to have 20,000 ""rollbacks"", or a product discounted for at least 90 days, on offer starting on Saturday. While it did not disclose a comparable number, it said the program was bigger and included a wider line-up of products, with a focus on toys and electronics, than last year.Other retailers have been stepping up promotions, with a focus on attracting more customers online. Target Corp said earlier this month that it would drop shipping fees for online purchases from Oct. 22 to Dec. 22.Wal-Mart said it would provide free shipping for online orders of a selected list of 100 gift items. It normally waves shipping for purchases above $50.Wal-Mart is also considering expanding a price-matching program for local bricks-and-mortar rivals to include online comparisons, Bratspies said, although he stressed a final decision on the strategy had not been made. It would mean Wal-Mart matching prices with Amazon.com in addition to local retailers and grocery stores. The moves come ahead of what is expected to be a fiercely competitive year-end season. Research firm Customer Growth Partners (CGP) predicts spending will rise 3.4 percent, up slightly from last year's 2.9 percent growth, which was the slowest growth since 2009.""Demand is sluggish and consumers of all stripes are looking for value,"" said Craig Johnson, president of CGP. ""This is going to be a pretty promotional Christmas."" However, Johnson said he expects Wal-Mart to return to same-store sales growth in its fiscal fourth quarter, helped by food inflation, strong demand for consumer electronics and a move to put labor back in stores to address long checkout lines and better stock shelves. Wal-Mart said it planned to hire 60,000 additional workers for the holidays, up 10 percent from last year, and would aim to have all of its cash registers open during peak hours.

Wal-Mart's profits dropped in the holiday quarter last year and it has posted six straight quarters of flat or declining same-store sales.""It is starting to heat up right now, and I would expect it to be at least as competitive as last year,"" Steve Bratspies, executive vice president of general merchandise for Wal-Mart's U.S. operations, said on a call with media on Thursday, referring to competition during the holiday season.Wal-Mart said it plans to have 20,000 ""rollbacks"", or a product discounted for at least 90 days, on offer starting on Saturday. While it did not disclose a comparable number, it said the program was bigger and included a wider line-up of products, with a focus on toys and electronics, than last year.Other retailers have been stepping up promotions, with a focus on attracting more customers online. Target Corp said earlier this month that it would drop shipping fees for online purchases from Oct. 22 to Dec. 22.Wal-Mart said it would provide free shipping for online orders of a selected list of 100 gift items. It normally waves shipping for purchases above $50. Wal-Mart is also considering expanding a price-matching program for local bricks-and-mortar rivals to include online comparisons, Bratspies said, although he stressed a final decision on the strategy had not been made. It would mean Wal-Mart matching prices with Amazon.com in addition to local retailers and grocery stores.The moves come ahead of what is expected to be a fiercely competitive year-end season. Research firm Customer Growth Partners (CGP) predicts spending will rise 3.4 percent, up slightly from last year's 2.9 percent growth, which was the slowest growth since 2009. ""Demand is sluggish and consumers of all stripes are looking for value,"" said Craig Johnson, president of CGP. ""This is going to be a pretty promotional Christmas.""However, Johnson said he expects Wal-Mart to return to same-store sales growth in its fiscal fourth quarter, helped by food inflation, strong demand for consumer electronics and a move to put labor back in stores to address long checkout lines and better stock shelves.Wal-Mart said it planned to hire 60,000 additional workers for the holidays, up 10 percent from last year, and would aim to have all of its cash registers open during peak hours.

Cott's shares jumped more than 16 percent on Thursday after the company said it would pay $1.25 billion for DSS Group Inc, parent of DS Services of America Inc.Cott said acquiring the owner of bottled water brands such as Alhambra and Belmont Springs would help it expand margins and reduce its dependency on its private-label products such as Vess soft drinks and Red Rain energy drinks, which now account for about two-thirds of sales.DS Services, whose website is water.com, operates over 2,100 routes reaching about 1.5 million customers directly in their homes and offices, which Cott said would not only increase its client base, but also help it sell its own array of products. ""This is a new customer channel in which Cott will be able to take advantage of DS Services' extensive route track infrastructure to cross sell elements of Cott's product portfolio direct to DS Services customers,"" Cott's Chief Executive Jerry Fowden said on a call.Cott, which has posted falling sales for 11 straight quarters, said DS Services would boost its revenue growth by 2-3 percent per year and add to its adjusted free cash flow per share.The company expects the deal to reduce its private label business to 49 percent of total sales from 74 percent, with water now accounting for about a third of sales. Cott posted 2013 sales of $2.1 billion, with Wal-Mart Stores Inc accounting for about 30 percent of that.After the deal, carbonated soft drink is expected make up about 19 percent of Cott's products portfolio, down from 30 percent. The water delivery business will make up more than a quarter of its products offering.Cott said the combined company's gross margins for the twelve months ended September was 27 percent, compared with 12 percent on a standalone basis. It expects cost and revenue synergies of about $25 million a year by the end of 2017.The value of the deal, expected to close by January, includes the assumption of DS Services' debt and the issuance of preferred shares to Crestview Partners and other shareholders.Credit Suisse is Cott's financial adviser, while Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP is its legal adviser. Barclays is DSS's financial adviser and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP is its legal advisor.Cott shares were up 11.3 percent at C$7.69 in afternoon trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

298,"   By Matthew Miller | BEIJING  BEIJING Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) is focusing on food safety as the world's largest retailer aims to boost profitability of its more than 400 stores in China, Wal-Mart Asia chief executive Scott Price told Reuters.Food safety is a highly emotive issue in China where there have been numerous scandals from photos of food oil being scooped from drains to tales of phoney eggs and melamine-tainted milk powder.""We play an important role in China delivering food safety and quality products to our customers,"" Price said on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) CEO Summit, which begins on Sunday. ""It's a differentiator.""Wal-Mart came under fire in Chinese media earlier in the year after a supplier's donkey meat product was found to contain fox meat.In 2011 Chinese authorities accused Wal-Mart of selling expired duck meat, and it was forced to shut down stores in Chongqing after they were accused of labelling non-organic pork as organic and selling it at a higher price.Price was named on Tuesday the head of the retailer's Asia Pacific business, in a move aimed at reviving Wal-Mart's slowing growth amid stiff competition in the region. In Japan, the company said in October it would close 30 underperforming stores to scale back.  In India, Wal-Mart last year ended a six-year partnership with Bharti Enterprises Pvt and started to run wholesale stores instead of its common retail ones. In China, Price said Wal-Mart has experienced ""a few bumps along the road"". China was the only market of Wal-Mart's five largest ones that saw falling same-store sales in the second quarter, down 1.6 percent from the year-earlier period.In Wal-Mart's global markets, Wal-Mart reported for the six months ended July 31, pre-tax income outside the U.S. down three percent to $11.83 billion from a year-earlier, according to the company's filings. In October, Wal-Mart lowered its earnings forecast for this fiscal year, blaming a tough economy for the company's low-income customers. The retailer said to expect annual sales to grow in the range of two to three percent, two percentage points down from its earlier guidance. Price said the company would ""continue to invest very aggressively"" with a focus on food quality and safety to push up traffic to Wal-Mart's Chinese stores. Wal-Mart said in June it would increase its spending on food safety in China to 300 million yuan ($49 million) in 2013, 2014 and 2015, up from a previously-announced 100 million yuan.""The 'fresh' experience is an area where we can differentiate. We are the only retailer in China that has 100 percent of our 'fresh' going through distribution centres,"" he said. ""China is a big part of the future game,"" Price added. Last year in October, Wal-Mart announced plans to open up to 110 new facilities in China between 2014 and 2016.Price will continue to help run strategy and international development as an executive vice president based in Bentonville, Arkansas. He had held the role for five years until June when returning to the U.S. to run the company's global strategy.Wal-Mart will report its third quarter earnings on Nov. 13.(The story deletes ""very"" from quote in para 3, fixes quote in para 9.)

299,"   By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Traders placed bullish bets on Wal-Mart Stores Inc's options on Tuesday, the third trading day in a row, amid rumors that the retailer could face activist pressure to spin off its Sam’s Club division.Activity in Wal-Mart's call options soared, with the combined call volume Friday through Tuesday rising to 145,000 contracts, making it the busiest three consecutive days for the calls this year, according to Trade Alert data.The call activity, especially on Friday and Monday, was driven by unconfirmed chatter that activists were pushing Wal-Mart to spin off its Sam's Club warehouse division, said Fred Ruffy, options strategist at WhatsTrading.com. The action comes ahead of Thursday's earnings reports. Earnings reports are often catalysts for heavy action in options as well.A spokesman for Wal-Mart said the company does not speculate on rumors.  A bulk of the options activity from Friday through Tuesday, was in calls - which give the buyer the right to buy the underlying share at the strike price and are typically a sign of bullish market sentiment. Calls at the $82.50 strike set to expire on Jan. 17 the most popular.Wal-Mart calls at the $80 and $77.50 strikes, expiring on Nov. 22, and others at the $80 strike, expiring on Dec. 20, were also very active over the last couple of months, OptionMetrics data showed.     Joe Kunkle, founder of options analytics firm OptionsHawk.com in Boston, said the activity is reminiscent of activist investments in other companies, such as in July 2012 when William Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management took a $2 billion stake in Procter & Gamble. The bullish action may just be from investors hoping Wal-Mart earnings benefit from the recent decline in gasoline prices, which is giving consumers more disposable income, Kunkle said.    The cost of a Wal-Mart straddle on Tuesday, in which an investor buys an at-the-money put option and a similar call option, suggests a move of about 2.2 percent in the stock in either direction by Friday. Wal-Mart stock has moved 1.8 percent on average on the day the company has reported results, Thomson Reuters data for the last eight quarters showed.Wal-Mart shares closed down slightly more than half a percent at $79.01 on Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.

306,"  Wal-Mart Stores Inc same-store sales, helped by lower gas prices, rose for the first time in seven quarters, but the world's largest retailer warned it was preparing for a bruising holiday season as it moves to match prices with online outlets.Wal-Mart said on Thursday comparable sales at stores open at least 12 months rose 0.5 percent in the third quarter ending Oct. 31, buoyed by growth in its small-format locations. The market was expecting flat same-store sales, according to Consensus Metrix. The results suggest Wal-Mart's core low-income customer, whose spending power has been limited by stagnant wages and cuts to food stamp benefits, may be loosening their purse strings, encouraged by the drop in gasoline prices below $3.""Our sense is that consumer confidence is reasonable out there and there is no doubt that lower gas prices are probably giving us a bit of benefit as well,"" Greg Foran, head of the U.S. business, told reporters.Wal-Mart shares rose 3.6 percent to $82.07 on the New York Stock Exchange.      Quarterly sales from new and existing stores rose to $119 billion from $115.7 billion, paced by demand for home goods and apparel, and 5.5 percent growth in comparable sales at Neighborhood Market outlets, the smaller format in which it is investing to counter slowing growth in Supercenters.The results compared favorably with competitor Kohl's Corp, which said its same-store sales dropped for the fifth straight quarter, hit by weak sales of women's apparel.Not all of Wal-Mart's report was positive. Customer traffic in the United States dropped 0.7 percent in the quarter, and operating income fell on higher health-care costs and investments in e-commerce. Wal-Mart lowered the top end of its full-year profit forecast to $5.02 per share from $5.15, partly citing expectations of a highly competitive holiday season.Foran said he informed managers they could match prices with Amazon.com Inc and other online retailers, formalizing a practice already in place in about half of its roughly 4,300 stores in the United States. Net profit attributable to Wal-Mart fell to $3.71 billion, or $1.15 per share, for the quarter ended Oct. 31, from $3.74 billion, or $1.14 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average expected earnings of $1.12 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.(This story was corrected as the company clarifies executive comment to show that online price matching to affect roughly 4,300 stores, not 5,000, penultimate paragraph) (Reporting by Nathan Layne in Chicago and Siddharth Cavale in Bangalore; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Alan Crosby)",2014-11-13,WMT,"Thu Nov 13, 2014 | 4:22pm EST",Wal-Mart sales rise as it girds for competitive holiday season,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-walmart-results-idUSKCN0IX1BV20141113?type=companyNews

Brent crude, which has fallen more than 30 percent since June, settled down $2.46 or 3.1 percent at $77.92 a barrel, while U.S. oil futures settled down $2.97 or 3.85 percent at $74.21.      Data from Beijing showed below-forecast factory output and investment growth at a near-13-year low, reinforcing signs that the world's second-biggest economy would have its weakest growth in almost 24 years this year.      ""Energy prices continue to be a headwind,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.     Falling energy costs, while a positive for consumers, have raised concerns about profits of major oil companies and their capital spending, analysts said.     Encouraging sales results from Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, offset weakness in the energy sector on Wall Street along with concerns that the market is overstretched.     The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 40.59 points, or 0.23 percent, to 17,652.79, the S&P 500 ended up 1.08 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,039.33 and the Nasdaq Composite finished 5.01 points, or 0.11 percent higher, at 4,680.14.      Top European shares closed up 0.2 percent at 1,346.56, reversing an earlier decline driven by a 1.7 percent drop in an index of regional oil and gas shares.       Earlier, Tokyo's Nikkei index raced to fresh seven-year highs after Jiji news agency reported Prime Minister Shinzo Abe appears to have decided to call an early election amid mounting expectations he would postpone a planned sales tax hike.             Speculation about a snap election in Japan pulled the yen toward a recent seven-year low against the dollar before the greenback briefly retreated on a bigger-than-expected rise in weekly U.S. jobless claims. The dollar was last up 0.2 percent at 115.77 yen.     The dollar was mixed against other major currencies. The euro gained 0.3 percent at $1.2477, while sterling  hit a 14-month low at $1.5694.       The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasuries  slipped 1.5 basis points to 2.35 percent.     Safe-haven gold rose 0.08 percent to $1,161.18 an ounce , holding above Friday's 4-1/2-year low of $1,131.85.

The market was expecting flat same-store sales, according to Consensus Metrix.The results suggest Wal-Mart's core low-income customer, whose spending power has been limited by stagnant wages and cuts to food stamp benefits, may be loosening their purse strings, encouraged by the drop in gasoline prices below $3.""Our sense is that consumer confidence is reasonable out there and there is no doubt that lower gas prices are probably giving us a bit of benefit as well,"" Greg Foran, head of the U.S. business, told reporters. Wal-Mart shares rose 3.6 percent to $82.07 on the New York Stock Exchange.Quarterly sales from new and existing stores rose to $119 billion from $115.7 billion, paced by demand for home goods and apparel, and 5.5 percent growth in comparable sales at Neighborhood Market outlets, the smaller format in which it is investing to counter slowing growth in Supercenters. The results compared favorably with competitor Kohl's Corp , which said its same-store sales dropped for the fifth straight quarter, hit by weak sales of women's apparel.Not all of Wal-Mart's report was positive. Customer traffic in the United States dropped 0.7 percent in the quarter, and operating income fell on higher health-care costs and investments in e-commerce. Wal-Mart lowered the top end of its full-year profit forecast to $5.02 per share from $5.15, partly citing expectations of a highly competitive holiday season.Foran said he informed managers they could match prices with Amazon.com Inc and other online retailers, formalizing a practice already in place in about half of its roughly 4,300 stores in the United States.Net profit attributable to Wal-Mart fell to $3.71 billion, or $1.15 per share, for the quarter ended Oct. 31, from $3.74 billion, or $1.14 per share, a year earlier.

Data from Beijing showed below-forecast factory output and investment growth at a near-13-year low, reinforcing signs that the world's second-biggest economy would have its weakest growth in almost 24 years this year.      Brent crude has fallen more than 30 percent since June.      Falling energy costs, while a positive for consumers, have raised concerns about profits of major oil companies and their capital spending, analysts said.     ""Eighty dollars is the pain threshold,"" said Alexandre Baradez, chief market analyst at IG France.     Brent crude was last down $2.02 or 2.51 percent at $78.36 a barrel, while U.S. oil futures fell $1.88 or 2.44 percent to $75.30.

Encouraging sales results from Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, offset weakness in the energy sector on Wall Street and some concerns the market is overstretched.     In midday trading, the Dow Jones industrial average  dipped 3.14 points, or 0.02 percent, to 17,609.06, the S&P 500  was down 4.74 points, or 0.23 percent, to 2,033.51 and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 1.78 points, or 0.04 percent, to 4,673.35.

A new ""Fair Food"" label to help shoppers identify tomatoes grown under ethical working conditions is expected to debut as soon as this weekend at Whole Foods Market, a result of efforts to ensure Florida farmworkers' rights to water, shade and fair wages.The label, featuring a worker hoisting a brimming bucket, publicizes a campaign to reform an industry criticized by labor groups and prosecutors for unsafe and unfair working conditions.A dozen major buyers, including Wal-Mart, Yum Brands, and Subway restaurants, are participating. It is not yet known when the label may be available at all outlets.Participating buyers have agreed to purchase fresh tomatoes only from growers following higher standards. About 90 percent of tomato growers have signed on in Florida, the nation's leading producer of fresh market tomatoes. The campaign's centerpiece is a premium of an extra penny per pound picked, paid on top of workers' hourly minimum wages. Since 2011, this has netted an extra $15 million for workers, organizers said, adding $30 to $80 or more to weekly paychecks.The label is ""potentially game-changing like few things are,"" said Janice Fine, an associate professor in labor studies and employment relations at Rutgers University in New Jersey.Officials at the White House and the United Nations have called the program a model that could expand to other regions and crops. The campaign is profiled in the film ""Food Chains,"" set for national release later this month. In Florida, the program has assured safe conditions for an estimated 60,000 to 90,000 workers during tomato season, mostly in the central and southern parts of the state.Florida fields produced $456 million in fresh market tomatoes in 2013, according to the state and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It's a market that Florida dominates, along with California, the nation's top overall tomato producer.  Whole Foods will debut ""Fair Food"" signage in its produce aisle as early-season cherry and grape tomatoes from participating growers arrive at its stores in the U.S. Southeast.With the label, consumers can start ""supporting directly those companies who are willing to step up their game,"" said Gerardo Reyes, a staff member of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, which launched the Fair Food Program in 2011.

The crash killed comedian James McNair.Morgan's attorney, Benedict Morelli, said Morgan was left with a traumatic brain injury and several broken bones, the Times of Trenton reported. Three other passengers were injured.""We are hoping and praying to get him back to the way he was,"" Morelli said outside federal court in Trenton, New Jersey. ""But the jury's out."" Morelli said Morgan had been using a wheelchair while undergoing therapy at home, the newspaper said.Morgan and the surviving passengers are suing Wal-Mart over the accident. Attorneys for Morgan and Wal-Mart were in court to schedule dates in the civil case. Morgan and other passengers allege that Wal-Mart knew or should have known its truck driver, Kevin Roper, had been awake for more than 24 hours before the crash, which meant under the law he should not have been on the road.Wal-Mart has argued the injuries suffered by the survivors were caused wholly or in part by their failure to wear seat belts. Roper has been charged with vehicular homicide and assault by auto and pleaded not guilty.

333,"  (Follow the author at twitter.com/bethpinsker)By Beth PinskerNEW YORK Nov 25 You might need two carts to walk away with what may be this year's biggest Black Friday bargain (at least by size): a 65"" Vizio television at Walmart  for $648.As exciting as Beats headphones and iPads are, it is giant, cheap TVs that get people to camp outside for days or brave surging crowds for ""doorbusters"" on Thanksgiving Day and the busy shopping day after known as Black Friday. Experts say this year's TVs on sale are bigger and cheaper than ever before, and they expect eager shoppers to snap them up in higher numbers than the last few years.Unit sales are already up this year so far, says Stephen Baker, vice president for industry analysis at NPD Group, which tracks TV sales. Baker expects holiday sales to be robust, after several years of unimpressive growth.The drivers of this year's TV frenzy are mostly above 40"", whereas the last few years, the best deals were on 32"" sets.""There are now 40"" to 55"" sets in the $200 price range, which is unbelievable,"" says Paul Gagnon, director of global TV research for DisplaySearch. ""People say 'Dang it, it's half the price I paid for a 32"" five years ago.""A 40"" Element flat-screen for a mere $119 graces the front of Target's Black Friday ad booklet. Best Buy is featuring a 50"" Panasonic  for $199.99. Even Kohl's , primarily a clothing and home goods retailer, has a TV on the front of its circular - albeit a 32"" model - for just $99.99. Replacement cycles are still shortening for TVs, now at less than seven years in the United States, according to NPD, but holiday shoppers are mostly shufflers, who jump at an opportunity to snag a bigger TV for their main space and move smaller ones off to bedrooms.While a TV might function for 10 years, ""it will probably be outdated within a year,"" says Louis Ramirez, a senior feature writer for dealnews.com (dealnews.com).BEHIND THE BOOM  Gagnon sees this year's sales bump as a little bit of pent-up demand now that the economy has improved, but he doesn't think the growth will be sustained. Once shoppers upgrade, they'll be set for a while.This is partly because cordcutters and device-shifters abound. These are people like Julia Scott, a 36-year-old retail deals blogger (bargainbabe.com) in Rhode Island who just ditched her television completely because she didn't want it ruling her home as her two young children grow up.Ramirez of dealnews says video game players should more than make up for cord-cutters: ""Gamers are a huge crowd, and these are people paying $400 for a console, so they will pay $900 for a new TV to match it."" This year's extra features include sets with smart TV apps built in - meaning that the TV connects to wi-fi networks and can connect seamlessly to streaming services like Netflix , Hulu and Amazon.There's also 4K - which refers to a resolution that is much higher than the current HD standard of 1080p. Some models also feature curved screens.Most shoppers dismiss all of these elements in favor of price and size, though. ""Screen size is the most important factor in the U.S.,"" says DisplaySearch's Gagnon.That often leaves people not really considering whether they are truly getting a good deal or what the quality of the item is, says Matthew Ong, a senior retail analyst for Nerdwallet.com (nerdwallet.com).Many retailers show a sale price and a ""regular"" price, noting a huge percentage discount to entice consumers. But they could be using a false starting point for that original price, Ong says. For instance, Ong analyzed a Sears deal for a $599 55"" Samsung TV with the original price listed as $1,199, but earlier in November is was selling for $807. A $200 discount is pretty good but does not sound as impressive as a $600 one.Another tip from Ong is to look carefully at the specifications of the TV on sale, because many Black Friday deals are for stripped-down knock-offs. ""They'll look similar, but they won't be as advanced,"" Ong says. The tip-off is whether you recognize the brand and if there is a model number, so you can compare prices and specifications.(Editing by Lauren Young and Cynthia Osterman)",2014-11-25,WMT,"Tue Nov 25, 2014 | 8:00am EST","YOUR MONEY-Behind Black Friday's giant, cheap TV deals",http://www.reuters.com//article/retail-holidays-blackfriday-idUSL2N0TE14N20141125?type=companyNews
334,"  (Adds details, background)Nov 25 Wal-Mart Stores Inc's chief merchandising officer, Duncan Mac Naughton, is expected to announce his departure from the world's largest retailer just days before Black Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.Mac Naughton joined the company in 2009 as chief merchandising officer of Wal-Mart Canada and moved over to the merchandising operations at the U.S. business in 2010, according to the company's website.Mac Naughton was considered a potential successor to lead Wal-Mart's U.S. business when U.S. Chief Executive Bill Simon announced his resignation in July, the Journal said.      (on.wsj.com/1vI2rtA) The company replaced Simon with Asia chief Greg Foran.

Earlier this month, Wal-Mart reported a rise in its same-store sales, first time in seven quarters, helped by lower gas prices but warned that it was preparing for a bruising holiday season as it moves to match prices with online outlets.Representatives at Walmart did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment outside regular business hours.

339,"  * CFAO plans to open first shopping center in Abidjan in H2 2015* CFAO and Carrefour teamed up in 2013 up to expand in Africa* Africa increasingly attractive destination for retailersBy Dominique VidalonPARIS, Nov 26 Africa-focused trading firm CFAO  has signed up five French brands, including soap-and-perfume retailer L'Occitane, to open stores in shopping malls which it will operate across the continent, tapping booming consumer demand.The retailers -- which also include toy seller La Grande Recre, fashion brands Cache Cache, Bonobo and Kaporal -- will have shops in the first shopping centre that CFAO plans to open in Abidjan, Ivory Coast in the second half of 2015. The mall comes under a broader partnership deal signed last year by CFAO with Carrefour, the world's second-largest retailer.Rising incomes and an underdeveloped retail sector have made Africa an important new growth destination for retailers and consumer goods companies, with the likes of Danone, Pernod Ricard and Diageo boosting investments in the region to counter weak growth in Europe. CFAO, a subsidiary of Toyota Tsusho, the Toyota Group trading arm, is Africa's biggest supplier of cars, trucks and pharmaceuticals.In May 2013 Carrefour and CFAO formed a joint venture to develop stores in Cameroon, Congo, Ivory Coast, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Ghana, Nigeria and Senegal. CFAO owns 55 percent of the venture, with Carrefour owning the rest.CFAO has said it aims to generate about 1 billion euros in revenue a year in 10 years from the link-up and from revenue generated by malls it plans to build. It eventually hopes to include 20 brands in its stable, with outlets in its shopping centres in the eight African countries targeted under the Carrefour deal. ""CFAO acts as a catalyst for the development of international brands in Africa and as a springboard for brands that view the continent as a real growth lever,"" Xavier Desjobert, Chief Executive of CFAO Retail, said.Africa's prospects for retailers were highlighted in 2011, when U.S. giant Wal-Mart bought a majority stake in South Africa's Massmart, gaining a foothold in several frontier markets.Though African per capita incomes are among the lowest in the world, a decade of robust growth and rapid population expansion have attracted international investor attention.According to research firm McKinsey & Company, the number of African households with discretionary income is projected to rise by 50 percent over the next 10 years, reaching 128 million.

Crude oil fell below $68 per barrel a day after OPEC decided not to cut output, which could leave markets oversupplied. The 7 percent decline was the biggest one-day drop since May 2011, with prices lowest since 2010.""Crude seems to have no floor right now, and we could easily see the price drop into the low $60s,"" said Tony Roth, chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust in Wilmington, Delaware.The Energy Select Sector SPDR exchange-traded fund  fell 6.4 percent to $79.82 while the S&P energy index  lost 6.3 percent, extending its run as the worst-performing S&P industry group of the year. Exxon Mobil Corp lost 4.2 percent to $90.54 while Chevron Corp fell 5.4 percent to $108.87; both are Dow components.Shale energy companies saw outsized declines, as $70 oil is considered the level at which shale becomes an unprofitable alternative. Denbury Resources, QEP Resources  and Newfield Exploration all lost more than 15 percent. Oil weakness boosted airlines, which are inversely correlated to oil prices. Southwest Airlines rose 6.5 percent to $41.82 as the S&P 500's biggest percentage gainer, followed by Delta Air Lines, up 5.5 percent to $46.67.Retailers rallied as lower gas prices could increase consumer spending.

350,"  Wal-Mart Stores Inc promoted Judith Mckenna, a 20-year company veteran, to the post of chief operating officer in the retailer's latest reshuffling of senior management under U.S. chief Greg Foran.The move comes on the heels of last month's departure of the U.S. merchandising chief and a shuffling of other key roles in the United States, where the retailer is attempting to build on a nascent recovery following a nearly two-year slump.The promotion of McKenna is part of a ""changing of the guard"" under Foran, who assumed the top U.S. post in August and is under pressure to show results, said Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough.""It's not like their business has been good and they've been lighting the world on fire,"" he said.McKenna will continue to oversee growth of its small format stores and the integration of e-commerce and store operations, two important tasks that were already under her purview as chief development officer, Wal-Mart said in a release. McKenna will succeed Gisel Ruiz, who will become executive vice president of the company's international people division, where she will oversee human resources overseas. The changes are effective immediately, Wal-Mart said.  As COO, McKenna will be in charge of the day-to-day operations of Wal-Mart's 4,300 stores in the United States and its 1.3 million employees. She will continue to report to Foran. In past roles McKenna oversaw strategy and development in Wal-Mart's international division and was COO of the British-based Asda Stores, one of the retailer's largest overseas subsidiaries.The changes are occurring in the middle of the key holiday shopping season and with Wal-Mart hoping to build on its performance last quarter ended Oct. 31, when it posted its first growth in same-store sales since 2012. Foran has indicated he wants to make quick changes to the U.S. operations with a series of ""urgent agenda items"" that include better stocking of shelves and a bolstering of its fresh food offerings.Last month Wal-Mart announced that its chief merchandising officer, Duncan Mac Naughton, was leaving the company.

351,"  (Adds details on new COO, analyst comment, context on recent management changes)Dec 10 Wal-Mart Stores Inc promoted Judith Mckenna, a 20-year company veteran, to the post of chief operating officer in the retailer's latest reshuffling of senior management under U.S. chief Greg Foran.The move comes on the heels of last month's departure of the U.S. merchandising chief and a shuffling of other key roles in the United States, where the retailer is attempting to build on a nascent recovery following a nearly two-year slump.The promotion of McKenna is part of a ""changing of the guard"" under Foran, who assumed the top U.S. post in August and is under pressure to show results, said Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough.""It's not like their business has been good and they've been lighting the world on fire,"" he said. McKenna will continue to oversee growth of its small format stores and the integration of e-commerce and store operations, two important tasks that were already under her purview as chief development officer, Wal-Mart said in a release.McKenna will succeed Gisel Ruiz, who will become executive vice president of the company's international people division, where she will oversee human resources overseas. The changes are effective immediately, Wal-Mart said. As COO, McKenna will be in charge of the day-to-day operations of Wal-Mart's 4,300 stores in the United States and its 1.3 million employees. She will continue to report to Foran.In past roles McKenna oversaw strategy and development in Wal-Mart's international division and was COO of the British-based Asda Stores, one of the retailer's largest overseas subsidiaries. The changes are occurring in the middle of the key holiday shopping season and with Wal-Mart hoping to build on its performance last quarter ended Oct. 31, when it posted its first growth in same-store sales since 2012.Foran has indicated he wants to make quick changes to the U.S. operations with a series of ""urgent agenda items"" that include better stocking of shelves and a bolstering of its fresh food offerings.Last month Wal-Mart announced that its chief merchandising officer, Duncan Mac Naughton, was leaving the company. Foran shuffled some key operational roles to coincide with Mac Naughton's departure.

Leadership changes were made and disciplinary action taken, Bracy said in the statement, without giving details.Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that Wal-Mart had used ""questionable accounting and unauthorized sales practices"" to make its retail business in China appear stronger at a time when transactions were slowing and unsold inventory was piling up. These practices included bulk sales to other retailers and temporary mark-ups of inventory, Bloomberg reported, citing internal documents and interviews with employees. (bloom.bg/1um3AjR)Bulk sales are common practice in developing markets and represent a ""modest portion"" of Wal-Mart's business in China, Bracy said in the statement.

Wal-Mart stores in China resorted to temporary mark-ups of inventory as an accounting move to prop profit without any added sales, Bloomberg reported, citing interviews with current and former Wal-Mart employees.Concerns about bulk sales, raised as far back as 2011 in an internal report, have been the subject of inquiries in China by Wal-Mart's legal team as recently as May, Bloomberg reported, citing an internal company email.

358,"   By Jason Lange | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Pessimism and doubt have dominated how Americans see the economy for many years. Now, in a hopeful sign for the economic outlook, confidence is suddenly perking up.Expectations for a better job market helped power the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment to a near eight-year high in December, according to data released on Friday.U.S. consumers also saw sharp drops in gasoline prices as a shot in the arm, and the survey added heft to strong November retail sales data that has showed Americans getting into the holiday shopping season with gusto. ""Surging expectations signal very strong consumption over the next few months,"" said Ian Shepherdson, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.While improvements in sentiment haven't always translated into similar spending growth, consumers at the very least are feeling the warmth of several months of robust hiring, including 321,000 new jobs created in November. When asked in the survey about recent economic developments, more consumers volunteered good news than bad news than in any month since 1984, said the poll's director, Richard Curtin. Moreover, half of all consumers expected the economy to avoid a recession over the next five years, the most favorable reading in a decade, Curtin said.The data bolsters the view that the U.S. economy is turning a corner and that worker wages could begin to rise more quickly, laying the groundwork for the Federal Reserve to begin hiking its benchmark interest rate to keep inflation from eventually rising above the Fed's 2 percent target. Overall, the sentiment index rose to a higher-than-expected 93.8, mirroring levels seen in boom years like 1996 and 2004.Many investors see the Fed raising rates in mid-2015, and policymakers will likely debate at a meeting next week whether to keep a pledge that borrowing costs will stay at rock bottom for a ""considerable time.""Consumers see faster inflation ahead. Over the next year, they expect a 2.9 percent increase in prices, up from 2.8 percent in November, according to the sentiment survey. Their expectations run quite counter to recent price data. The Labor Department said separately its producer price index dropped 0.2 percent last month, brought lower by falling gasoline prices. Prices were soft even excluding the drag from gasoline. U.S. stocks briefly cut losses after the buoyant sentiment data but stayed lower on the day as investors fretted about declining oil prices and what that said about global demand.

359,"   By Kim Palmer | CLEVELAND  CLEVELAND The family of an Ohio man shot and killed by police while holding a BB gun in a Walmart store filed a federal wrongful death lawsuit on Tuesday against the police and the national retail chain.John Crawford, 22, was shot after a 911 caller reported a man with a gun at the Beavercreek Walmart in a suburb of the southern Ohio city of Dayton.In a surveillance video released by authorities, Crawford, who is black, can be seen picking up an unpackaged BB gun off a shelf and walking through the store while talking on a cell phone until a white police officer shot him.Crawford's death came a few days before the Aug. 9 fatal shooting by police in Ferguson, Missouri, of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, which is being investigated by the U.S. Justice Department and has focused national attention on the use of deadly force by police.In September, a grand jury opted not to indict the two Beavercreek officers involved in the shooting. ""All we want is justice for John Crawford and everyone responsible for John Crawford’s death should be held responsible,"" Michael Wright, an attorney for the family, said in a news conference Tuesday. ""The criminal justice system refused to hold those accountable so the civil system must.""The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, names the city of Beavercreek; Sean Williams, the officer who shot Crawford; Sergeant David Darkow, who accompanied Williams; Police Chief Dennis Evers; and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.The suit said Williams shot Crawford about one second after making contact with him. The Crawford case has been compared to the more recent case of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old Cleveland boy, who was carrying a pellet gun when he was shot dead within two seconds of police arriving.Wright said that other stores, including other Walmarts, package BB guns with security devices that make the packaging difficult to open. Lawyers said the gun in the Crawford case was unboxed and had been lying on a shelf for at least two days. ""Customers are not supposed to be shot on sight when shopping at Walmart,"" said Richard Schulte, another attorney for the Crawford family.Wal-Mart spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan said store officials had not yet received the suit, which demands more than $75,000 in damages, and could not comment.Beavercreek city attorney Steve McHugh was not available for comment on Tuesday.

In Fitch's  opinion, the size of the acquired operations is moderate, given that Banco  Wal-Mart's assets and loans account for only 3.0% and 2.9%, respectively, of  BInbursa's consolidated figures. The terms of the acquisition are also consistent with BInbursa's credit profile.  The acquisition price of 1.7x equity is reasonable and will not materially alter  BInbursa's credit fundamentals. Based on the latest figures of Banco Wal-Mart  (October 2014), the price offer will account for only 5.3% of BInbursa's equity  base and 5.6% of its liquid assets. These figures are low in Fitch's opinion and  explain why the agency believes there will be no material impact on the ratings  from the announced transaction, particularly in view of BInbursa's sound capital  adequacy metrics, which are among its key credit strengths. Fitch considers the  impact of the acquired assets and associated goodwill on BInbursa's capital  metrics to be low.  Fitch believes that any potential impact on profitability, if any, would be  minor, given BInbursa's strong earnings and revenue base.  Moreover, the mild effect on BInbursa's financial profile is offset with the  strategic benefits of the transaction. This acquisition, when completed, will  enhance BInbursa's footprint in the retail financing sector, which is a  cornerstone of its medium-term strategic objectives. The transaction will also  provide some business, product, and customer diversification. Contact: Primary Analyst Alejandro Garcia, CFA Senior Director +52 81 8399 9146 Fitch Mexico SA de CV Prol.

368,"   By Nathan Layne | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Minimum wage increases across the United States will prompt Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) to adjust base salaries at 1,434 stores, impacting about a third of its U.S. locations, according to an internal memo reviewed by Reuters.The memo, which was sent to store managers earlier this month, offers insight into the impact of minimum wage hikes in 21 states due to come into effect on or around Jan. 1, 2015. These are adjustments that Wal-Mart and other employers have to make each year, but growing attention to the issue has expanded the scope of the change. Thirteen U.S. states lifted the minimum wage in 2014, up from 10 in 2013 and 8 in 2012.    Wal-Mart spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan said the company was making the changes to ""ensure our stores in the 21 states comply with the law."" For Wal-Mart, the biggest private employer in the United States with 1.3 million workers, minimum wage legislation is not a small thing. Its operating model is built on keeping costs under close control as it attracts consumers with low prices and operates on tight margins.  In recent years, it has been struggling to grow sales after many lower-income Americans lost jobs or income in the financial crisis. The Wal-Mart memo shows that there will be changes to its pay structure, including a narrowing of the gap in the minimum premium paid to those in higher skilled positions, such as deli associates and department supervisors, over lower grade jobs.  Wal-Mart will also combine its lowest three pay grades, which include cashiers, cart pushers and maintenance, into one base rate. The changes appear in part to be an effort to offset the anticipated upswing in labor costs, according to a manager who was implementing the changes at his store. ""Essentially that wage compression at the upper level of the hourly associate is going to help absorb that cost of the wage increase at the lower level,"" said the manager, who spoke on condition of anonymity. MORE CHANGE TO COME? Wal-Mart’s critics – including a group of its workers backed by labor unions - say the retailer pays its hourly workers too little, forcing some to seek government assistance that effectively provides the company with an indirect taxpayer subsidy. Labor groups have been calling for Wal-Mart, other retailers and fast-food chains to pay at least $15 an hour. Wal-Mart has indicated it may make more changes to its compensation structure in 2015. Chief Executive Doug McMillon recently said the company would improve opportunities for workers, including getting the roughly 6,000 people who make the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour at its stores off that rate. ""In the world there is a debate over inequity, and sometimes we get caught up in that,"" he told TV presenter Charlie Rose in an interview this month. McMillon said he would take steps to ensure the company is ""a meritocracy, an opportunity for people to do more."" The state minimum wage changes range from a 17 percent increase in South Dakota to $8.50 to a modest rise of 2 percent to $8.05 in Arizona. They will also impact many of Wal-Mart's big retail rivals, such as Target Corp (TGT.N), and fast-food chains like McDonald's Corp (MCD.N). A Target spokeswoman said she could not provide details on how many employees might be impacted by the changes on Jan. 1. McDonald's could not be immediately reached for comment.    Wal-Mart estimates its average full-time hourly wage is $12.92, and says that it pays competitive wages and offers its employees ample opportunity for advancement.Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said it is tough to estimate the cost impact of the minimum wage changes without knowing the number of Wal-Mart employees affected. While many employees might start out at the minimum rate, they advance to higher pay rates over time, he noted. Wal-Mart said last month that investment in wages and higher health care costs drove a 3.5 percent increase in operating expenses in its most recent quarter. Wal-Mart is unlikely to cut staff or reduce hours to keep those costs in check, given that it has made a renewed push to improve service in its stores, Yarbrough said.

370,"  Microsoft Corp's Xbox Live was back up on Friday while Sony Corp's PlayStation Network remained offline for a second day after a hacker group claimed responsibility for attacking the two Internet gaming services.Gamers on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network experienced connection problems and delays on Christmas Day, one of the busiest times of the year for the video game industry. The majority of game and console sales are generated during the end-year holiday shopping season. A message on PlayStation Network's website on Friday read: ""Under Scheduled Maintenance. We should be back online shortly. Apologies for any inconvenience."" It directed users to the PlayStation blog and other related websites. A Microsoft website that keeps track of the status of Xbox services listed Xbox Live's ""core services"" as up and running on Friday. Several third-party apps on the platform were experiencing limited services, however.  A hacking group called ""Lizard Squad"" took credit for the disruption to both Xbox Live and PlayStation Network on Thursday. The group appeared unrelated to the ""Guardians of Peace"" hackers who broke into Sony Pictures' network earlier this month to try to stop the release of the film ""The Interview,"" which depicts the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.  ""The Interview"" was released online on Wednesday on the Xbox network and other digital platforms. The movie also hit select U.S. theaters on Thursday. Lizard Squad could not be reached for comment.

371,"   By Kim Palmer  The girlfriend of a man shot dead by police while he was holding a BB gun at an Ohio Walmart has died in a car accident, a lawyer for the man's family said on Friday.Tasha Thomas, 26, who had accompanied John Crawford to the Beavercreek store where he was killed by police in August, was pronounced dead at the scene of an early morning crash on New Year's Day in Dayton, the Montgomery County coroner's office said. Another person in the car, Frederick Bailey, 30, also died.Crawford, 22, was shot after a 911 caller said a man was pointing a gun at people in a Walmart aisle in the Dayton suburb.Crawford’s death came just days before the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown by police in Ferguson, Missouri, which spurred months of protests against the use of deadly force by police. Crawford and Brown were both black, and the officers who shot them are white. In both cases, grand juries decided not to indict the officers.Surveillance video released by authorities showed that Crawford had picked up an unpackaged BB gun off a shelf and walked through the store while talking on a cell phone before police arrived and shot him. Crawford's family last month filed a federal wrongful death lawsuit against Walmart, the city of Beavercreek and the officers involved.Thomas was questioned by police for more than 90 minutes after Crawford was shot, according to video released by the Ohio Attorney General's office. Police told Thomas that Crawford was dead near the end of the interview. Michael Wright, an attorney for the Crawford family, called  Thomas’s death “tragic"" in an e-mail. A spokeswoman for the family said she was not sure what impact Thomas’s death would have on the lawsuit.

374,"   By Lehar Maan and Anya George Tharakan | BENGALURU  BENGALURU Shares in software services exporter Infosys Ltd rose almost 7 percent on Friday after it surprised investors by sticking to its full-year sales target, thanks to healthy demand that helped offset the impact of a stronger dollar.Infosys, which posted a 13 percent rise in third-quarter profit, confirmed it expects sales growth of 7 to 9 percent for the year ending in March 2015, in constant currency terms and based on exchange rates for the September quarter.Analysts said the rate at which it was adding new clients, 59 in the quarter, meant the company should hit that target.""It was quite a positive quarter for the company, in what is traditionally a lull ... That really tells us that the deal pipeline is strong. That was quite a surprise,"" said Ankita Somani, tech analyst with MSFL Research.Chief Executive Vishal Sikka was brought in last year to chart a new strategy. Under Sikka, the company, once a trendsetter for India's more than $100 billion IT outsourcing industry, has made a push for new age technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, which the CEO has said will help Infosys hit annual revenue growth rates of 15-18 percent over time.On Friday, Infosys said it was also using its workforce more efficiently, with a utilisation rate of 82.7 percent excluding trainees, its highest in 11 years.Attrition, or the number of people leaving or retiring, fell in absolute terms to 8,900 employees in the third quarter from 10,100 in the quarter before. IT companies depend on huge numbers of engineers to work on different projects. Significant departures hurt their ability to get new business.For the third quarter, the company, which provides IT services to clients including Apple Inc, Wal-mart Stores and Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), posted a quarterly profit of 32.50 billion Indian rupees ($520.9 million).Revenue in the period rose 5.9 percent to 137.96 billion rupees.

Britain's big four grocers, including Tesco, Sainsbury and Morrison as well as Asda, have lost customers to German discounters Aldi and Lidl  as well as to the more upmarket Waitrose chain and are locked in a battle for market share. Having lost out to rivals over Christmas, Morrison axed its chief executive Dalton Philips this week, emphasising the sector turmoil. Asda, which trails market leader Tesco by annual sales and vies with Sainsbury to be Britain's second-largest grocer, in November said sales at stores open more than a year, excluding petrol, fell 1.6 percent in the 13 weeks to Sept. 30, its fiscal third quarter.It is due to update investors on its trading in February.

391,"   By Reynolds Holding | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Feb 9 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Wal-Mart Stores'  gun sales are shareholders' business. The U.S. mega-retailer claims a Wall Street church's request for an arms-peddling policy is overly meddlesome. Add that to the list of excuses companies use to keep investor ideas off proxy ballots. True, lots of proposals are far out, but ones that raise issues that can affect investors deserve a vote. It's up to the Securities and Exchange Commission to define the difference.Proxy materials must generally include shareholder submissions, with at least three big exceptions. Proposals can't be misleading, conflict with management items or intrude on ordinary business. The rules weren't controversial until activist investors started inundating companies with suggestions on everything from governance to the environment.Harvard Law School's Shareholder Rights Project, for example, has cited academic studies to persuade more than 100 companies that annual board elections boost a firm's value. An SEC commissioner and other prominent critics now claim the project's shareholder proposals are misleading - and should be squelched - because they don't cite contradictory evidence.Whole Foods Market, meanwhile, ditched an investor proposition last year by ginning up a conflicting one of its own. The SEC approved the dodgy tactic in December but reversed itself last month after outraged shareholders protested. The Wal-Mart case could break new ground. In 2013, investor Trinity Church asked the retailer's board to adopt policies for selling dangerous products like the assault weapon used in the 2012 massacre at Connecticut's Sandy Hook Elementary School. With SEC consent, Wal-Mart blocked the proposal as interfering with operations. In November, though, a federal judge in Delaware ordered the measure back on the ballot, because it may ""transcendbusiness matters"" and addresses board policies, not operations. Wal-Mart has appealed.Trade groups squawk that the ruling upends SEC precedent and encourages lawsuits, and they have a point. Persistent shareholders might credibly threaten litigation if proposals advancing their narrow interests are excluded from corporate ballots. That's not an argument against Trinity's submission, which addresses an issue of national importance that directly affects Wal-Mart's reputation with customers. It is, however, reason to question the SEC. Waffling on Whole Foods and failing to define a company's ordinary business operations adds uncertainty to already complex rules. Investors and issuers deserve a lot better. CONTEXT NEWS -  Wal-Mart Stores on Feb. 13 is scheduled to file a U.S. appeals court brief arguing that a shareholder proposal intrudes on ordinary business operations and can be excluded from the company's 2015 proxy ballot. The shareholder, Trinity Church in New York, filed its brief in opposition on Feb. 4.- Trinity's proposal calls for the governance committee of Wal-Mart's board to implement policies for determining whether the company should sell guns and other products that may endanger public safety and potentially harm the company's reputation. Wal-Mart obtained the Securities and Exchange Commission's permission to exclude the proposal from the 2014 ballot.- But a federal court in November overruled the commission, ordering the proposal included in 2015 proxy materials because it involves public policy issues that transcend ordinary operations like selling products. Wal-Mart appealed the decision, and a ruling is expected in April, well before the company's annual meeting in June.   (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

400,"  (James Saft is a Reuters columnist. The opinions expressed are his own)By James SaftFeb 19 When Wal-Mart starts handing out raises it may be time to worry about equity market valuations.The U.S.'s largest retailer and biggest private employer said on Thursday it would spend more than $1 billion to hike pay for half a million workers this year. Wal-Mart will be spending some of the money to help pay for an effort to give employees more control over when and how much they work.Wal-Mart shares, you will note, duly fell 3.2 percent.I am heartily glad that Wal-Mart has raised wages and hope that wage growth is so strong that it eats into corporate margins, now at all time-highs. What I am not is convinced that all constituencies, including share owners, will benefit.There is a temptation to engage in have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too thinking here. Many good things will happen as a result of Wal-Mart hiking wages; even more if the trend gets wider traction. None of these good things will include higher stock market valuations.Wal-Mart, and other employers, have had it pretty much all their own way for decades, as wages fell in real terms despite productivity growth. Wages as a share of GDP are close to their post-World-War-Two lows while corporate profits as a share of GDP are at all-time highs. Wal-Mart specifically has been able to increase its per-employee profits by 18 percent since its 2007 reporting year. This situation, terrible for workers but great for owners, has not been missed by investors, who have bid stocks up. Even using measures which take account of cyclical changes in profits the S&P 500 is now in very rich territory, trading on an adjusted P/E multiple only surpassed twice: just before the dotcom and 1929 crashes. It is reasonable to expect this state of play won't last forever. It is also reasonable to think that as it reverses, the value of owning a given dollar of future earnings will fall.To be sure, many of the factors which have undermined bargaining power are durable and so we shouldn't be too quick to see globalization in outright reverse and the wage share of national income rocketing higher. It is also true that Wal-Mart has been under considerable political and legal pressure, which if it is the cause of the wage increase implies less of a read-across perhaps to other companies and sectors. A DURABLE RECOVERY There are good reasons to think that Wal-Mart is responding to market pressures. Hourly wages have been rising nicely. Last month's U.S. payrolls report showed an increase of 12 cents per hour, the biggest such in close to eight years. Job openings in the U.S. are at their highest since 2001 and voluntary separations are looking reasonably healthy.And Wal-Mart is not alone. Health insurer Aetna Inc  last month said it would impose a $16 per hour minimum wage floor which would affect 12 percent of its workforce, a move it said it took to reduce turnover and attract better talent.The overall picture is that labor conditions are tightening and wage growth may well continue. Whether we get back to anywhere near historical norms, both in profit margins and wage share, is impossible to say. It is certainly a long journey. Yet even if travel in this direction is slow, expect the stock market to rapidly take notice. Not only may higher wages eat into profits they may also help to make the overall valuation backdrop much less equity-market-friendly.That's because the Fed is doubtless watching. If wages rise strongly not only will one of their evident preconditions for a rate hike, a strong labor market, be at hand but we might also see a bit of inflation.Part of the point of ultra-low interest rate policy, and maintaining a huge Federal Reserve balance sheet, has been to raise valuations in asset markets. Generally the riskier the market, and equities are generally riskier than debt, the greater the impact.Of course Wal-Mart's rising tide of wages may help to lift Wal-Mart's revenue boat, not to mention that of every other business. Still Wal-Mart is only predicting a 1 percent rise in revenue in the coming year.The classic comparison, to Henry Ford's decision to pay workers enough so that they could afford cars, is perhaps not apt. Manufacturing companies as they expand have a bigger magnifying effect on their host economies than do retailers. That's why states and localities fall over each other to give inducements to get auto plants rather than big box retailers.Wal-Mart's wage move is good news, just not for equities.

406,"  * Asda sales fall for second straight quarter* Says rivals' use of vouchers hurting their profit* Says 1 bln stg price cuts pledge could be exceeded   (Recasts, adds detail, CEO comments)By James DaveyLONDON, Feb 19 Asda, the British arm of U.S. supermarket group Wal-Mart, blamed a fall in its sales on the unprecedented use of discount vouchers by its big four rivals and warned the practise  was unsustainable and damaging profits across the sector.Of Britain's big four supermarkets - market leader Tesco , Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons - Asda's market share has been the most stable over the last couple of years.But having delivered sales growth at stores open more than one year in the first two quarters of its 2014-15 financial year, they turned negative in the third quarter and on Thursday Asda posted a 2.6 percent fall in like-for-like sales over the 12 weeks to Jan. 4, its fiscal fourth quarter.Industry data last week had shown Asda as the worst performing of the leading chains over the 12 weeks to Feb. 1. That data also showed Tesco returning to sales growth for the first time since Jan. 2014 and Morrisons' best outcome since Dec. 2013. Some analysts reckon improving momentum at Tesco and Morrisons is impacting on Asda's performance.However, Asda Chief Executive Andy Clarke laid the blame for its sales decline squarely on rivals' excessive use of ""10 pounds off 40 pounds shop"" vouchers over the Christmas quarter, which he said was driving unprofitable sales for them.""There's no doubt that Q4 drove a higher level of distress in the market with a significant amount of vouchering and promotional activity, I would say unsustainable medium term activity,"" he told reporters. ""You can only give away 10 pound notes for 9 pounds for so long,"" he said, noting that eventually ""sanity takes over from vanity.""Referring to Tesco specifically, Clarke, now the longest-serving boss of a big UK supermarket after the departure of all his major rivals over the last year, said: ""I would suggest that you can only follow that approach for a short period of time or as long as your shareholders allow you to operate at a very different level of profitability.""All of Britain's big four are losing share to German discounters Aldi and Lidl and are cutting prices and improving stores and service to hold onto shoppers.Asda was the first of the big four to lower prices, saying in November 2013 it would spend 1 billion pounds ($1.54 billion)  on reductions over five years. It also stopped issuing money off vouchers over a year ago, calling them short sighted ""gimmicks"" and likening their use to the Bank of England's quantitative easing, or money printing, programme. Instead it is focusing on straightforward price cuts.Having already invested 300 million pounds in reductions in 2014, Clarke said the 1 billion pounds pledge could be exceeded.""We'll address that over time if it needs to be more than that,"" he said.Asda said on Thursday it would invest an additional 600 million pounds in 2015, opening 17 new stores, 36 petrol stations, over 150 remote click & collect sites and re-modelling 62 stores.Clarke also said the firm was in the midst of a ""brand refresh"", changing aspects of its brand to replicate parent Wal-Mart.Separately on Friday Wal-Mart reported better-than- expected fourth-quarter profit.

409,"  (Repeats story with no change to text)By Nathan LayneFeb 19 Wal-Mart Stores Inc's wage hike will likely trigger a rethink on pay across the retail and fast-food sectors, with Target Corp one of the low-wage employers facing pressure to follow suit and pay workers more.Wal-Mart announced on Thursday it would lift its minimum U.S. wage to $9 an hour this year and $10 in 2016, raising the ante in a tightening labor market where low-skilled workers easily move between retailers and fast-food chains.Labor and shareholder activists will likely use the news to ratchet up pressure on companies which have so far faced less scrutiny than Wal-Mart, the largest private U.S. employer with a workforce of 1.3 million.""This is the largest retailer out there so I think others are going to have to follow,"" said Brian Yarbrough, analyst at Edward Jones, naming Target and Staples Inc among other national retailers that may look to revise their pay scales. ""All the restaurants are going to be under pressure as well."" When Gap Inc a year ago set its minimum wage at $9 an hour and pledged to go to $10 in 2015, many workers at Wal-Mart sought to switch and secure employment at the apparel retailer, according to Burt Flickinger, managing director of Strategic Resource Group, a retail industry consultancy.Now, Wal-Mart's move should help it reduce turnover and will likely put the most direct pressure on Target, given that their pay scales for entry-level positions are generally close and there is broad overlap in product lines.""It's absolutely Target,"" Flickinger said when asked what rival would likely need to take action to retain staff. Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said the company was ""committed to offering market competitive wages that can help attract and retain great talent."" She said Target pays above the federal minimum wage of $7.25 at all of its stores, but does not disclose its average rate.Wal-Mart said the hikes would lift the average hourly wage this year for full-time employees to $13 from $12.85, while raising the average for part-time staff to $10 from $9.48. Those rates could go higher in 2016.Data from employer review site Glassdoor based on at least 75 responses shows that Target, Wal-Mart and Staples are roughly paying the same hourly rate, with cashiers and sales associates making around $9 an hour. A cashier at McDonald's Corp, by comparison, was averaging $8.44, the data shows. Staples and McDonald's did not immediately respond to requests for comment.It's not just wages. Wal-Mart also said it planned to make the scheduling of hours more predictable, taking a step towards addressing an issue that has long been a source of worker frustration.Labor groups and institutional investors have long targeted Wal-Mart on wages and now appear set to widen their scope.David Schilling, senior program director for human rights at the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, said investors would use the Wal-Mart wage hike as leverage when negotiating changes at other firms.""It's not just the retail sector. It could be fast food, restaurant workers,"" said Schilling. When it's ""a big player like Wal-Mart the ripples go forward.""

411,"   By Nathan Layne  Wal-Mart Stores Inc's wage hike will likely trigger a rethink on pay across the retail and fast-food sectors, with Target Corp one of the low-wage employers facing pressure to follow suit and pay workers more.Wal-Mart announced on Thursday it would lift its minimum U.S. wage to $9 an hour this year and $10 in 2016, raising the ante in a tightening labor market where low-skilled workers easily move between retailers and fast-food chains.Labor and shareholder activists will likely use the news to ratchet up pressure on companies which have so far faced less scrutiny than Wal-Mart, the largest private U.S. employer with a workforce of 1.3 million.   “This is the largest retailer out there so I think others are going to have to follow,” said Brian Yarbrough, analyst at Edward Jones, naming Target and Staples Inc among other national retailers that may look to revise their pay scales. ""All the restaurants are going to be under pressure as well.”When Gap Inc a year ago set its minimum wage at $9 an hour and pledged to go to $10 in 2015, many workers at Wal-Mart sought to switch and secure employment at the apparel retailer, according to Burt Flickinger, managing director of Strategic Resource Group, a retail industry consultancy.Now, Wal-Mart's move should help it reduce turnover and will likely put the most direct pressure on Target, given that their pay scales for entry-level positions are generally close and there is broad overlap in product lines. ""It's absolutely Target,"" Flickinger said when asked what rival would likely need to take action to retain staff.Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said the company was ""committed to offering market competitive wages that can help attract and retain great talent."" She said Target pays above the federal minimum wage of $7.25 at all of its stores, but does not disclose its average rate.Wal-Mart said the hikes would lift the average hourly wage this year for full-time employees to $13 from $12.85, while raising the average for part-time staff to $10 from $9.48. Those rates could go higher in 2016. Data from employer review site Glassdoor based on at least 75 responses shows that Target, Wal-Mart and Staples are roughly paying the same hourly rate, with cashiers and sales associates making around $9 an hour. A cashier at McDonald's Corp, by comparison, was averaging $8.44, the data shows.  Staples and McDonald's did not immediately respond to requests for comment.It's not just wages. Wal-Mart also said it planned to make the scheduling of hours more predictable, taking a step towards addressing an issue that has long been a source of worker frustration. Labor groups and institutional investors have long targeted Wal-Mart on wages and now appear set to widen their scope. David Schilling, senior program director for human rights at the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, said investors would use the Wal-Mart wage hike as leverage when negotiating changes at other firms.

416,"   By Nathan Layne  A prominent investor in Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) is pushing ahead with a campaign to link a portion of executive compensation to staff motivation, a sign that the retailer's wage hike last week won't end outside pressure over employee pay and benefits.Connecticut Treasurer Denise Nappier, whose office oversees $40 million worth of Wal-Mart shares in state pension and trust funds, in December submitted a proposal calling for the incentive pay of senior executives to be tied in part to a measure of ""employee engagement"", according to previously unreported filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission.Wal-Mart is fighting to keep this and other select proposals off the ballot for its annual meeting in June, filings show. Because the Walton family controls a majority of shares, outside proposals can be easily defeated even if they are put to a vote, and in any case are usually non-binding.But even a losing battle could raise pressure on the retailer, potentially leading to compromise.The proposal by Nappier, a Democrat, shows how some investors are searching for new ways to tackle social issues which they argue are key to a company's financial success. This includes the belief, shared by a growing number of investors of all political stripes, that low-wage employers have underinvested in people to the detriment of long-term returns.Some are aligned with labor groups fighting for a ""living wage"" and better conditions at retailers and fast-food chains: Connecticut's proposal is a revised version of a union-supported submission that failed to make the Wal-Mart ballot last year.In another proposal, a group of Catholic nuns is urging Wal-Mart to disclose a comparison of the pay of top executives to the median store employee wage and explain changes in the gap over time.Wal-Mart is not the only low-wage employer to face scrutiny over pay. McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) and other fast-food chains have also been the target of nationwide protests calling for the wage floor to be set at $15 an hour.Wal-Mart last week said it was raising its minimum U.S. hourly wage to $9 in April and $10 for current employees next year, compared to the federal minimum of $7.25. Wal-Mart spokesman Randy Hargrove said its $1 billion investment in wages and training would reduce turnover and improve engagement - addressing the same issue targeted in Connecticut's plan.In a statement to Reuters, Nappier commended the wage hikes as a ""step in the right direction toward investing in human capital"". She said she would urge the SEC to allow a vote on the proposal to ""ensure that Wal-Mart is committed over the long-haul on this important element of sustainable growth."" The SEC declined to comment.FLASHPOINT Lawyers for Wal-Mart argue the proposal involves ""ordinary business"" matters, a common SEC criteria for exclusion, and that it has already been implemented in other ways, citing a diversity and inclusion metric that partially determines pay in an annual incentive plan. The Connecticut proposal defines engagement as the extent to which workers are motivated to ""apply discretionary effort to accomplish organizational goals"". It calls on the compensation committee to work with outside experts to measure engagement, which would complement financial metrics in determining pay.Wal-Mart has long been a flashpoint in the debate over employee treatment. Of the roughly 350 proposals that appeared on U.S. shareholder ballots over the past decade related to human capital management, 16 were at Wal-Mart, the most of any company, data from Institutional Shareholder Services shows. The growing debate about worsening income inequality in the United States has put a spotlight on how fast-food chains and retailers treat their staff, both as a social issue and from the perspective of investment returns.""Our message to any retailer would be that employees are your front line. You need to treat your human capital as you would treat your financial capital,"" said Anne Sheehan, director of corporate governance at the California State Teachers' Retirement System, which holds nearly $400 million worth of Wal-Mart shares.Sheehan declined to comment specifically on Wal-Mart because the fund is suing current and former executives over allegations of bribery in Mexico that first surfaced in a New York Times article in 2012. Hargrove declined to comment on that matter, citing an ongoing investigation.  SEEKING MORE  With the wage hike, Wal-Mart showed it ""can stand up to the plate and be a better company,"" said Cynthia Murray, an employee, shareholder and member of the OUR Walmart labor activist group, who submitted her own proposal calling for the company to address gender-based pay inequity. ""Why should we stop at that? We need more.""Hargrove said the company had included 27 proposals over the past 6 years and only seeks to exclude those they believe don't meet SEC guidelines or involve topics better left to management or the board. ""Shareholders have varying views and they are important and we take them into consideration,"" he said.Lawyers for Wal-Mart are arguing against inclusion of six proposals in 2015, including one calling for an independent board chairman that has been on the ballot the past two years, according to letters filed with the SEC.The independent chairman proposal was supported by 15.4 percent of the vote in 2014, short of the 20 to 30 percent threshold governance experts say can generally prompt a board to seriously consider an issue or take action.But excluding the Walton block of stock, the measure got 40 percent of the ""independent"" vote, up from 36 percent in 2013. Submitted by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters General Fund, the proposal cites the allegations of bribery in Mexico as one of the factors underlining the need for improved oversight. The current board chairman is Rob Walton, scion of the billionaire family that founded the retailer. The Teamsters fund is contesting Wal-Mart's argument that the proposal should be excluded because it is vague, correspondence with the SEC shows.As examples of independent oversight, Hargrove noted that 70 percent of the board is independent, that it has an independent lead director and has long separated the roles of chairman and CEO.

420,"   By Michael Fleeman | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Heirs of the late soul singer Marvin Gaye won a $7.4 million judgment on Tuesday against recording stars Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams, who a jury found plagiarized the Motown artist in the creation of their hit single ""Blurred Lines.""The U.S. District Court jury in Los Angeles sided with Gaye's estate in the closely watched litigation, finding that parts of his 1977 hit ""Got to Give it Up"" were lifted by Thicke and Williams for their summer 2013 R&B chart-topper.The jury awarded Gaye's heirs $4 million in actual damages plus $3.4 million in profits that Thicke and Williams were found to have derived from their copyright infringement of ""Got to Give it Up.""Several other parties sued by Gaye's estate, the rapper T.I. and various record and music companies, were cleared of copyright infringement on ""Got to Give it Up."" Gaye's daughter, Nona Gaye, hugged her attorney and wept as the court clerk read the verdict capping a weeklong trial that delved into the boundaries between artistic inspiration and copyright infringement.The suit by Gaye's children cited excerpts of magazine interviews given by Thicke to support their contention he had publicly admitted to drawing on ""Got to Give it Up"" when producing and recording ""Blurred Lines."" But Thicke said later in sworn statements he was high on painkillers and alcohol when ""Blurred Lines"" became a hit and that he exaggerated his contribution to writing the song.Thicke sang the raunchy, percussive R&B dance tune, a worldwide hit that ranked as the biggest U.S. pop song of the summer of 2013, at that year's MTV Video Music Awards in a provocative performance featuring pop singer Miley Cyrus. Williams, the producer behind the song, acknowledged in court that he had been a fan of Gaye's music since childhood, but said under oath that ""Blurred Lines"" and ""Got to Give it Up"" were similar in terms of genre only.""The last thing you want to do as a creator is take something of someone else's when you love him,"" Williams testified.

421,"  March 10 A women's group has started a campaign calling on Target Corp to raise its hourly wages, as pressure builds on retailers to follow Wal-Mart Stores Inc  in boosting worker pay.UltraViolet, a group which advocates for women's issues, said it has taken out online ads in three states and started an online petition pressing Target to increase its wages. So far it has attracted nearly 25,000 signatures, the group said on Tuesday.The move comes on the heels of Wal-Mart's announcement last month that it was lifting its minimum wage to $9 an hour in April and to $10 for current employees in 2016, above the federal minimum of $7.25. The owner of apparel retailer T.J. Maxx followed with a similar announcement a few days later. Gap Inc had lifted its pay last year.""Wal-Mart, Gap and TJMaxx have done it and now it's time for Target to step up and do the same,"" said Karin Roland, organizing director at UltraViolet, which claims 600,000 members. ""A higher minimum wage is essential to women's economic security."" Roland said she believes the campaign is the first one in which a labor group is singling out Target on wages.Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder did not comment on UltraViolet specifically but said the company was committed to paying competitive wages, while noting that all workers at its roughly 1,800 stores made more than the federal minimum. ""We've got a history of being very competitive in the wages we offer our team members.

422,"  JOHANNESBURG, March 12 South African retailer Massmart named a Bharti Airtel Africa executive as its new finance head on Thursday in the latest reshuffle at the unit of Wal-Mart, now in a problematic expansion in Africa.Johannes van Lierop is replacing Ilan Zwarenstein, who advised the board last August of his intention to resign. He is the third top executive to join the team at Massmart in less than a year. Guy Hayward took over as chief executive in June last year after Grant Pattison stepped down. Kuseni Dlamini joined around the same time as chairman after founder Mark Lamberti accepted a CEO position at Imperial Holdings. Leirop joins the company in the middle of expansion into other African countries, where it has found it difficult due to a shortage of the sort of prime retail space it favours in lucrative markets such as Nigeria. Massmart is also facing tough competition at home as it rolls out its grocery business to take on industry leaders Shoprite Holdings and Pick n Pay Stores    (Reporting by Tiisetso Motsoeneng; Editing by Tom Heneghan)",2015-03-12,WMT,"Thu Mar 12, 2015 | 9:20am EDT",South Africa's Massmart taps Bharti Airtel executive as CFO,http://www.reuters.com//article/massmart-managementchanges-idUSL5N0WE3JH20150312?type=companyNews

435,"   By Nathan Layne  Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) shareholders will vote in June at the company's annual meeting on electing an independent board chairman, after U.S. regulators rejected a request by the retailer to block the proposal.Efforts the past two years were unsuccessful to unseat current board Chairman Rob Walton, scion of the billionaire family that founded the world's largest retailer. Because the Walton family controls more than 50 percent of the retailer's shares, outside proposals generally have little chance of passing.   Wal-Mart had argued that the proposal, submitted by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters General Fund, should be omitted because it was vague in its standard of independence.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rejected that argument, according to a letter from the agency delivered to the fund sponsoring the proposal on Friday. In its ruling SEC attorney Luna Bloom wrote that the proposal was not ""so inherently vague or indefinite"" that shareholders and the company would not be able to determine ""what actions or measures the proposal requires.""Wal-Mart said it respected the SEC's decision, while noting that it has over the years bolstered independent oversight, including filling its 16-person board with 11 independent members and separating the chairman and CEO roles.""Wal-Mart has always strived to maintain high corporate governance standards,"" spokesman Randy Hargrove said. The Teamsters fund has argued that a chairman without ties to the Walton family and who was independent of management would help improve oversight. It cited ongoing investigations into allegations of bribery in Mexico among the issues that illustrated the need for change.The independent chairman proposal was supported by 15.4 percent of the vote in 2014, short of the 20 percent to 30 percent threshold that governance experts say can generally prompt a board to seriously consider an issue or take action.  But excluding the Walton block of stock, the measure got 40 percent of the ""independent"" vote, up from 36 percent in 2013.Wal-Mart has sought to omit a handful of proposals this year. One calling for disclosure on pay disparity between executives and store workers was dropped by a group of Catholic nuns, SEC records show.The Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet and other co-filers said they had dropped the proposal in part because of Wal-Mart's decision in mid-February to raise its minimum wage.

437,"   By Nathan Layne  Wal-Mart Stores Inc shareholders will vote in June at the company's annual meeting on electing an independent board chairman, after U.S. regulators rejected a request by the retailer to block the proposal.Efforts the past two years were unsuccessful to unseat current board Chairman Rob Walton, scion of the billionaire family that founded the world's largest retailer.Because the Walton family controls more than 50 percent of the retailer's shares, outside proposals generally have little chance of passing.Wal-Mart had argued that the proposal, submitted by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters General Fund, should be omitted because it was vague in its standard of independence. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rejected that argument, according to a letter from the agency delivered to the fund sponsoring the proposal on Friday.In its ruling SEC attorney Luna Bloom wrote that the proposal was not ""so inherently vague or indefinite"" that shareholders and the company would not be able to determine ""what actions or measures the proposal requires.""Wal-Mart said it respected the SEC's decision, while noting that it has over the years bolstered independent oversight, including filling its 16-person board with 11 independent members and separating the chairman and CEO roles. ""Wal-Mart has always strived to maintain high corporate governance standards,"" spokesman Randy Hargrove said.The Teamsters fund has argued that a chairman without ties to the Walton family and who was independent of management would help improve oversight. It cited ongoing investigations into allegations of bribery in Mexico among the issues that illustrated the need for change. The independent chairman proposal was supported by 15.4 percent of the vote in 2014, short of the 20 percent to 30 percent threshold that governance experts say can generally prompt a board to seriously consider an issue or take action.But excluding the Walton block of stock, the measure got 40 percent of the ""independent"" vote, up from 36 percent in 2013.Wal-Mart has sought to omit a handful of proposals this year.

438,"   By Lucia Mutikani | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. consumer prices rebounded in February as gasoline prices rose for the first time since June, and there were also signs of an uptick in underlying inflation pressures, keeping the Federal Reserve on course to raise interest rates this year.The economy, which has been on the back foot in recent months, received another boost from other data on Tuesday showing new home sales surged to a seven-year high in February and manufacturing activity gained some momentum in March. The upbeat reports came despite harsh weather and a strong dollar, which have contributed to slowing economic activity early in the first quarter.""It doesn't corroborate the further disinflation story. There is some chance economic activity is going to pick up a little bit this spring, but it's not really clear how much and that matters for the timing of the first rate hike,"" said Guy Berger, an economist at RBS in Stamford, Connecticut. The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index increased 0.2 percent last month after dropping 0.7 percent in January, ending three straight months of declines in the index. In the 12 months through February, the CPI was unchanged after slipping 0.1 percent in January, as the impact of an earlier plunge in global crude oil prices lingers.Fed officials have long viewed the energy-driven weakness in prices as transitory and economists said February's firmer  readings were in line with policymakers' projections that inflation will move back to the central bank's 2 percent target.The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, while U.S. stocks edged down. Prices for U.S. Treasury debt were higher.While a June move remains on the cards, many economists are leaning towards a September tightening, arguing that the effects of a strong dollar and weak energy prices would continue to influence inflation data through the first half of the year.  Fed Chair Janet Yellen said last week policymakers could raise interest rates when they had ""seen further improvement in the labor market"" and were ""reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.""DOWNWARD PRESSURE ""In the near-term, the stronger dollar will continue to put downward pressure on imported goods prices,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. ""As the dampening effect from the stronger dollar fades in the second half of this year, we would expect to see core inflation gradually strengthen."" The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, increased 0.2 percent in February after a similar gain in January. In the 12 months through February, the core CPI rose 1.7 percent, the largest increase since November.For now, the signs of inflation are welcome for an economy that has stumbled in recent months under the weight of a harsh winter, weak global demand, the strong dollar and the now-settled labor dispute at one of the country's busiest ports.In a separate report, the Commerce Department said new home sales jumped 7.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 539,000 units last month, the highest level since February 2008.Manufacturing, which has been hurt by supply chain disruptions because of the ports labor strife, showed some strength this month. Financial information services firm Markit said its U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to a five-month high of 55.3 in March from a reading of 55.1 in February. Crude oil prices fell 60 percent between June and January on fears of a global oil glut and the refusal of Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members to cut output. In February, Brent LCOc1 stabilized at around $60 and U.S. crude at around $50.Last month, domestic gasoline prices rose 2.4 percent, the largest increase since December 2013, after tumbling 18.7 percent in January. Food prices increased 0.2 percent. Elsewhere, shelter costs increased 0.2 percent, accounting for about two-thirds of the increase in the core CPI. There were gains in the prices of apparel, airfares, new motor vehicle and used cars and trucks prices. However, the cost of medical care services declined for the first time since 1975.

442,"  * GNC starts selling herbal supplements in New York* NY AG test also confirms GNC's products meet FDA guidelines* GNC agrees to tests that exceed FDA requirements* Probe into Walgreens, Wal-Mart, Target products ongoing* GNC shares up as much as 8 pct   (Adds Walgreens response in paragraph 13, updates share price)March 30 GNC Holdings Inc said it restored certain herbal supplements to its stores in New York after reaching an agreement with the state's attorney general that its products complied with the Food and Drug Administration's guidelines.GNC also agreed to adopt testing standards for herbal supplements that exceed FDA requirements, a first in the United States, Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement. The end of a dispute that started on Feb. 2 sent the company's shares up as much as 8 percent to a 52-week high of $49.65 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.The company did not have to pay any monetary damages, just implement reforms, Elizabeth DeBold, a spokeswoman for the Attorney General's office said.GNC was one of four retailers that halted sales of certain supplements after being subpoenaed by Schneiderman as DNA tests failed to detect plant materials that the companies claimed were a part of their supplements. Both internal and independent third-party tests had proved that GNC's ""products are safe, pure, properly labeled and in full compliance with all regulatory requirements"", the company said in a statement on Monday.GNC had said earlier that tests showed its products contained all herbal extracts listed on labels, and on Monday the company said it had restarted selling its Herbal Plus products.A study commissioned by the Attorney General to determine the presence or absence of the DNA of certain plants in some herbal supplements also found GNC's products were within prescribed FDA guidelines, Schneiderman's statement said. GNC will start DNA barcoding within 18 months to confirm the authenticity of all plants used as sources for its herbal supplements prior to processing, Schneiderman said.The company would test for allergen contamination pre and post production and had also agreed to prominently disclose in its stores and on its website if a supplement product was derived from whole herbs or extracts, Schneiderman said.Herbal Plus is part of GNC's vitamins, minerals and herbal supplements business, which accounts for almost 40 percent of its U.S. retail revenue.The investigation into the supplements sold by Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Target Corp was ongoing, DeBold said.Walgreens was reviewing the matter and intends to continue cooperating with the Attorney General's office, spokesperson James Graham said.Wal-Mart and Target were not available for comment.

445,"  (Adds statements from Wal-Mart, 40 tech companies)By Steve BarnesLITTLE ROCK, Ark., April 1 Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson told lawmakers on Wednesday to revise a bill that rights activists and U.S. businesses said allowed discrimination against gays, and home-state corporate giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc  praised his action.Indiana's governor a day earlier said lawmakers should fix a similar Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). After it was enacted last week, the state was hit with protests, threatened boycotts and warnings from powerful U.S. firms of pending economic damage for being seen as standing against U.S. ideals of inclusion.In a news conference at the Capitol in Little Rock, Hutchinson, who previously said he would sign the bill, said he was sending the act back to the Republican-controlled legislature to be rewritten so it can better balance tolerance for diversity and protections of religious freedom.""We want to be known as a state that does not discriminate, but understands tolerance,"" Hutchinson said. ""We just didn't get it perfect through that legislative process.""The governor said his own son had asked him to veto it, adding a personal element to the pressure to reject the bill. While Hutchinson spoke, scores of protesters outside waved the rainbow flag of the gay rights movement.Hutchinson, who is 64, recognized a generational divide over same-sex marriage.""The issue has become divisive, because our nation remains split on how to balance the diversity of our culture with the traditions and firmly held religious convictions. It has divided families and there is clearly a generational gap on this issue."" A day earlier, Walmart, the world's biggest retailer, called on Hutchinson to veto the bill. On Wednesday, it commended his decision and, in a Twitter post, urged lawmakers to ""make certain any legislation does not encourage discrimination.""About 40 technology industry leaders, including the CEOs of Yelp, Twitter, AirBnB, Cisco Systems  and PayPal, joined the debate with a statement calling on state lawmakers to approve civil rights protections for members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community.In Indiana, Republican lawmakers met LGBT leaders to see how they could modify the new law to protect their community from potential discrimination. The rewritten law could be ready as early as Thursday, said Tory Flynn, spokeswoman for Indiana House Speaker Brian Bosma.DAMAGE CONTROL  Twenty U.S. states and the federal government have RFRAs, which allow individuals to sue the government if they believe their First Amendment religious rights have been violated.But those in Indiana and Arkansas go further than all but one of the state laws, allowing lawsuits between private parties. That raised the possibility that businesses such as florists could use the law as a defense if they are sued for refusing to provide services for same-sex weddings.Texas is the only other state with a similar provision but its law contains language that it cannot be used to undermine civil rights, legal experts said.Hutchinson said he was asking lawmakers to bring the Arkansas RFRA in line with the federal one, which does not include the language on lawsuits between private parties. ""If we fix it now, it is probably a week's worth of repairs to Arkansas' image. If we don't, it is a black eye that is going to be a long time healing, if ever,"" said Randy Zook, president and CEO of the Arkansas State Chamber of Commerce.Critics see the crafting of the bills in Arkansas and Indiana as a push-back against the expansion of gay-marriage acts to most states last year.Supporters of the Indiana and Arkansas bills argue that courts hearing religious freedom cases will ensure a balance is struck between religious freedom and anti-discrimination.Jerry Cox, president of the Arkansas Family Council, which supported the state's bill, said he was disappointed.""I fail to see why the bill needs to be amended. It's been thoroughly vetted,"" he said.While Wal-Mart has pushed for a veto, Jim Walton, one of the world's wealthiest people and a member of the Walton family who own a majority of Wal-Mart's stock, have made contributions to the Council, public records show.According to the National Institute on Money in State Politics, Walton family members have contributed $12,000 to Hutchinson and $75,000 to the Council since 2004.

450,"   By Nathan Layne | CHICAGO  CHICAGO The chief executive of Wal-Mart Stores Inc has emerged as an unlikely voice for gay rights after the Arkansas governor heeded his call on Wednesday to reject a much-criticized bill.But the decision by Doug McMillon to speak out against the ""religious freedom"" bill reflects more than a decade of evolving policy by the retailer on the issue of gay and lesbian rights, and follows a pattern of taking stands on some social issues when it makes business sense to do so.""Every day, in our stores, we see firsthand the benefits diversity and inclusion have on our associates, customers and communities we serve,"" McMillon said in a statement on Tuesday asking for a veto of the bill. That was seen as a major factor behind the governor's decision on Wednesday to ask lawmakers in Wal-Mart's home state for revisions.Wal-Mart's action comes against the backdrop of other major companies taking stands on developing political and social issues, with mixed results.General Electric Co CEO Jeff Immelt on Wednesday joined a growing chorus of executives expressing concerns about a similar bill seen as possibly discriminatory against gays in Indiana.Starbucks Corp canceled a program in which baristas were invited to engage customers on conversations about race, making it a cautionary tale for companies looking to wade into potentially controversial issues.Wal-Mart has been careful in how it tackles issues in the public domain and retains a reputation for conservatism that traces to its origins in a small Arkansas town.For years it has resisted calls by labor groups to pay a ""living wage"" and its move in February to increase pay to at least $9 an hour was viewed by many analysts as driven by competition for workers in a tight labor market as much as social concerns. Advocates of the ""living wage"" want $15 per hour. PROTECTING THE BUSINESS  One former Wal-Mart executive, who now consults for the company, saw parallels between McMillon's show of support for LGBT rights and a push a decade ago on sustainability under then-Chief Executive Lee Scott.Scott told people to find ways to use less energy and cut waste but wanted new initiatives to be profitable, the former executive said. Ultimately, the stand on LGBT rights is about protecting the business, said the former executive, who declined to be quoted because of his continuing ties to Wal-Mart.""It was the smart business thing to do,"" the consultant said, adding that McMillon's stance should help avoid the business boycotts now threatening Indiana. ""But it was also the right thing to do for the associates culturally."" Standing by while its home state was labeled anti-gay could have hindered Wal-Mart’s ability to recruit executives as well as hurt its image generally, argued Deena Fidas, a director at the Human Rights Campaign, which rates companies on their policies toward lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender workers. ""It comes down to the issue of economics here. No one wants the stain of discrimination on their headquarters state,"" she said. ""In many ways their story is one of leading in some cases and in other cases following industry peers and the trends of the Fortune 500 broadly."" Wal-Mart made its first big step on LGBT policy in 2003 when it added sexual orientation to its equal employment policy. An internal support group, Walmart PRIDE (Promoting Respect, Inclusion, Diversity & Equity) was formed the following year.But a few years later it pulled its support for the National Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce after conservative groups threatened to boycott its stores, drawing criticism from LGBT groups and illustrating tension over the issue within the company. CHANGING ATTITUDES Wal-Mart's shift in stance in many ways reflects changing attitudes in the United States overall. A majority of Americans has supported same-sex marriage for several years, although a substantial minority still opposes it, according to Gallup polls.While some shoppers have taken to social media to criticize Wal-Mart's stance on the Arkansas bill, many have voiced support and there has been no sign of protest or any other impact on Wal-Mart stores.In 2011 Wal-Mart added gender identity to its nondiscrimination policy and in 2013 announced it would extend benefits to same-sex partners. On the back of those moves the retailer scored 90 out of 100 in the HRC's latest Corporate Equality Index.""Wal-Mart has had a vision of where they want to take their LGBT policies over the last decade before we even got in the picture,"" said Jordan Garcia of the Northwest Arkansas Center for Equality, which was founded on a grant from Wal-Mart in 2006.""It was just a matter of when was the right time and the right leadership in place.""

451,"   By Karen Freifeld | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A group of 14 state attorneys general on Thursday asked the U.S. Congress to investigate the herbal supplements industry after a New York probe of the products turned up ingredients that were not listed on labels and raised safety concerns.The group, led by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and Illinois Attorney General Greg Zoeller, also asked Congress to consider giving the U.S. Food and Drug Administration more oversight of herbal supplements.""We believe the safety and efficacy of these supplements is a matter of deep public concern across the country,"" the attorneys general said in the letter, urging ""swift action.""In February, four major retailers, GNC Holdings Inc, Target Corp, Walgreens and Wal Mart Stores Inc, halted sales of certain supplements after being subpoenaed by the New York attorney general. DNA tests had failed to detect plant materials listed on the majority of products tested. On Monday, GNC reached an agreement with Schneiderman to adopt more stringent testing standards than the FDA requires, and began to resell the supplements.A study found the products were within FDA guidelines, Schneiderman said. GNC said tests also showed its products were safe, pure, properly labeled and in full compliance.The attorneys general sent their letter requesting a probe to Kansas Senator Jerry Moran and Pennsylvania Representative Joe Pitts, chairmen of subcommittees on product safety and health. They cited the New York probe and said researchers also have found other problems, including high levels of lead, mercury and arsenic in certain supplements.  The letter was signed by attorneys general from Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New York, Northern Mariana Islands, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island.The attorneys general asked the subcommittees to work with the FDA to see whether the agency should develop enhanced quality assurance programs and other safety requirements. Currently, the FDA regulates dietary supplements under a different set of rules than those covering drug products.

452,"   By Karen Freifeld | NEW YORK, April 2  NEW YORK, April 2 A group of 14 state attorneys general on Thursday asked the U.S. Congress to investigate the herbal supplements industry after a New York probe of the products turned up ingredients that were not listed on labels and raised safety concerns.The group, led by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and Illinois Attorney General Greg Zoeller, also asked Congress to consider giving the U.S. Food and Drug Administration more oversight of herbal supplements.""We believe the safety and efficacy of these supplements is a matter of deep public concern across the country,"" the attorneys general said in the letter, urging ""swift action.""In February, four major retailers, GNC Holdings Inc, Target Corp, Walgreens and Wal Mart Stores Inc , halted sales of certain supplements after being subpoenaed by the New York attorney general. DNA tests had failed to detect plant materials listed on the majority of products tested. On Monday, GNC reached an agreement with Schneiderman to adopt more stringent testing standards than the FDA requires, and began to resell the supplements.A study found the products were within FDA guidelines, Schneiderman said. GNC said tests also showed its products were safe, pure, properly labeled and in full compliance. The attorneys general sent their letter requesting a probe to Kansas Senator Jerry Moran and Pennsylvania Representative Joe Pitts, chairmen of subcommittees on product safety and health. They cited the New York probe and said researchers also have found other problems, including high levels of lead, mercury and arsenic in certain supplements.The letter was signed by attorneys general from Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New York, Northern Mariana Islands, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. The attorneys general asked the subcommittees to work with the FDA to see whether the agency should develop enhanced quality assurance programs and other safety requirements. Currently, the FDA regulates dietary supplements under a different set of rules than those covering drug products.Steve Mister, president of the Council for Responsible Nutrition, an industry group, said the New York attorney general's investigation was discredited and concerns about ""alleged widespread safety issues are not true.""He said ""the industry is already amply regulated on a federal level.""

453,"   By Steve Barnes | LITTLE ROCK, Ark.  LITTLE ROCK, Ark. Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson told lawmakers on Wednesday to revise a bill that rights activists and U.S. businesses said allowed discrimination against gays, and home-state corporate giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc  praised his action.The state's Senate took up the challenge late on Wednesday, sending to the House of Representatives legislation that would bring the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) into line with federal statutes. A House panel is due to take up that law on Thursday.Indiana's governor a day earlier said lawmakers should fix a similar RFRA. After it was enacted last week, the state was hit with protests, threatened boycotts and warnings from powerful U.S. firms of pending economic damage for being seen as standing against U.S. ideals of inclusion.In a news conference at the Capitol in Little Rock, Hutchinson, who previously said he would sign the bill, said he was sending the act back to the Republican-controlled legislature to be rewritten so it can better balance tolerance for diversity and protections of religious freedom.""We want to be known as a state that does not discriminate, but understands tolerance,"" Hutchinson said. ""We just didn't get it perfect through that legislative process.""The governor said his own son had asked him to veto it, adding a personal element to the pressure to reject the bill. While Hutchinson spoke, scores of protesters outside waved the rainbow flag of the gay rights movement.Hutchinson, who is 64, recognized a generational divide over same-sex marriage.""The issue has become divisive, because our nation remains split on how to balance the diversity of our culture with the traditions and firmly held religious convictions. It has divided families and there is clearly a generational gap on this issue."" A day earlier, Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, called on Hutchinson to veto the bill. On Wednesday, it commended his decision and, in a Twitter post, urged lawmakers to ""make certain any legislation does not encourage discrimination.""About 40 technology industry leaders, including the CEOs of Yelp, Twitter, AirBnB, Cisco Systems  and PayPal, joined the debate with a statement calling on state lawmakers to approve civil rights protections for members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community.In Indiana, Republican lawmakers met LGBT leaders to see how they could modify the new law to protect their community from potential discrimination.

465,"   By Nathan Layne  Wal-Mart Stores Inc said on Friday it would eliminate the position of zone manager in its U.S. stores while adding up to 8,000 new department heads as part of an overhaul of its store operations.There are about five zone managers in each of Wal-Mart's 3,407 supercenters, and those employees will be reassigned to department manager or assistant manager positions, spokesman Kory Lundberg said.In addition, Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, plans to add 7,000 to 8,000 department manager positions, Lundberg said. The cost of doing so is included in the $1 billion investment in wages and staffing outlined in February, he said.

In switching to other manager roles in the store they will be paid at least what they make now or more, Lundgren said.

471,"   By Michael Fleeman and Nathan Layne | PICO RIVERA, California/CHICAGO  PICO RIVERA, California/CHICAGO A union on Monday asked the National Labor Relations Board to force Wal-Mart to reinstate employees at five stores, accusing the retailer of closing the locations to retaliate against workers for attempts to organize for better pay and benefits.Wal-Mart Stores, which announced last week that it was temporarily closing five stores in Texas, Oklahoma, Florida and California to fix plumbing issues, denied the union's claims. It said it would work to reopen the stores, which employed about 2,200 people, as quickly as possible.""We don't believe there is any basis for an injunction,"" the retailer said in a statement. In a complaint to the National Labor Relations Board, the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union said Wal-Mart closed a store in Pico Rivera, California, because it has been a center of worker activism, including having the first U.S. strike in 2012. It claimed Wal-Mart shut down the other four stores as cover for the move.The UFCW is seeking injunctive relief to have the employees   reinstated or transferred to other stores without loss of pay.About 200 Wal-Mart workers and supporters rallied outside the Pico Rivera store on Monday, some carrying signs reading ""Hey Wal-Mart the plumbing excuse stinks."" A representative for the local Democratic congresswoman, Linda Sanchez, read a statement expressing concern about its ""abrupt closing.""Claims to the NLRB are first investigated by a regional director. If a claim is determined to have merit, NLRB counsel may seek an injunction with a federal court while the case moves to an NLRB administrative judge. The judge's decision can be appealed to the NLRB's five-member board. However, most cases are settled without formal litigation. The process can take several months, meaning employees may need to seek work elsewhere before the outcome of the complaint is clear. Wal-Mart said it is offering workers 60 days' pay and opportunities to transfer to other stores.""Soon, I won't know where I'll get my next paycheck,"" said Venanzi Luna, 36, a deli manager and member of OUR Walmart, the UFCW-backed worker group behind recent protests at the store.Karen Boroff, a professor of management at Seton Hall University, said Wal-Mart would likely have extensive documentation on the repair issues, which could be used to counter the union's claims. Wal-Mart will need to show the problem is significant at all five stores. ""It can't be trivial,"" she said. ""If they can show that, then you have a real fact pattern in its favor.""Wal-Mart said each of the five locations had more than 100 plumbing problems over the last two years, the most among its 5,000-plus U.S. stores. It provided a list of issues at Pico Rivera, including clogged drains with water flowing onto the sales floor, and said the local health regulator downgraded the deli department in January as a result of the problems.Wal-Mart recently hiked its minimum hourly wage to at least $9 an hour nationally as part of a $1 billion investment in better pay and benefits for its employees.

475,"   By Sinead Carew  Labor expenses will be a key focus during retailers' earnings conference calls in the coming weeks, with many companies under pressure to boost workers' wages at a time when low U.S. unemployment levels have given workers more leverage.Wal-Mart (WMT.N), Target Corp (TGT.N), T.J. Maxx (TJX.N), Gap (GPS.N), and McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) have already announced wage increases, and the trend appears to be trickling further into the retail and restaurant sectors.""The competition for that job is tougher for the employer. The employee has choices now,"" said Thomas Sudyka, managing director at investment management firm Lawson Kroeker based in Omaha, Nebraska.So far in this reporting season, companies such as Bed Bath & Beyond Inc (BBBY.O) and Buffalo Wild Wings Inc (BWLD.O) have discussed wage pressure, while Pier 1 Imports Inc (PIR.N) plans incentive pay for the first time in three years. Fast-food workers have been vocal in fighting for better wages. They rallied in U.S. cities on April 15 to demand higher pay, using the deadline for filing tax returns to publicize their argument that they cannot survive on the hourly wages paid by many U.S. corporations.The U.S. government said Friday U.S. job growth rebounded last month and the unemployment rate dropped to a near seven-year low of 5.4 percent, while average hourly earnings rose three cents in April, a year-on-year gain of 2.2 percent. RESULTS  Big retailers reporting in the week starting May 13 include Macys Inc (M.N), Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) and Kohl's Corp (KSS.N). The following week, Home Depot (HD.N), Wal-Mart, Staples Inc (SPLS.O), Target and Gap are due to report. Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) and Tiffany & Co (TIF.N) both report on May 27.Macys, Kohl's and Home Depot say they set their wages on a market-by-market basis as the competitive situation varies around the country. Kohl's said it also watches other factors driving employee decisions, such as the work environment and future opportunities for advancement.  Staples in March discussed a 2014 cash build-up for incentive compensation that would be paid out in 2015 but it did not give details. Bed Bath & Beyond said during a conference call early in April it had planned for an additional expense of 6 cents a share this year due to increased compensation. Analysts expect Bed Bath & Beyond to earn about $1.91 per share this year on a fully reported basis, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. ""We are modeling an increase in our investments in compensation and benefits beyond what we have always historically planned for, to continue to assure that we preserve our ability to attract, and retain, the best associates,"" Sue Lattmann, the company's chief financial officer told investors.HIGHER WAGES, HIGHER COSTS  Many companies will try to cut other costs, or raise prices where they can to absorb the extra expense of higher wages, said Lawson Kroeker's Sudyka.During its quarterly conference call on April 28, Buffalo Wild Wings told investors it faced pressure to raise the salaries of minimum wage workers as well as higher-paid workers. There were also additional labor costs from the creation of new roles aimed at boosting sales.  Chief Operating Officer James Schmidt told investors that ""if labor has to be a little higher, but it's driving higher same-store sales, we would look and try to look at other lines of the (profit and loss statement) where we can recapture that.""Some analysts said investors will likely take wage increases in their stride, as better pay should translate to improved sales, with consumers having more money to spend.""Even if companies can't pass on the costs, it's a one-time hit and we can grow from there,"" Sudyka said.

476,"  (Adds Wal-Mart comment, background)May 8 Wal-Mart Stores Inc's Canadian unit said it would buy some store leases and other assets formerly held by the Canadian arm of Target Corp and renovate them for about C$350 million ($289 million).Wal-Mart said in February it planned to invest about C$340 million this year to boost its presence in Canada.The company said on Friday it would acquire a Target Canada distribution center, 12 store leases and an owned property for C$165 million. It expects to invest about C$185 million on their renovation.Organizations owed money by Target Canada controlled the sale, Alex Roberton, Wal-Mart Canada's director of corporate affairs, told Reuters. Target was not immediately available for comment.Wal-Mart, which plans to hire about 3,400 associates in British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec, said it expects to generate about 1,500 trade and construction jobs in Canada. Target, The No. 2 U.S. discount chain, exited Canada last month after struggling since its March 2013 launch there, resulting in 17,000 employees losing their jobs and triggering a $5.1 billion quarterly charge.Target Canada, which said it would close the last of its 133 retail stores on April 12, had said the real estate sales process was expected to be completed by June. The company had been winding down operations since Jan. 15 when it was granted creditor protection.Earlier this week, Retailer Canadian Tire Corp Ltd  said it would buy leases for 12 properties previously held by Target Canada for $17.7 million.Canadian retailers Metro Inc and Hudson's Bay Co  have also shown interest in leasing Target's properties.($1 = C$1.2095)   (Reporting By Manya Venkatesh and Yashaswini Swamynathan in Bengaluru; Editing by Joyjeet Das)",2015-05-08,WMT,"Fri May 8, 2015 | 7:53am EDT",UPDATE 2-Wal-Mart buys some former Target Canada stores,http://www.reuters.com//article/wal-mart-stores-canada-idUSL4N0XZ64020150508?type=companyNews

478,"   By Sinead Carew  Labor expenses will be a key focus during retailers' earnings conference calls in the coming weeks, with many companies under pressure to boost workers' wages at a time when low U.S. unemployment levels have given workers more leverage.Wal-Mart (WMT.N), Target Corp (TGT.N), T.J. Maxx (TJX.N), Gap (GPS.N), and McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) have already announced wage increases, and the trend appears to be trickling further into the retail and restaurant sectors.""The competition for that job is tougher for the employer. The employee has choices now,"" said Thomas Sudyka, managing director at investment management firm Lawson Kroeker based in Omaha, Nebraska.So far in this reporting season, companies such as Bed Bath & Beyond Inc (BBBY.O) and Buffalo Wild Wings Inc (BWLD.O) have discussed wage pressure, while Pier 1 Imports Inc (PIR.N) plans incentive pay for the first time in three years. Fast-food workers have been vocal in fighting for better wages. They rallied in U.S. cities on April 15 to demand higher pay, using the deadline for filing tax returns to publicize their argument that they cannot survive on the hourly wages paid by many U.S. corporations.The U.S. government said Friday U.S. job growth rebounded last month and the unemployment rate dropped to a near seven-year low of 5.4 percent, while average hourly earnings rose three cents in April, a year-on-year gain of 2.2 percent. RESULTS  Big retailers reporting in the week starting May 13 include Macys Inc (M.N), Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) and Kohl's Corp (KSS.N). The following week, Home Depot (HD.N), Wal-Mart, Staples Inc (SPLS.O), Target and Gap are due to report. Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) and Tiffany & Co (TIF.N) both report on May 27.Macys, Kohl's and Home Depot say they set their wages on a market-by-market basis as the competitive situation varies around the country. Kohl's said it also watches other factors driving employee decisions, such as the work environment and future opportunities for advancement.  Staples in March discussed a 2014 cash build-up for incentive compensation that would be paid out in 2015 but it did not give details. Bed Bath & Beyond said during a conference call early in April it had planned for an additional expense of 6 cents a share this year due to increased compensation. Analysts expect Bed Bath & Beyond to earn about $1.91 per share this year on a fully reported basis, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. ""We are modeling an increase in our investments in compensation and benefits beyond what we have always historically planned for, to continue to assure that we preserve our ability to attract, and retain, the best associates,"" Sue Lattmann, the company's chief financial officer told investors.HIGHER WAGES, HIGHER COSTS  Many companies will try to cut other costs, or raise prices where they can to absorb the extra expense of higher wages, said Lawson Kroeker's Sudyka.During its quarterly conference call on April 28, Buffalo Wild Wings told investors it faced pressure to raise the salaries of minimum wage workers as well as higher-paid workers. There were also additional labor costs from the creation of new roles aimed at boosting sales.  Chief Operating Officer James Schmidt told investors that ""if labor has to be a little higher, but it's driving higher same-store sales, we would look and try to look at other lines of the (profit and loss statement) where we can recapture that.""Some analysts said investors will likely take wage increases in their stride, as better pay should translate to improved sales, with consumers having more money to spend.""Even if companies can't pass on the costs, it's a one-time hit and we can grow from there,"" Sudyka said.

481,"   By Nathan Layne | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Wal-Mart Stores (WMT.N) said it will start disclosing directly to investors what it spends on lobbying on a state-by-state basis, responding to shareholder pressure to improve transparency on how the retailing giant seeks to influence public policy.    The previously unreported move would make Wal-Mart the first constituent of the Dow Jones Industrial Average to break out state expenditures at that level of detail, drawing attention to spending that in some states reaches hundreds of thousands of dollars. Wal-Mart's move could chart a course for others, just as rival retailers followed suit when it raised worker pay earlier this year.    While federal guidelines are uniform and fairly detailed, disclosure at the state level varies widely and information can be difficult to find, undermining attempts at oversight by outside groups. At the same time, gridlock in Congress has shifted the focus of some corporate lobbying to the states, raising the importance of transparency, disclosure advocates said.    Wal-Mart's decision to make state lobbying information more accessible is ""exceedingly important"" because spending at the state level can rival or exceed federal lobbying expenditures and also because of the company's size and influence across the corporate sector, said Timothy Smith, director of socially responsible investing at Walden Asset Management, which has backed several shareholder proposals seeking improved disclosure.    Since the first shareholder proposals targeting lobbying first appeared in 2011, there have been 143 resolutions on the ballots at 80 companies, and support has risen to an average of 29.2 percent of votes this year, according to proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services.    Wal-Mart's move falls short of what Zevin Asset Management sought when it submitted a shareholder resolution for wider disclosure at Wal-Mart, including any ""indirect lobbying"" through organizations like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Wal-Mart will not change its disclosure policies on trade associations, spokesman Randy Hargrove said.    Zevin Director Sonia Kowal said she withdrew the proposal as a sign of ""good faith"" after Wal-Mart agreed to aggregate state disclosures. She said she would resubmit the proposal next year.    Kowal said she has found Wal-Mart to be responsive to shareholder engagement ""perhaps because they see disclosure of corporate involvement in politics as being increasingly important to investors and that interest is not likely to diminish.""    Wal-Mart will not report any information not already available in state disclosures. But within a few months it plans to start providing a tally for spending in each state with a link to the relevant filing, aiming to make it easier for investors to find the information, Hargrove said.     ""We take our commitment to provide additional transparency into our political engagement seriously,"" Hargrove said, noting that Wal-Mart already provides links to quarterly federal lobbying reports on its website, among other steps.          BYZANTINE DISCLOSURE     The act of aggregating state data into a readable format is a significant step because the ""Byzantine"" manner in which the data is captured and made available online effectively buries information at many states, said Denise Roth Barber, managing director at the National Institute on Money in State Politics, which itself has struggled to build a comprehensive database of state spending.    ""Given the wide disparity of disclosure laws and how that information is provided to the public it is nearly impossible to find this information out on your own,"" she said, adding the move by Wal-Mart could prod others to disclose more. ""It would be impressive for Wal-Mart to provide that information in one place.""     In 2014 Wal-Mart spent $7 million on lobbying at the federal level, making it one of the largest corporate spenders. It was active in targeting issues like labor, tax and trade, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact being pushed by President Barack Obama, public filings show.    The biggest corporate spenders include Comcast and Google at about $17 million each, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.     States such as California and Wisconsin require relatively detailed disclosure including payments to lobbyists and what bills were lobbied on. In several states like Georgia the reporting of lobbyist compensation is not mandatory, meaning only typically smaller outlays, such as dinners with legislators, are available. In some cases figuring out what was spent can prove tricky, requiring digging into reports from multiple lobbyists in formats decipherable only to the trained eye.       Filings from California show Wal-Mart paid lobbyists $319,000 last year to advocate on its behalf on various laws, including some tied to wages and other labor issues. Spending in Texas, which only requires the disclosure of a range, may have been as high as $315,000, filings show.     While pleased with the move on state disclosure, Zevin's Kowal said shareholders want greater transparency on all spending, including trade associations and tax-exempt organizations writing model legislation.         When Zevin submitted its proposal last year, it cited concerns over Wal-Mart's involvement with the Chamber of Commerce in part because the association had reportedly lobbied against the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.     Bruce Freed, president of the Center for Political Accountability, believes that in general corporate disclosure on political spending and lobbying has been improving. But he says the picture will remain incomplete until contributions to organizations like the Chamber of Commerce and social welfare groups exempt from reporting donors are disclosed.     ""In the end what you really are looking for are the spending figures that are not disclosed, and that includes the major trade associations,"" Freed said.

However, investments in e-commerce shaved 2 cents off the retailer's earnings per share, equal to the cost impact in the quarter of its move to raise wages for entry level workers across the U.S.Because of the high growth rates, most analysts see merit in investing aggressively in e-commerce. But as Wal-Mart prepares to test a free shipping program aimed at undercutting Amazon on price, the prospect of competing with a rival that spends heavily on investments has raised some concerns.

""We feel like that's a great advantage that we can leverage,"" Wal-Mart Chief Financial Officer Charles Holley said on Tuesday, when asked about competition with Amazon. He said his response was not particular to Amazon.Converting conventional distribution centers to handle e-commerce probably costs $20 million to $40 million dollars each, while building a large-scale fulfillment facility from scratch can cost $150 million, estimates Steven Osburn, director at Kurt Salmon specializing in supply chain.Given that, any attempt to catch up with Amazon could run into the billions of dollars, Osburn said. ""However, finding ways to use their existing infrastructure better is a much cheaper way to go about it.""

497,"   By P.J. Huffstutter and Nathan Layne | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) is pressing meat, seafood, dairy and egg suppliers to reduce the use of antibiotics, becoming the first large retailer to take such a public stand against the excessive use of drugs in raising farm animals.The voluntary guidelines announced on Friday would limit suppliers to using antibiotics to treat and prevent disease, and not for promoting growth, a controversial practice by livestock producers. The move comes as concern is growing that over-use of antibiotics in animals can spawn drug-resistant superbugs, endangering human health. Wal-Mart, the country's biggest food retailer, is also telling suppliers not to raise animals in gestation crates or in other conditions considered inhumane.The retailer is asking suppliers to its roughly 5,200 Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores in the United States to publicly disclose their use of antibiotics and treatment of animals on an annual basis.In March McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) said in two years its U.S. restaurants would stop buying chicken raised with human antibiotics, marking the first time a major U.S. company had taken concrete action and set a timetable to it. Bulk retailer Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O), a Wal-Mart rival, has said it was working with suppliers to phase out chicken and livestock raised with antibiotics that are used to fight human infections.But Wal-Mart's move is the most significant by a retailer so far, advocates said. Since it controls a quarter of the U.S. grocery market, the guidelines will likely ripple through the entire food supply chain and prompt rivals to follow suit.""They're the first ones who have asked for this sort of data and to make it public. We haven't gotten that from anyone else, including the U.S. government,"" said Gail Hansen, senior officer for Pew Charitable Trusts' antibiotic resistance project. ""Because of its size, Wal-Mart can drive the industry on this and they can do more,"" said Susan Vaughn Grooters, policy analyst with the nonprofit group Keep Antibiotics Working.  In 2013 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration released guidelines for drug makers and agricultural companies to voluntarily phase out antibiotics as a growth enhancer in livestock.But the extent to which U.S. meat producers are using such drugs is unclear. The U.S. Agriculture Department is planning to begin collecting more detailed data on antibiotics used on farms, a potential precursor to setting targets for reducing use of the drugs in animals.Wal-Mart said its move was rooted in consumer demand. It cited an internal study showing that 77 percent of its customers would increase their trust and 66 percent were more likely to shop from a retailer that ensures humane treatment of livestock. ""Our customers want to know more about how their food is grown and raised, and where it comes from.

498,"  (Adds industry context, response from animal rights groups)By P.J. Huffstutter and Nathan LayneCHICAGO May 22 Wal-Mart Stores Inc is pressing meat, seafood, dairy and egg suppliers to reduce the use of antibiotics, becoming the first large retailer to take such a public stand against the excessive use of drugs in raising farm animals.The voluntary guidelines announced on Friday would limit suppliers to using antibiotics to treat and prevent disease, and not for promoting growth, a controversial practice by livestock producers. The move comes as concern is growing that over-use of antibiotics in animals can spawn drug-resistant superbugs, endangering human health.Wal-Mart, the country's biggest food retailer, is also telling suppliers not to raise animals in gestation crates or in other conditions considered inhumane.The retailer is asking suppliers to its roughly 5,200 Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores in the United States to publicly disclose their use of antibiotics and treatment of animals on an annual basis.In March McDonald's Corp said in two years its U.S. restaurants would stop buying chicken raised with human antibiotics, marking the first time a major U.S. company had taken concrete action and set a timetable to it. Bulk retailer Costco Wholesale Corp, a Wal-Mart rival, has said it was working with suppliers to phase out chicken and livestock raised with antibiotics that are used to fight human infections.But Wal-Mart's move is the most significant by a retailer so far, advocates said. Since it controls a quarter of the U.S. grocery market, the guidelines will likely ripple through the entire food supply chain and prompt rivals to follow suit. ""They're the first ones who have asked for this sort of data and to make it public. We haven't gotten that from anyone else, including the U.S. government,"" said Gail Hansen, senior officer for Pew Charitable Trusts' antibiotic resistance project.""Because of its size, Wal-Mart can drive the industry on this and they can do more,"" said Susan Vaughn Grooters, policy analyst with the nonprofit group Keep Antibiotics Working.In 2013 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration released guidelines for drug makers and agricultural companies to voluntarily phase out antibiotics as a growth enhancer in livestock. But the extent to which U.S. meat producers are using such drugs is unclear. The U.S. Agriculture Department is planning to begin collecting more detailed data on antibiotics used on farms, a potential precursor to setting targets for reducing use of the drugs in animals.Wal-Mart said its move was rooted in consumer demand. It cited an internal study showing that 77 percent of its customers would increase their trust and 66 percent were more likely to shop from a retailer that ensures humane treatment of livestock.""Our customers want to know more about how their food is grown and raised, and where it comes from.

508,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) said it would raise minimum wages for over 100,000 U.S. employees including some department managers and deli workers, its second wage hike this year.Wal-Mart, the largest private employer in the United States with 1.3 million U.S. workers, has been targeted by labor groups for its minimum wages. The company said in February that it would raise minimum wages for 500,000 U.S. employees. The wage increases seem aimed at discouraging worker unionization, said Gary Chaison, professor of industrial relations at Clark University. ""The general feeling is, 'Why join the union to negotiate with Wal-Mart when Wal-Mart takes care of its own?'"" he said.Retailers and fast food chains including McDonald's Corp (MCD.N), Target Corp (TGT.N) and TJX Cos (TJX.N) have also raised wages as they struggle to retain workers, who switch between the two industries in a tightening labor market. ""We do think this (wage increases) will help reduce turnover and increase retention,"" Wal-Mart spokesman Kory Lundberg said. Wal-Mart does not disclose its workforce turnover rate. Lundberg said the rate was below the industry average. The company said on Tuesday that it would increase hourly wages for managers of service-oriented departments such as electronics and auto care from July to $13-$24.70 from $10.30-$20.09.Hourly wage of managers of departments such as clothing and consumer products will rise to $10.90-$20.71 from $9.90-$19.31.At specialized areas such as the deli sections, workers will earn $9.90-$18.81 per hour compared with $9.20-$18.53 currently. Associated Press first reported the news. (apne.ws/1FrrG2W)Labor and other groups have been pushing for a higher federal minimum wage, which was last hiked in 2009 to $7.25 per hour. In the 2014 State of the Union address, President Barack Obama called on Congress to raise the national minimum wage to $10.10 an hour.""It (Wal-Mart's wage increases) pretty much ends the debate about whether there should be a minimum wage increase, the question now is exactly how much,"" Chaison said. Wal-Mart will also start paying store associates 10 percent more per hour upon promotion, starting with their Aug. 13 paycheck, Lundberg said.This means the minimum increase in hourly wage of an associate who has been promoted will rise to 90 cents from about 50 cents.  However, United Food and Commercial Workers International Union spokesman Marc Goumbri said Wal-Mart needed to do more, including raising entry-level minimum wage to $15 per hour and providing consistent full-time work to associates.

In the 2014 State of the Union address, President Barack Obama called on Congress to raise the national minimum wage to $10.10 an hour.""It (Wal-Mart's wage increases) pretty much ends the debate about whether there should be a minimum wage increase, the question now is exactly how much,"" Chaison said.Wal-Mart will also start paying store associates 10 percent more per hour upon promotion, starting with their Aug. 13 paycheck, Lundberg said.This means the minimum increase in hourly wage of an associate who has been promoted will rise to 90 cents from about 50 cents.However, United Food and Commercial Workers International Union spokesman Marc Goumbri said Wal-Mart needed to do more, including raising entry-level minimum wage to $15 per hour and providing consistent full-time work to associates.

510,"   By Tiisetso Motsoeneng | JOHANNESBURG  JOHANNESBURG When Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) spent $2.4 billion on a stake in South Africa's Massmart (MSMJ.J) five years ago, the world's biggest retailer said it was buying a gateway to high-growth markets in sub-Saharan Africa.Despite its powerful U.S. backer, South Africa's number three retailer, selling everything from food to electronics, has added fewer than 10 stores to the existing 25 outside its home market since 2010, lagging rival Shoprite, which doubled its outlets to 300.Massmart's slow inroads into the rest of the continent, touted as the next big growth area, highlight the challenges of doing business in Africa, and raise questions about Wal-Mart's goal of rapid expansion abroad.""From the start the Africa Rising story was a bit euphoric when looking at it from a retail point of view, and Wal-Mart is now facing the reality,"" said Boris Planer, analyst at London's Planet Retail.South Africa's Shoprite, which many investors expected to be a casualty of Wal-Mart's investment in Massmart, has nevertheless pushed ahead in familiar local markets where the U.S. retail giant has moved more cautiously.""If you want extra growth, you've got to take on that extra risk,"" said Wayne McCurrie, a fund manager at Momentum Wealth in Pretoria.""Recognising that risk, by that I mean a severe shortage of shopping infrastructure, Shoprite started setting up warehouses and partnering with developers to build shopping centres and that's why it is in this quick store rollout phase whereas Massmart is a little bit behind.""Guy Hayward, an accountant who took over as Massmart CEO a year ago, acknowledges the need to catch up with Shoprite, whose CEO cheekily asked in 2013: ""Where is Wal-Mart?""""We all face challenges but Shoprite has done a good job in getting ahead,"" he told Reuters.Wal-Mart's slow progress in Africa also underscores the struggles the U.S. company faces in pursuing a rapid expansion to 27 countries and 6,300 stores outside the U.S. market.    Scott Mushkin, who covers Wal-Mart at Wolfe Research, has argued Wal-Mart should look to exit markets in Asia, Europe and Africa due to lower returns than in the Americas. “We believe these operations are a distraction from what appears to be a fairly synergistic operating model from Canada to Chile,” he wrote in a note to clients this month. Wal-Mart said it was still committed to Africa.""We are excited by the retail opportunities in Africa and we’re confident in the ability of Massmart’s leadership to drive future growth,"" said Marilee McInnis, director of International Corporate Affairs at Walmart.   FAILED DEALS  The last five years in Africa have been punctuated, for Massmart, by deals that failed to come off.Grant Pattison, who abruptly resigned last year as chief executive, tried and failed to buy Botswana's biggest grocer Choppies Enterprises CHOPP.BT, Ramachandran Ottapathu, Choppies CEO told Reuters. In Kenya, Massmart was unable to complete a deal with private retailer Naivas because of a family dispute over its ownership.At home, too, some customers are underwhelmed by Massmart's performance. Famed for its aggressive pricing, it appears to be struggling to compete with Shoprite on cheap groceries.""I was very excited when I heard Wal-Mart is bringing low prices to South Africa but I haven't seen that,"" said Themba Khumalo, a 31-year old bank teller outside a Johannesburg shopping mall. Wal-Mart has also had problems in its bid to fast-track the expansion of Massmart's grocery unit Game. Massmart has complained to the competition watchdog against three rivals over shopping mall leases that prevent Game from selling groceries.AFRICA RISING  Wal-Mart, and other international companies, want to benefit from a continent poised for dynamic growth fuelled by a rising young population of workers and consumers and global demand for its commodities, an idea known as 'Africa Rising'. There are promising signs for retailers: Shoprite's Basson reported ""insatiable"" demand for big brands after five Shoprite stores in Angola sold more Red Bull cans than nearly all 400 stores in South Africa in one year.But others are also finding it tough. Woolworths (WHLJ.J), a Cape Town-based upscale retailer, pulled the plug on its Nigerian business, citing high rents and duties.The Spar Group (SPPJ.J), which runs franchise grocery stores, said its partner in Nigeria has managed to open just five of 20 planned stores, having struggled to find suitable real estate and having to import everything from lighting and tiles to refrigerators.Pick n Pay (PIKJ.J), South Africa's third biggest grocer by value, recently shut its franchise stores in Mozambique and Mauritius because they were not profitable.""Retail in Africa is just not that romantic, it's not easy.  Anything that looks like an overnight success has probably been around for 20 years,"" said Pick n Pay Chief Executive Richard Brasher, while stressing the group is still seeking to expand.A common complaint is the time it takes to get goods from ports to shelves.""Even if you air-freight the goods and you think within a week your goods could be in store, it may take five weeks,"" said Ronnie Steyn, chief financial officer of TFG (TFGJ.J), the biggest reseller of Nike Inc (NKE.N) and Adidas AG (ADSGn.DE) products in South Africa.   France's Carrefour (CARR.PA), the world's second biggest retailer by sales, has taken a cautious approach. It has focused on China and Brazil as its key markets for expansion, while opting in Africa for franchise deals with strong local connections. ""Going into Africa is still a little bit adventurous in a way, compared to, for example, Asia,  which has mega-cities and plenty of shopping malls,"" said Marieke Witjes, a retail consultant at AT Kearney in Johannesburg. ""That's why a lot of international players are still kind of fearful about putting their money into Africa.""SPACE SHORTAGE  Hayward said Massmart remained committed to expanding further into the rest of Africa but cited the familiar list of challenges, including haphazard property laws and poor infrastructure.Among the biggest is the shortage of real estate space and big malls, something that prompted Shoprite to raise 3 billion rand three years ago to team up with developers to build its own stand-alone stores in markets such as Nigeria.""Do I advise my clients to stay away from Africa given Wal-Mart's experience? No. Do I advise them to wait until there are enough shopping malls in countries like Nigeria to build critical mass? Yes,"" said one retail consultant in Johannesburg, who declined to be named.Hayward said Massmart has started setting up its own stand-alone stores and was also considering partnering with landlords on building properties.The strategy would help Massmart open 19 stores in several African countries by the end of February next year, and increase its trading space by more than 45 percent, he said. Gabriel Sacks, investment manager at Scottish-based Aberdeen Asset Management, the third largest shareholder in Massmart with more than 4 percent, is prepared to be patient.""Whilst we appreciate the market's frustration with the pace of growth, we are of the view that a more cautious approach to rolling out stores in Africa is no bad thing given our preference for capital discipline,"" Sacks said.""Faster growth would be welcome, but not at all costs.""

515,"   By Nathan Layne and Ross Kerber | BENTONVILLE, Arkansas/BOSTON  BENTONVILLE, Arkansas/BOSTON Even as Wal-Mart Stores Inc showed unusual openness to outsiders' complaints by taking steps including raising wages, it has been trying to slam the door on a shareholder proposal that could weaken the founding Walton family's power over its board.The investors are pushing hard for changes in how the world's No. 1 retailer governs itself, seeking to install an independent chairman. Many also support a measure that would require wider disclosure of when it has “clawed back"" compensation from executives linked to ethical missteps.Crucial to the debate will be the stance of BlackRock Inc, Wal-Mart's No. 3 shareholder, which last year appeared to take the company to task for its response to a Mexican bribery scandal which has angered a number of shareholders. Wal-Mart, which says it cares about outside shareholders views, has met with BlackRock twice since last year.The persistent investor gripes come as the retailer puts its best foot forward at this week's shareholders' meeting outside of Bentonville, Arkansas where it is based. Wal-Mart has brought in thousands of workers from around the world for a three-day, celebrity-studded affair that culminates in Friday's annual meeting.“Wal-Mart shareowners have been pushing for a more independent and accountable board ever since the bribery-related allegations several years ago exposed serious board oversight failures,"" New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, who oversees city pension funds with $160 billion in assets, said in a statement.""The company will not succeed in restoring investor confidence in its business practices and compliance until it heeds the calls to overhaul its board,"" Stringer said.The Comptroller's office was behind one of several derivative lawsuits filed by investors against Wal-Mart in 2012 related to the bribery allegations. That suit is ongoing.Wal-Mart spokesman Randy Hargrove said the company takes governance seriously and has reached out to many of its largest shareholders to discuss its strategy and policies, and shared the insights of those meetings with the board.""We’ll continue to evaluate and act upon the recommendations that the board feels are in the best interest of all of our shareholders,"" he said.This year the company will trumpet a move announced in February to invest $1 billion in wages and training as a sign of its willingness to listen to critics, who have long blasted the company for not paying a ""living wage"".  But Wal-Mart has sought to quash criticism from another quarter in the form of shareholders pushing to install an independent chairman. Family scion Rob Walton has served as chairman for 23 years.Shareholders have made similar proposals in the last two years but Wal-Mart this year for the first time petitioned the Securities and Exchange Commission to exclude the proposal. The request was denied.Wal-Mart believes its board structure is sound, Hargrove said. Its lead director is independent, as are 11 of 16 members, and it separates the roles of chairman and chief executive. The rebel shareholders argue a chairman without ties to management or the founding family could help better address the bribery allegations and avoid similar occurrences elsewhere. The company has spent $612 million over the past three years on legal and related costs to cope with an investigation into the matter, which remains unresolved.Because the Walton family owns 50.9 percent of the retailer's shares, outside shareholder proposals face daunting odds. But a significantly higher rate of support among non-Walton votes could prod independent board members to adopt reforms, some governance experts said. BlackRock, which is the world’s largest asset manager and is seen as a key swing vote, has slowly offered more detail about its voting practices.Friday’s meeting will be the first since a June 2014 governance report in which BlackRock said it had raised concerns “with a global retailer after allegations of bribery surfaced at the company” and that its requests for follow-up meetings had gone unanswered.    Wal-Mart’s Hargrove said the company has met with BlackRock twice in the past year, which could help address its concerns.BlackRock would not confirm that the report pertained to Wal-Mart or comment on its voting at Wal-Mart this year. But the descriptions in its report matched how its funds voted at the retailer, including support for the independent chairman proposal last year.“It’s one thing when you have pension funds and activist investors raising concerns about a company like Wal-Mart, but when you have BlackRock raising that concern that brings the debate right into the mainstream,"" said William Atwood, executive director of the Illinois State Board of Investment. CLAWBACK The top two proxy advisory firms, Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis, have recommended votes for the independent chairman proposal this year, as they did in the prior two years.While the independent chairman proposal got just 15.4 percent of the overall vote last year, support among non-Walton shares, assuming all Walton shares were voted, was 40 percent, up from 35.6 percent in 2013.Last June Wal-Mart named director Gregory Penner as vice chairman, a move viewed by many as setting him up to one day succeed his father-in-law Rob Walton, who is 70 years old, atop the board. ""The bottom line is this is a family firm and change is going to be very slow coming,"" said Ric Marshall, executive director at MSCI ESG Research.The ""clawback"" proposal, which was also launched after the bribery allegations surfaced in 2012, got 38 percent of non-Walton votes, last year. Wal-Mart is recommending a vote against it, arguing that it already discloses enough on the issue.""It's an area where the company has not been responsive to a very reasonable proposal,"" said Laura Jordan, assistant treasurer at the state of Connecticut. ""It has the sense of digging in its heels.""

516,"  June 4 Wal-Mart Stores has a new priority: reducing theft.Greg Foran, head of the retailer's U.S. operations, told a media briefing on Thursday he added theft and other forms of ""unknown shrinkage"" to a list of urgent items to be tackled at Wal-Mart's 4,555 stores across the United States.Foran said he saw an opportunity to boost margins by putting a dent in a problem that typically represents 1 percent for any retailer's sales. He noted that Wal-Mart generated nearly $300 billion in revenues in the United States in the past fiscal year.""One percent of $300 billion is quite a lot of money. If you can save 10 basis points of it - boy I'll take it every day of the week and put it into lower prices for customers,"" Foran told Reuters after the briefing. One basis point is equal to one hundredth of 1 percent, meaning that 10 basis points - or 0.1 percent - of $300 billion would be equal to $30 million. Wal-Mart had flagged the issue when it announced its first quarter earnings last month, saying that ""shrink"" was a major contributor to a 13 basis point decline in its gross profit margin. It said half of the problem was related to food.Foran said unknown shrinkage could include problems like mistakes in inventory record-keeping in addition to stealing by customers or employees. He said the problem was not necessarily growing, but he decided to focus on it given the potential margin boost.After Foran took over as head of the U.S. business in August, he instituted a series of ""urgent agenda"" items aimed at improving store management. Foran said he had taken two projects off that list and added two more, including the focus on shrinkage. He did not provide further details.

But a significantly higher rate of support among non-Walton votes could prod independent board members to adopt reforms, some governance experts said.BlackRock, which is the world's largest asset manager and is seen as a key swing vote, has slowly offered more detail about its voting practices.Friday's meeting will be the first since a June 2014 governance report in which BlackRock said it had raised concerns ""with a global retailer after allegations of bribery surfaced at the company"" and that its requests for follow-up meetings had gone unanswered.Wal-Mart's Hargrove said the company has met with BlackRock twice in the past year, which could help address its concerns.BlackRock would not confirm that the report pertained to Wal-Mart or comment on its voting at Wal-Mart this year. But the descriptions in its report matched how its funds voted at the retailer, including support for the independent chairman proposal last year. ""It's one thing when you have pension funds and activist investors raising concerns about a company like Wal-Mart, but when you have BlackRock raising that concern that brings the debate right into the mainstream,"" said William Atwood, executive director of the Illinois State Board of Investment.CLAWBACK The top two proxy advisory firms, Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis, have recommended votes for the independent chairman proposal this year, as they did in the prior two years.While the independent chairman proposal got just 15.4 percent of the overall vote last year, support among non-Walton shares, assuming all Walton shares were voted, was 40 percent, up from 35.6 percent in 2013.Last June Wal-Mart named director Gregory Penner as vice chairman, a move viewed by many as setting him up to one day succeed his father-in-law Rob Walton, who is 70 years old, atop the board.""The bottom line is this is a family firm and change is going to be very slow coming,"" said Ric Marshall, executive director at MSCI ESG Research.The ""clawback"" proposal, which was also launched after the bribery allegations surfaced in 2012, got 38 percent of non-Walton votes, last year. Wal-Mart is recommending a vote against it, arguing that it already discloses enough on the issue.""It's an area where the company has not been responsive to a very reasonable proposal,"" said Laura Jordan, assistant treasurer at the state of Connecticut. ""It has the sense of digging in its heels.""

518,"   By Nathan Layne | FAYETTEVILLE, Arkansas  FAYETTEVILLE, Arkansas Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) named the son-in-law of chairman Rob Walton as his successor on Friday, cementing the founding family's influence over the retailer as shareholders defeated a measure calling for an independent director to lead the board.Some investors, including large pension funds, had been pushing for a chairman without ties to the Waltons, Wal-Mart's founding family. They argued that the company needed stricter oversight after a bribery scandal involving its Mexico operations surfaced three years ago.The proposal calling for an independent board chairman garnered 16 percent of voted shares, slightly more than a similar measure last year. But as expected the Waltons, who own around 51 percent of Wal-Mart's shares, and their supporters easily voted it down.Greg Penner, 45, took over as chairman from Rob Walton as of the end of Friday's annual shareholders' meeting in Fayetteville, Arkansas, near where the world's largest retailer was founded nearly 53 years ago. Penner joined the family through his marriage to the granddaughter of founder Sam Walton. Walton died in 1992.Wal-Mart said Penner, a former Goldman Sachs analyst whose roles in the retailer have included a senior position at the online business and as chief financial officer in Japan, brought strong operational experience in addition to his family ties.  ""His experience and background are going to help us as a company move into the future,"" Doug McMillon, Wal-Mart's chief executive officer, said at a media briefing, citing Penner's knowledge of its China business as another asset.The shareholder proposal had the support of both major proxy advisory firms, Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis, as well as some big investors, including the manager of $160 billion of New York City pension funds. 'GREAT BALANCE' “We voted for an independent chair and Greg Penner is not independent,"" New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer said in a statement. ""The Wal-Mart board's decision to name Penner as chairman serves the interests of the Walton family at the expense of the company and its outside shareowners and is further evidence of the need for an overhaul of the board.”The independent chairman proposal was one of five outside proposals that were rejected on Friday. The others included a measure calling for disclosure on when compensation is recouped from executives involved in wrongdoing, which was also spawned by the ongoing bribery probe. Penner has been on the board since 2008 and was named vice chairman in June, a move that had set the stage for him to replace Rob Walton, the 70-year-old son of the founder and chairman for the past 23 years. McMillon said Walton, who will remain on as a director, would maintain an outsize presence at the company: ""Someone asked me earlier what role will he play and my answer was whatever role he wants to play,"" the CEO said.Penner told the 14,000 workers, shareholders and others at the shareholders' meeting that the board's structure was sound. After Friday's election, 10 of the 15 directors are considered independent, while three had family ties.""Because of our family’s commitment, combined with strong independent director voices, we have a great balance,"" said Penner, who has been a partner at the Walton family-backed investment firm Madrone Capital Partners since 2005.All 15 directors on the ballot were elected with at least 92.8 percent support, the company said. Support for Rob Walton  increased to 95 percent from 88 percent in 2014, reflecting a decision by ISS to drop opposition to his re-election this year. Penner faces considerable challenges with Wal-Mart, which is battling tough competition both in the U.S. and overseas and is struggling to meet the market's expectations for growth.  Wal-Mart shares closed Friday down 1.5 percent at $73.06, bringing its decline so far this year to about 15 percent.John Davis, faculty chair of the families in business program at Harvard Business School, said having a family member as chairman can be effective because it encourages management to take chances and invest for the long-term. Speaking in the run-up to Friday's announcement, he also pointed to Wal-Mart's earnings growth under Rob Walton: ""It’s a very responsible family – it’s worked very well so far. You are taking a big risk not to have a family chairman.”To strengthen the responsibilities of independent directors, Wal-Mart said it was realigning its board committees so most of the independent directors would serve on at least two committees. Its governance committee will be made up exclusively of independent directors.

525,"  (Corrects basis point calculation in paragraph 5)June 4 Wal-Mart Stores has a new priority: reducing theft.Greg Foran, head of the retailer's U.S. operations, told a media briefing on Thursday he added theft and other forms of ""unknown shrinkage"" to a list of urgent items to be tackled at Wal-Mart's 4,555 stores across the United States.Foran said he saw an opportunity to boost margins by putting a dent in a problem that typically represents 1 percent for any retailer's sales. He noted that Wal-Mart generated nearly $300 billion in revenues in the United States in the past fiscal year. ""One percent of $300 billion is quite a lot of money. If you can save 10 basis points of it - boy I'll take it every day of the week and put it into lower prices for customers,"" Foran told Reuters after the briefing.One basis point is equal to one hundredth of 1 percent, meaning that 10 basis points - or 0.1 percent - of $300 billion would be equal to $300 million. Wal-Mart had flagged the issue when it announced its first quarter earnings last month, saying that ""shrink"" was a major contributor to a 13 basis point decline in its gross profit margin. It said half of the problem was related to food. Foran said unknown shrinkage could include problems like mistakes in inventory record-keeping in addition to stealing by customers or employees.He said the problem was not necessarily growing, but he decided to focus on it given the potential margin boost.After Foran took over as head of the U.S. business in August, he instituted a series of ""urgent agenda"" items aimed at improving store management. Foran said he had taken two projects off that list and added two more, including the focus on shrinkage. He did not provide further details.

532,"  * Trading quiet as investors await clarity on Greek debt* Energy rises alongside oil prices; AT&T rallies on upgrades* Facebook ends at record, its market cap surpasses Wal-Mart's* Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all rise 0.1 pct   (Updates to close)By Ryan VlastelicaNEW YORK, June 23 U.S. stocks ended with slight gains on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq eking out another record close while investors continued to await clarity on whether Greece could reach a deal to prevent defaulting on its loans.The day's action was quiet, with trading volume below average. While energy shares rose alongside a jump in the price of crude oil, a sharp rise in the U.S. dollar capped broader gains. While there were no major developments involving Greece, investors continued to hope that the country's newest budget proposals - introduced on Monday - would avert a looming default.Greece needs fresh funds to avoid defaulting on a $1.8 billion debt repayment to the International Monetary Fund on June 30. Equities have been largely driven by Greece lately, with investors concerned that if the country defaults, it may have to leave the euro or the European Union, potentially shaking the region's economic foundations.""The market seems to expect that this will end favorably, or at least benignly, but I think people need to be nimble right now as circumstances could change at any time,"" said Steve Sosnick, equity-risk manager at Timber Hill/Interactive Brokers Group in Greenwich, Connecticut. ""Greece may not be all that meaningful to the U.S. market, but it could have a big impact on the euro and the dollar, and it is unclear how big of an impact that will have on stocks.""The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, rose 1.1 percent. A strong dollar is considered a headwind for equity prices as it weighs on the profits of multinational corporations.U.S. crude futures settled up 1 percent at $61.01 per barrel, lifted ahead of U.S. inventory data expected to show strong demand for gasoline. The S&P energy index  rose 0.3 percent and was one of the day's top-performing sectors. Halliburton Co rose 0.9 percent to $44.49. AT&T Inc rose 2.5 percent to $35.91 and was one of the biggest percentage gainers on the S&P 500 after at least two brokerages upgraded the stock.Facebook Inc shares rose 3.7 percent to $87.88, a record close. With the day's gains, the social network's market value is now bigger than that of Dow component Wal-Mart Stores Inc.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 24.29 points, or 0.13 percent, to 18,144.07, the S&P 500 gained 1.35 points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,124.2 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 6.12 points, or 0.12 percent, to 5,160.10. The Nasdaq ended at a record while the S&P 500 closed 0.3 percent below its own record.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,772 to 1,276, for a 1.39-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,567 issues rose and 1,203 fell for a 1.30-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.The S&P 500 posted 43 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 180 new highs and 23 new lows.About 5.4 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, below the month-to-date average of 6.15 billion.

537,"   By Nathan Layne  Wal-Mart Stores will begin charging fees to almost all vendors for stocking their items in new stores and for warehousing inventory, raising pressure on suppliers as the world’s largest retailer battles higher costs from wage hikes.The company said it started informing suppliers about the fees and other changes to supplier agreements last week. The changes, which also include amended payment terms, will affect 10,000 suppliers to its U.S. stores.While the chain has sometimes imposed such fees in the past, they were not applied uniformly. Some but not all suppliers were charged, spokeswoman Molly Blakeman said without providing details. The changes are aimed at bringing ""consistency to the collection of allowances related to the growth of our business and suppliers' use of the Walmart supply network,"" it said in a letter to suppliers, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.The new agreements mean a larger number of vendors will likely start paying fees, passing some of the retailer's costs onto suppliers, analysts said. It was unclear how much money Wal-Mart would receive as a result of the changes.For instance, Wal-Mart is seeking to charge a food supplier 10 percent of the value of inventory shipped to new stores and to new warehouses, both one-time charges, and 1 percent to hold inventory in existing warehouses, according to a copy of amended terms seen by Reuters. It is not clear from the document whether the one-time charges apply only to the initial shipment or cover a certain period of time. Currently, the supplier is not charged anything, the document shows.      The move marks a shift of sorts by Wal-Mart, which unlike other retailers has sought to limit such fees in return for demanding suppliers give it the lowest price, said Kurt Jetta, head of consumer and retail analytics firm Tabs Group Inc.     ""It is not the way Walmart has done business in the past,"" Jetta said. ""This approach suggests that they are seeking areas to offset their increased investment in wages, as well as offset their lack of organic revenue growth.""    The fees for new stores and for warehousing goods are a way of sharing the costs of growth and keeping prices low, Wal-Mart spokeswoman Deisha Barnett said: ""The changes we have outlined will help us ensure that we are operating at everyday low costs that yield everyday low prices."" The company said late last year it planned to open between 260 and 290 new stores in the fiscal year to January 2016.COST CONSIDERATIONS     Wal-Mart executives have indicated changes were coming. In April, U.S. division head Greg Foran told analysts that the company was looking at investments in marketing and other areas of the supplier relationship to squeeze costs.     While Wal-Mart has achieved three straight quarters of same-store sales growth in the United States, its margins have been weighed down by big investments in its e-commerce operations and a move to increase wages for half a million workers earlier this year.    Charges like the new-store and warehouse fees are common in the retail industry but their broad application across all suppliers is a new step for Wal-Mart, said a consultant who has talked with multiple vendor clients about the changes.    ""Not doing these things has helped Walmart get the lowest cost from vendors historically,"" said the consultant, speaking on condition of anonymity so as not to harm relations with the company.

543,"   By Daniel Wiessner  A Wal-Mart Stores Inc employee sued the retailer on Tuesday, saying its prior policy of denying health insurance to the spouses of gay employees violated gender discrimination laws.The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Boston, seeks nationwide class-action status.Wal-Mart, the largest private U.S. employer, began offering health insurance benefits to same-sex spouses last year, after the U.S. Supreme Court in 2013 struck down part of the Defense of Marriage Act that denied federal benefits to married gay couples. Even after that change, the lawsuit says, Wal-Mart workers still live with the uncertainty of losing spousal coverage.""Benefits provided by Wal-Mart as a matter of grace ... are not secure and could potentially be withdrawn just when large health care costs are incurred,"" the lawsuit says.Jackie Cote, who has worked at Walmart stores in Maine and Massachusetts since 1999, said in the lawsuit that her wife, Diana Smithson, developed cancer in 2012 and the denial of insurance led to more than $150,000 in medical debt.Cote and Smithson were married in Massachusetts in 2004, days after a court ruling made the state the first to allow gay nuptials. Smithson worked for Wal-Mart until 2008, when she left to care for Cote's elderly mother, according to the lawsuit. The company then repeatedly denied requests by Cote to add her wife to her insurance policy. Smithson is now in hospice care, Cote said.Last year, Cote filed a complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a prerequisite to filing an employment discrimination lawsuit. The commission said in January that Wal-Mart violated gender discrimination laws by denying benefits to Smithson.The commission in recent years has pioneered the argument that employment discrimination against gay people is a form of gender discrimination, since it would not happen if an employee were of the opposite sex, but it has not been vetted by courts. In Cote's case, for example, the commission said if her spouse were a man or her wife were married to a man, the couple would've received insurance.Wal-Mart argued before the commission that because federal anti-discrimination laws did not apply to gay employees, it was not obligated to provide benefits to their spouses.But the retailer's primary claim was that because it is self-insured, like many large companies, federal laws governing the administration of employee benefits preempted any discrimination claims. Companies insured by a third party, by contrast, would be subject to state insurance regulations prohibiting discrimination. Allison Wright, a lawyer with Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders, which filed Cote's lawsuit, said the group believed other large companies have similar policies in place that could be open to legal challenges.A Wal-Mart spokesman said in a statement that the company's benefits coverage before the 2014 change was legal. He declined to comment further, saying the company had not yet seen the details of the lawsuit.The lawsuit seeks to certify a class of current and former gay Wal-Mart workers who were married before Jan. 1, 2014, and various damages for employees, including the value of benefits that were denied and any out-of-pocket medical expenses.The Supreme Court last month said the U.S. Constitution provided same-sex couples the right to marry, making their marriages legal in all 50 states.The case is Cote v.

554,"  (Adds analyst comment, context)By Anya George Tharakan and Mari SaitoJuly 23 Amazon.com Inc shares surged more than 17 percent on Thursday as the online retailer posted an unexpected quarterly profit, pushing its market value above that of Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the world's largest retailer.Combined with a bullish forecast for the third quarter, upbeat comments from company executives on Amazon's Prime delivery service and rapid growth in its cloud computing service, Amazon delivered the kind of results Wall Street is looking for.Seattle-based Amazon, which last reported a profit in the 2014 fourth quarter, has often faced worries by investors that its heavy spending on new ventures will not actually pay off.""My quick take is that management has a lot of discretion over spending and appears to understand that investors prefer profits to losses,"" said Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush Securities. ""If they keep delivering profits, the stock should work.""Amazon's shares had languished for much of last year as the company failed to deliver sustainable profits. The shares traded as low as $284 last October, virtually half of the price reached in after-hours trade on Thursday.Prime, which for $99 a year also provides exclusive access to certain movies, music and Kindle books, is getting new subscribers at rates ""higher than we've ever seen,"" Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky told analysts on a conference call. Membership was growing faster outside the United States than inside, helped in part by a recent one-day sale event called ""Prime Day,"" Amazon said. It declined to disclose membership figures.""Growth has been fueled in large part by Prime growth and also (item) selection growth so it's been a huge driver both in North America and international segments,"" Olsavsky said in a separate call for reporters.For the second quarter, Amazon reported a profit of $92 million, or 19 cents per share, compared with a loss of $126 million, or 27 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 19.9 percent to $23.19 billion.Analysts on average had expected a loss of 14 cents per share on revenue of $22.39 billion. ""It looks like they beat across every major revenue line,"" said Colin Sebastian, analyst with Robert W. Baird & Co. ""That, along with the surprise profit beat, is icing on the cake, so to speak.""Sales in North America, the company's biggest market, rose 25.5 percent to $13.8 billion from a year earlier, helped by strong demand for electronics and general merchandise.Revenue from the cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services, soared 81.5 percent to $1.82 billion, accounting for nearly 8 percent of the quarter's revenue.Amazon considers Amazon Web Services a core engine of growth, along with Amazon Prime and Marketplace, where the company acts as a middleman for third-party vendors. Wall Street views AWS as an important source of stable profits. Shares of Amazon, which began as an online bookstore 20 years ago, jumped to $566.02 in after-hours trade. If the stock maintains this level on Friday, Amazon's market value would well exceed Wal-Mart's $233.52 billion.Amazon declined to comment on rising competition from new online retailers like Jet.com, which offers annual memberships at half the price of Amazon Prime and promises savings on 10 million products.Jet, which has so far raised $220 million from top venture capital firms, will list its discounted prices next to Amazon's lowest price for the same products.""We've been in competition with some of the biggest names in retail,"" Olsavsky said, ""so we're used to competition but we're focused on the customer.""The company forecast net sales would grow 13 percent to 24 percent, to a range of $23.3 billion to $25.5 billion, in the third quarter, well above analysts' consensus estimate of $23.89 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Amazon estimated third-quarter operating results ranging from a loss of $480 million to income of $70 million.(Reporting by Anya George Tharakan in Bengaluru and Mari Saito in San Francisco; Editing by Stephen R.

558,"   By Lucia Mutikani | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. economic growth accelerated in the second quarter as solid consumer spending offset the drag from weak business spending on equipment, suggesting a steady momentum that could bring the Federal Reserve closer to hiking interest rates this year.Gross domestic product expanded at a 2.3 percent annual rate, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. First-quarter GDP, previously reported to have shrunk at a 0.2 percent pace, was revised up to show it rising at a 0.6 percent rate.""This was a very constructive report and given the supportive domestic economic backdrop, we expect this positive momentum in activity to be sustained in the coming months, providing the Fed with the necessary justification to raise rates this year - perhaps as early as September,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York. The revision to first-quarter growth reflected steps taken by the government to refine the seasonal adjustment for some components of GDP, which economists said left residual seasonality in the data, as well as new source data. The report also showed a pick-up in inflation during the quarter, which economists say keeps the Fed on track for its first interest rate hike since 2006. The U.S. central bank on Wednesday described the economy as expanding ""moderately"" while upgrading its view of the labor market and saying housing had shown ""additional"" improvement. A separate report from the Labor Department showed first-time applications for unemployment benefits increased 12,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 267,000. However, claims remained near their cycle lows.The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasury debt were mixed. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower.The economy grew 1.5 percent in the first half compared to 1.9 percent during the same period in 2014. Though second-quarter GDP growth was a bit below economists' expectations for a 2.6 percent rate, the growth composition pointed to firming domestic fundamentals. A measure of private domestic demand, which excludes trade, inventories and government expenditures, increased at a solid 2.5 percent rate after rising at a 2.0 percent pace at the start of the year.  Growth in the second quarter was boosted by consumer spending as households used some of the windfall from cheaper gasoline in late 2014 and early this year to go shopping. The strengthening labor market also encouraged consumers to loosen their purse strings.Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, grew at a 2.9 percent rate from a 1.8 percent pace in the first quarter. The saving rate fell to 4.8 percent from 5.2 percent.ENERGY DRAG PERSISTS The economy also got a lift from housing, exports, and state and local government spending. However, the energy sector continued to weigh on growth as it struggles with the lingering effects of deep spending cuts by oil-field companies like Schlumberger (SLB.N) and Halliburton (HAL.N) in the aftermath of a more than 60 percent plunge in crude oil prices last year. Business investment on equipment fell at a 4.1 percent rate.Spending on mining exploration, wells and shafts plunged at a 68.2 percent rate, the largest decline since the second quarter of 1986. This category dropped at a 44.5 percent pace  in the first quarter. But there are signs that the energy spending rout might be nearing an end. Data last Friday showed U.S. energy firms added 21 oil rigs last week, marking the third increase over the past 33 weeks. Schlumberger said last week it believed the North American rig count may be bottoming and that a slow rise in both land drilling and completion activity could occur in the second half of the year.Exports rebounded in the second quarter, despite a strong dollar, while imports rose moderately. That left a smaller trade deficit that added 0.13 percentage point to GDP growth.   While businesses accumulated $110.0 billion worth of merchandise, down from $112.8 billion in the first quarter, inventories are still high and could hurt growth in the third quarter.The sturdy pace of consumer spending and a rise in oil prices pushed up inflation in the second quarter. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose at a 2.2 percent rate, the fastest since early 2012, after falling at a 1.9 percent rate in the first quarter. Excluding food and energy, prices increased at a 1.8 percent pace.""The stronger recent core PCE number probably makes this report a little bit hawkish for Fed considerations,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.

WEEK AHEAD      The stragglers for the earnings season - Home Depot, Wal-Mart and a few others - will report results to close out the quarter next week, with expectations that retailers would see decent sales after recent revisions show better-than-expected activity in the second quarter. The markets will also continue to watch the Chinese yuan after its unexpected devaluation this week, with anticipation that the dollar will strengthen a bit more, boosting bond-market activity in what is otherwise expected to be a slower week.      Fed minutes are released on Wednesday and will be parsed for clues of an interest rate rise. The Changes in the July statement pointed to an improving economy and labor markets. Characterization of the debate in the minutes could indicate how firm opinions are about the state of the U.S., and how confident members are that inflation and employment will move towards the Fed's target levels.

Investors will look for comments on recovery at the Gap brand and performance in the current quarter.      On Wednesday, teen apparel retailer American Eagle Outfitters Inc is expected to report second-quarter profit and sales above analysts' average estimates.

571,"   By Nathan Layne  Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) reported weaker quarterly earnings and lowered its annual forecast on Tuesday, as it copes with higher labor costs, a squeeze on pharmacy margins and sliding sales at its British supermarket chain. Shares of the world's largest retailer fell 3 percent to $69.75 after trading at its lowest in 2-1/2 years.The results showed how a move to lift wages and other costs have kept Wal-Mart from taking full advantage of a strengthening U.S. economy, although there was a bright spot in its report: a fourth straight quarter of same-store sales growth.    Net profit attributable to Wal-Mart fell to $3.48 billion, or $1.08 per share, in the second quarter ended July 31, from $3.92 billion, or $1.21, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected $1.12 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Wal-Mart lowered its forecast for the year ending in January to a range of $4.40 to $4.70 from its outlook of $4.70 to $5.05 in February. The consensus was for $4.77 per share.The significant cut to the forecast, even as Wal-Mart logged a 1.5 percent increase in comparable sales at U.S. stores open at least a year, highlighted a growing problem with controlling costs, said Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough. ""It was a big drop,"" said Yarbrough, referring to its revised forecast, which included 24 cents a share to pay for higher wages, training and additional worker hours. ""I question whether they will even be able to grow earnings next year.""In February Wal-Mart had flagged it would spend $1 billion on higher pay and for training, which will weigh on earnings this year. It also warned of higher spending to boost its e-commerce infrastructure as it seeks to close the online gap with Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), which recently passed the Arkansas-based retailer in market value.      But on Tuesday Wal-Mart said costs to increase worker hours beyond the February plan, as it tries to improve customer service with faster checkouts and better-stocked shelves, were denting earnings more than anticipated. It also said reduced reimbursement rates from pharmacy benefit managers were hurting margins in its U.S. pharmacy business and that wider healthcare insurance coverage generally had led to fewer higher-margin cash transactions on drugs.Another problem is increasing ""shrink,"" a retail industry term for losses tied to various issues including theft.A stronger dollar took a toll on its international business, which suffered a 14 percent fall in operating income in the quarter. Same-store sales at Asda, the UK grocery arm, declined 4.7 percent, the worst quarterly performance in the 16 years it has been owned by Wal-Mart. In one upbeat note, the 1.5 percent increase in same-store U.S. sales beat the consensus for a 1.0 percent rise, according to analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix. Sam's Club, its wholesale club store division that competes with Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O), achieved same-store sales growth of 1.3 percent, excluding the impact of fuel. Chief Financial Officer Charles Holley told an earnings conference call that while lower gasoline prices helped drive sales, the bulk of the gains were due to increased investments in its stores as well as in wages and training.The retailer lowered its forecast for opening smaller-format stores, and now plans to open 160 to 170 Neighborhood Markets locations for the full year, down from 180 to 200.

575,"  (Repeats story with no change to text)By Nathan LayneCHICAGO Aug 18 The world's largest retailer has a drug problem.Wal-Mart Stores Inc said on Tuesday that lower margins in its pharmacy business had emerged as a drag on profits, as it gets paid less by drug plan managers and as fewer customers pay in cash, since Obamacare has increased the ranks of insured Americans.The company warned that the margin squeeze would continue for at least the remainder of the year, although a spokesman told Reuters the pharmacy business is profitable and that Wal-Mart has no plans to sell it or find a partner to share the risk.The disclosure comes as retailers weigh the merit of running drugstores on their own. In June, Wal-Mart rival Target Corp  agreed to sell its loss-making pharmacy division to CVS Health Corp in a deal that will see CVS operate the pharmacies in 1,600 Target stores. ""We feel the decision we've made to run our own pharmacies is right for our business and shareholders,"" spokesman Randy Hargrove said on Tuesday.Wal-Mart said its margins were being pinched by two factors: reduced reimbursement rates from pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, which administer drug plans for employers and insurers, as well as a drop in high-margin cash transactions. Wal-Mart lowered its full year earnings-per-share forecast to a range of $4.40 to $4.70 from $4.70 to $5.05.  The new forecast includes an 11 cent hit from lower pharmacy margins and other ""unplanned headwinds"" such as an increase in in-store theft.On an earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Charles Holley said the pharmacy margins were falling due to lower reimbursement on ""some of the main drugs"", without offering further details.Ross Muken, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said it is likely that Wal-Mart just concluded contract negotiations with a major PBM, such as Express Scripts Holding Corp or CVS, that resulted in lower rates. The trend was for lower rates, reflecting pressure on the healthcare industry overall to lower costs, he said. No one at CVS could be immediately reached for comment. A spokesman for Express Scripts declined to comment. The drop-off in cash transactions was likely due to more Wal-Mart customers being insured on the back of the Affordable Care Act, Muken said. That hurts margins because managed plans can negotiate lower prices than an individual who pays cash.PBMs, which manage pharmacy benefits on behalf of employers and healthcare plans, over the past decade or so have consolidated into three main players - Express Scripts, CVS and UnitedHealth Group. The government has blessed these mergers as one way to help rein in healthcare costs, since the big companies have tremendous negotiating power, said Morningstar analyst Vishnu Lekraj.Wal-Mart's pharmacy generates $19 billion a year in annual revenue, according to Evercore. That ranks as one of the largest drugstores in the United States, but Wal-Mart is still no match for the clout held by the top three PBMs, which collectively process about 70 percent of all prescriptions in the U.S., Lekraj said.""With that kind of power they have in hand, they can dictate what pricing is going to be for the most part,"" Lekraj said.

578,"   By Nathan Layne | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Aug 18 The world's largest retailer has a drug problem.Wal-Mart Stores Inc said on Tuesday that lower margins in its pharmacy business had emerged as a drag on profits, as it gets paid less by drug plan managers and as fewer customers pay in cash, since Obamacare has increased the ranks of insured Americans.The company warned that the margin squeeze would continue for at least the remainder of the year, although a spokesman told Reuters the pharmacy business is profitable and that Wal-Mart has no plans to sell it or find a partner to share the risk.The disclosure comes as retailers weigh the merit of running drugstores on their own. In June, Wal-Mart rival Target Corp  agreed to sell its loss-making pharmacy division to CVS Health Corp in a deal that will see CVS operate the pharmacies in 1,600 Target stores. ""We feel the decision we've made to run our own pharmacies is right for our business and shareholders,"" spokesman Randy Hargrove said on Tuesday.Wal-Mart said its margins were being pinched by two factors: reduced reimbursement rates from pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, which administer drug plans for employers and insurers, as well as a drop in high-margin cash transactions.Wal-Mart lowered its full year earnings-per-share forecast to a range of $4.40 to $4.70 from $4.70 to $5.05.  The new forecast includes an 11 cent hit from lower pharmacy margins and other ""unplanned headwinds"" such as an increase in in-store theft. On an earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Charles Holley said the pharmacy margins were falling due to lower reimbursement on ""some of the main drugs"", without offering further details.Ross Muken, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said it is likely that Wal-Mart just concluded contract negotiations with a major PBM, such as Express Scripts Holding Corp or CVS, that resulted in lower rates. The trend was for lower rates, reflecting pressure on the healthcare industry overall to lower costs, he said. No one at CVS could be immediately reached for comment. A spokesman for Express Scripts declined to comment. The drop-off in cash transactions was likely due to more Wal-Mart customers being insured on the back of the Affordable Care Act, Muken said. That hurts margins because managed plans can negotiate lower prices than an individual who pays cash.PBMs, which manage pharmacy benefits on behalf of employers and healthcare plans, over the past decade or so have consolidated into three main players - Express Scripts, CVS and UnitedHealth Group. The government has blessed these mergers as one way to help rein in healthcare costs, since the big companies have tremendous negotiating power, said Morningstar analyst Vishnu Lekraj.Wal-Mart's pharmacy generates $19 billion a year in annual revenue, according to Evercore.

579,"   By Nathan Layne  Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), the United States' top seller of guns and ammunition, said on Wednesday it would stop selling the AR-15 and other semi-automatic rifles because of sluggish demand and focus instead on ""hunting and sportsman firearms.""Wal-Mart said the decision was unrelated to high-profile incidents involving the rifles, including the killing of 26 students and adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in 2012. ""This is done solely on what customer demand was,"" said company spokesman Kory Lundberg. ""We are instead focusing on hunting and sportsman firearms.""Lundberg said Wal-Mart would stop selling a class of rifle called the modern sporting rifle (MSR), which includes the semi-automatic AR-15. He said that class of rifle was sold in fewer than a third of its roughly 4,500 U.S. stores. The announcement came on the same day two television journalists were shot and killed in Virginia in an incident that is likely to stoke the debate about gun ownership in the United States. Retail consultant Burt Flicking saw the move as part of a shift at Wal-Mart under Chief Executive Doug McMillon to pay closer attention to public opinion on social issues, noting the company had raised wages for entry-level staff ealier this year.He was skeptical that it had been driven solely by demand, given generally solid sales of guns and ammunition in the United States. ""It shows that the Wal-Mart of this decade is quite different from the prior four decades,"" Flickinger said. Wal-Mart recently came under pressure from New York City's Trinity Church, an investor pushing for tighter oversight of sales of guns with high-capacity magazines.

The company's shares fell as much as 4.8 percent to $73 in early trading on Thursday.Dollar General slipped from the No.1 spot after it lost a takeover battle for smaller rival Family Dollar Stores Inc to Dollar Tree Inc this year. The deal closed on July 6.Family Dollar and Dollar Tree together have 13,600 stores. Dollar General, which mainly sells lower-margin food and household products, had about 12,198 stores.

Toys are an especially big focus for retailers this year, ahead of the December release of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" - the first in a new ""Star Wars"" trilogy being produced by Walt Disney Co.Wal-Mart said it will have 500 new Star Wars products in stores on Sept 4, as part of a global roll-out of movie-related merchandise at various retailers. Wal-Mart will make thousands more items, including apparel, grocery and health products, available online. Wal-Mart hopes the layaway program will ease purchases of Star Wars items, as well as other toys featured during a week-long toy promotion. Besides starting layaway earlier, it is reducing the minimum price for eligible items to $10 from $15 on a minimum basket of $50. ""In the five years we've been offering this holiday layaway program we've discovered that customers use it for a whole host of reasons, from being able to better budget their money and avoiding credit card fees,"" Kehoe said. Layaway programs can have a sizeable impact on a retailer's sales. Retail consultant Burt Flickinger estimates layaway can account for as much as 10 to 15 percent of holiday revenues at Wal-Mart stores in poorer areas.Wal-Mart said it would hold midnight Star Wars events at 2,900 stores on Sept 4 and family events at the same number of stores the following day. Kehoe said she expected strong demand for toys from collectors, besides children. Helped by the Star Wars launch, the U.S. toy industry is poised to grow 6.2 percent in 2015 to $19.9 billion, according to research by the NPD Group tracking about 80 percent of U.S. retail sales.

587,"   By Nathan Layne  Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) said it would reopen in late October to early November five U.S. stores whose closure had prompted a union to file a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, claiming the retailer was retaliating against workers for organizing.Wal-Mart will start hiring for the stores in Texas, Oklahoma, Florida and California, and will encourage previous employees and those that transferred to other stores to apply, company spokesman Lorenzo Lopez said on Wednesday.Wal-Mart announced the store closures in April to fix plumbing and other repairs. The move impacted some 2,200 workers and the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW), which backs campaigns pushing the retailer to improve pay and benefits for store employees, filed a complaint to the NLRB that is still pending. In the complaint the UFCW accused Wal-Mart of using plumbing problems as an excuse to close a store in Pico Rivera, California, in retaliation against workers there who have been active in attempts to organize for better pay and benefits. The other four stores were included as cover, the union claimed. Wal-Mart has denied the claims, saying the repairs were necessary and extensive.“We are moving forward with the process to reopen all five stores. While we continue to conduct plumbing repairs and store upgrades, our goal is to begin serving customers by late October or early November,"" Lorenzo said. Wal-Mart offered workers 60 days' pay and opportunities to transfer to other stores, with nearly three-fourths of those that sought a transfer granted an offer for one. For workers hired back to the same job at the reopening stores, Wal-Mart said it would guarantee the same rate of pay or higher.UFCW Jessica Levin spokeswoman said the union wants workers to be reinstated without any application process. She said the union would hold an event to press for this and other demands at the Pico Rivera store on Sept. 10. ""If it is true that the stores were closed for 'plumbing problems,' why is Walmart not reinstating the hard-working men and women that made that store a success in the first place?,"" Levin said in an emailed statement.The union's claim is still being investigated by a regional director at the NLRB to determine if it has merit, said agency spokeswoman Jessica Kahanek.

593,"  Unions filed a second labor board complaint against Wal-Mart Stores Inc related to its temporary closure of a California store, claiming the retailer discriminated against activist workers by not transferring them to nearby stores. The retailer says the closure of the California store - and four others at the center of the first complaint - was justified by the need for extensive repairs. It says it has offered 75 percent of employees who sought a transfer an opportunity to do so.The United Food & Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW), the AFL-CIO and an organization of Wal-Mart workers submitted the latest complaint to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) on Thursday, a spokeswoman for the UFCW said.The ongoing dispute dates back to April, when Wal-Mart closed five stores in Texas, Oklahoma, Florida and California citing the need for extensive plumbing and other repairs, affecting some 2,200 workers. In its original complaint, the unions accused Wal-Mart of using the repairs as an excuse to close a store in Pico Rivera, California, in retaliation against workers there who have been active in attempts to organize for better pay and benefits. The other four stores were included as cover, they claimed.In the second complaint, the unions claim that Wal-Mart had not offered to transfer the most vocal of the workers at the Pico Rivera store, a retaliation that it says is in violation of U.S. labor law. ""Wal-Mart has furthermore indicated that it will not rehire those employees who stood up and engaged in protected concerted activity when the Pico Rivera store reopens,"" the labor groups wrote in the complaint.Wal-Mart says it has been contacting former employees for possible rehiring as it prepares to re-open the stores. ""We're now going through the hiring process to reopen our stores by the end of October or early November. Our goal is to rehire as many high performing associates as possible so we can serve our customers in these communities,"" said Wal-Mart spokesman Brian Nick.

599,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, September 17 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.'s  (Walmart) Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'AA' and Short-term IDR and  commercial paper (CP) ratings at 'F1+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS Walmart's ratings reflect its substantial scale, dominant market position in  North America, low cyclicality, meaningful free cash flow (FCF; CFO less capex  less dividends), and relatively steady financial leverage, despite a history of  partially financing share repurchases with debt. Walmart's success is enabled by  its significant buying power, everyday low-price strategy, broad selection of  grocery and general merchandise, and operating efficiency.  These factors are balanced by the negative impact that the continued pressure on  low-income consumers, competition from hard discounters, dollar stores, and  on-line retailers, and low inflation is having on comparable store sales (comp)  performance. Key rating drivers include the on-going comp performance and market  share trends, near-term pressure on operating income and margins, and the  maintenance of relatively stable credit metrics.  Gradually Improving Comps: Walmart's strategy to improve comps includes  continuing to lead on price, enhancing merchandise assortments, and investing in  store labor and e-commerce to further improve its competitiveness and the  customer shopping experience. Fitch believes Walmart is making progress with its  efforts, as comps for Walmart U.S. have been positive for four straight  quarters; rising 1.5% in the quarter ended July 31, 2015, due mainly to traffic  which increased 1.3%. Walmart U.S. comps were relatively flat at 0.5% for the  year in 2014, after declining 0.6% for the year in 2013. Fitch expects comps to  approximate 1%-2% over the next 24 months and views comp growth above 2% as  optimistic given Walmart's existing market penetration and the increased price  competitiveness of dollar stores and supermarkets, many of which have narrowed  their price gap to Walmart.    Near-term Margin Pressure: Fitch expects Walmart's EBITDA margin to fall below  7% by 2016, down from 7.5% in 2014 as the company continues to invest in labor  in the U.S. and e-commerce worldwide. Walmart invested more than $1 billion to  raise the minimum wage for U.S. associates to $9/hour in April and plans to  increase it to at least $10/hour by February 2016. The company also added new  department manager positions to improve customer service. Pharmacy reimbursement  pressure along with increased inventory shrink are also pressuring margins in  the U.S. Operating margins at Walmart U.S. contracted 80 basis points (bps) to  6.6% during the six months ended July 31, 2015, after narrowing 40 bps to 7.4%  in 2014.  Stable Credit Metrics: Walmart has maintained relatively stable credit metrics,  even during periods of soft sales and margin pressure, and debt-financed share  repurchases. Adjusted debt/EBITDAR has remained around 2x and EBITDAR/interest  plus rents in the 7x-8x range over the past five years.  For the LTM period  ended July 31, 2015, total adjusted debt/EBITDAR was 1.9x and EBITDAR/interest  plus rents was 6.9x. Fitch expects Walmart's leverage to remain in line with  historical levels over the next 24-36 months. Total debt was $49.1 billion at  July 31, 2015, down from $56.6 billion at Jan. 31, 2014.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Walmart include: --Total revenue is flat in 2015 (fiscal year ended January 2016) as an  approximate 2% increase in retail square footage and 1% comp growth is offset by  a negative 3% impact from currency; thereafter, revenue grows at 3% annually  with comps up 1.5%.  --EBITDA margin declines 50 bps to 7% in 2015, an additional 30 bps in 2016, and  then expands slightly thereafter.  --FCF after dividends approximates $5 billion- $6 billion annually. --Adjusted leverage approximates 2x over the forecast horizon, with EBITDA  growth offset by increased debt levels to fund share buybacks.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive Rating Action: An upgrade is unlikely, given the rating is currently at  the high end of the rating spectrum and fully captures the company's financial  and qualitative strengths. Negative Rating Action: Future developments that may, individually or  collectively, lead to negative rating action include persistently weak comp  store sales, higher than expected margin pressure, or adjusted leverage  sustained above the 2x range due to debt-financed share buybacks concurrent with  weak operating performance.  LIQUIDITY Walmart had over $17 billion of liquidity including revolver availability and  readily available cash. Fitch defines readily available cash as reported cash,  which totalled $5.8 billion at July 31, 2015, less overseas cash of $1.2 billion  and operational cash of $650 million. Walmart has an undrawn $9 billion 364-day  revolver expiring in June 2016 and an undrawn $6 billion revolver expiring in  June 2020, which back up its $20 billion CP program. Fitch expects Walmart to  generate FCF of $5 billion-$6 billion annually, in line with its historical  average, over the next several years.  FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'AA';  --Senior unsecured debt at 'AA'; --Bank credit facility at 'AA'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1+'; --Commercial paper at 'F1+'.

600,"  NEW YORK, Sept 17 Wal-Mart Stores Inc  said it plans to hire 60,000 seasonal employees to work at its stores in the United States, the same as last year, as it gets ready for the busy holiday selling season.The world's largest retailer will pay temporary employees a starting rate of at least $9 per hour, as it tries to improve customer service with faster checkouts and better-stocked shelves at its 4,588 U.S. stores.In February, Wal-Mart said it would raise entry-level wages to $9 an hour, a 24 percent increase from the U.S. minimum wage that some employees now earn, after succumbing to longstanding pressure to pay its workforce more.The company said the increases would cost it $1 billion and impact about 40 percent of its workforce, although the hike fell short of what some labor groups have been agitating for. ""So this year we have more associates working more hours in our stores than last year, so while the holiday hiring number is flat, we do have more people in the stores taking care of customers,"" Kory Lundberg, a company spokesman said in an email.Current workers will be given the first opportunity to pick up additional hours, Wal-Mart said in an emailed statement. The company also said it was adding department managers in more than 3,500 stores for the holidays to specifically serve customers coming for in-store pick ups of online orders.

604,"   By Nathan Layne and Nandita Bose | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) is seeking price cuts from suppliers that produce goods in China, saying the retailer should share in the savings generated by China's devaluation of the yuan, people with knowledge of the matter said.Wal-Mart managers in recent weeks have contacted more than 10,000 suppliers in various countries, all of which have manufacturing facilities in China, seeking cost cuts of 2 percent to 6 percent on mainly general merchandise including home furnishings, apparel, health and beauty products, appliances, electronics and toys, according to a consultant who advised Wal-Mart on the move and spoke on condition of anonymity to protect his relationship with the retailer. The company is telling suppliers that they should pass on the savings arising from the yuan devaluation so Wal-Mart can achieve EDLC, or ""everyday low cost,"" its term for the tight cost controls needed to keep prices low for consumers, according to executives at two vendors of durable goods, who also requested anonymity. Both were asked for cuts in the lower half of the 2 percent to 6 percent range. Both said they planned to negotiate a reduction in the proposed cuts.    Wal-Mart spokeswoman Deisha Barnett declined to comment on whether the company was seeking price cuts in China-made goods. With almost $500 billion in annual sales and a globally diversified supply chain, Wal-Mart holds tremendous sway over its vendors, which could risk their business with the retailer by pushing back too hard on its requests to lower costsThe move by the world's largest retailer follows efforts by other retailers to benefit from a cheaper yuan. A senior Toys R Us official told Reuters last month that the company was ""engaging"" with suppliers about improving terms. Home Depot Inc (HD.N) Chief Financial Officer Carol Tome said they had identified potential cost savings from the currency's decline and would pursue them.Last month, China devalued its tightly controlled currency in a bid to boost growth and help flagging exports. The nearly 2 percent cut on Aug. 11 was the most significant downward adjustment to the yuan since 1994. The currency is down 2.9 percent versus the dollar so far this year, making exports from the country less expensive when purchased with dollars, the currency most often used in supplier contracts.     Wal-Mart's latest overture to suppliers comes as it seeks to push through broader changes designed to lower its costs through changes to vendor agreements. In June, Wal-Mart began asking all suppliers to pay fees to store inventory in Wal-Mart warehouses and in some cases has sought to extend the time Wal-Mart takes to pay its vendors.

605,"   By Nathan Layne and Nandita Bose | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) is seeking price cuts from suppliers that produce goods in China, saying the retailer should share in the savings generated by China's devaluation of the yuan, people with knowledge of the matter said.Wal-Mart managers in recent weeks have contacted more than 10,000 suppliers in various countries, all of which have manufacturing facilities in China, seeking cost cuts of 2 percent to 6 percent on mainly general merchandise including home furnishings, apparel, health and beauty products, appliances, electronics and toys, according to a consultant who advised Wal-Mart on the move and spoke on condition of anonymity to protect his relationship with the retailer. The company is telling suppliers that they should pass on the savings arising from the yuan devaluation so Wal-Mart can achieve EDLC, or ""everyday low cost,"" its term for the tight cost controls needed to keep prices low for consumers, according to executives at two vendors of durable goods, who also requested anonymity. Both were asked for cuts in the lower half of the 2 percent to 6 percent range. Both said they planned to negotiate a reduction in the proposed cuts.Wal-Mart spokeswoman Deisha Barnett declined to comment on whether the company was seeking price cuts in China-made goods. With almost $500 billion in annual sales and a globally diversified supply chain, Wal-Mart holds tremendous sway over its vendors, which could risk their business with the retailer by pushing back too hard on its requests to lower costsThe move by the world's largest retailer follows efforts by other retailers to benefit from a cheaper yuan. A senior Toys R Us official told Reuters last month that the company was ""engaging"" with suppliers about improving terms. Home Depot Inc (HD.N) Chief Financial Officer Carol Tome said they had identified potential cost savings from the currency's decline and would pursue them.Last month, China devalued its tightly controlled currency in a bid to boost growth and help flagging exports. The nearly 2 percent cut on Aug. 11 was the most significant downward adjustment to the yuan since 1994. The currency is down 2.9 percent versus the dollar so far this year, making exports from the country less expensive when purchased with dollars, the currency most often used in supplier contracts.  Wal-Mart's latest overture to suppliers comes as it seeks to push through broader changes designed to lower its costs through changes to vendor agreements. In June, Wal-Mart began asking all suppliers to pay fees to store inventory in Wal-Mart warehouses and in some cases has sought to extend the time Wal-Mart takes to pay its vendors. Wal-Mart has been struggling to shore up its profit margins, which have been weighed down by a $1 billion investment announced earlier this year to increase wages for half a million store-level workers and other cost pressures. The company's stock is down 26 percent so far this year.Barnett said the new vendor agreements are aimed at making its terms more consistent across suppliers, and were part of its efforts to keep prices low at the store.

606,"  Wal-Mart Stores Inc is expanding free grocery pickup service to several markets in the U.S. as it seeks to capitalize on its network of physical stores amid growing competition with Amazon.com and others investing in home delivery.The world's largest retailer said on Tuesday that it would start offering curbside pickup for groceries ordered online in eight new markets this month - including Atlanta and Salt Lake City - with more to be added in the coming weeks.Wal-Mart has been testing online grocery delivery services in two markets and pickup in the five markets of Denver, Phoenix, San Jose, California, Bentonville, Arkansas, and Huntsville, Alabama. Tuesday's announcement solidifies a strategy of playing to its bricks-and-mortar footprint, with an estimated 70 percent of the U.S. population living within five miles of one of its 4,600 stores. ""We are not walking away from delivery,"" said Michael Bender, Chief Operating Officer of global e-commerce at Wal-Mart. ""But right now the focus for us is pickup, driven largely by what our customers are telling us."" The move comes as rivals attempt to find the right business model for tapping demand for pickup and delivery services.Target Corp this month partnered with Instacart Inc to deliver groceries for $3.99 per order in a pilot offering in Minneapolis. Amazon.com Inc is testing delivery in Seattle, New York, Philadelphia and California, for a $299 annual fee.Bender said Wal-Mart is targeting pickup in part because it allows customers to pinpoint a pickup time, rather than having to be at home at a set delivery time of fresh items. He cited a busy mother with children as an example of the type of customer that would benefit from the service. Shoppers can choose from about 30,000 items, roughly the same assortment as in stores. After ordering and paying online, customers drive to the outlet at a designated time and workers load items into their cars. Fayetteville and Charlotte, North Carolina; Ogden, Utah; Nashville, Tennessee; Tucson, Arizona; and Colorado Springs, Colorado are the other new markets for the service. Wal-Mart will add a new role of ""personal shopper"" to retrieve and store the items. In some cases, that will entail promoting workers within a store, but overall it expected to add some headcount related to the service, Bender said. Neil Stern, senior partner at retail consultancy McMillan-Doolittle, said investing in pick-up makes sense from a cost perspective.""The economics of pick-up are much better for a retailer. Delivering to the home remains costly, even as services like Instacart and Shipt attempt to reinvent the model,"" Stern said.

617,"  BANGKOK Oct 5 Environmental activist group Greenpeace on Monday urged the world's largest manufacturer of canned tuna, Thai Union Group Pcl, to free its supply chains of destructive fishing practices and alleged labour abuses.It warned Thai Union, which makes the U.S. ""Chicken of the Sea"" brand and counts Wal-Mart and Costco Wholesale Corp among buyers, that the fishing methods it and its suppliers employ have serious environmental impacts and carry reputational risks.The Greenpeace action comes as Thailand faces pressure from the European Union to clean up illegal fishing practices or face a trade ban.It could also jeopardize Thai Union's plan to acquire U.S. rival Bumble Bee, which awaits approval from U.S. antitrust authorities.Greenpeace said it would work to make ""every single customer"" aware of the alleged abuses, until Thai Union took responsibility and demonstrated real leadership. ""We can no longer allow Thai Union Group and its brands around the world, including Chicken of the Sea, to sacrifice the world's oceans and jeopardize workers at sea,"" Greenpeace official Graham Forbes said in a statement.Greenpeace said two fishing methods primarily used by Thai Union result in by-catch, or fish that was not targeted but caught inadvertently, and are often associated with illegal fishing and rights violations.Thai Union, formerly known as Thai Union Frozen Products Pcl, said in a statement it was committed to responsible sourcing and legal compliance to ensure all supply chains were treated with respect and human rights upheld. ""We call on Greenpeace to enter into an open and transparent dialogue with Thai Union so that together we can work towards achieving our shared objectives,"" it said.Thailand, the world's third-largest seafood exporter, was given six months by the EU in April to address issues such as ensuring all fishing vessels were registered, had registered equipment and were fitted with a Vessel Monitoring System. Labour abuses in the Thai fishing industry are well-documented. Since 2014, the United States has put Thailand on the bottom-ranked Tier 3 in its annual Trafficking in Persons report.In its 2015 TIP report the U.S. State Department said some Thai and migrant workers were subjected to forced labour on Thai fishing boats with some remaining at sea for several years or paid very little or were threatened and beaten.The commission will decide in December whether Thailand's seafood exports should be blacklisted.Brussels also warned Taiwan last week that it was not doing enough to tackle illegal fishing.

618,"   By Nathan Layne and Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) on Friday named a new chief financial officer and installed a chief merchant, marking the latest shuffling of its management ranks as the retailer grapples with sluggish earnings.The world's largest retailer by revenue said 47-year-old Brett Biggs, who runs the finances of company's international division, would take over the CFO role from Charles Holley, 59, who will retire from the job at the end of the year.In a separate release it said Steve Bratspies, who has been in charge of food, was appointed chief merchandising officer, a key role deciding what and how Wal-Mart will sell items at its 4,500 U.S. stores. Bratspies fills a position left vacant for a year following the departure of Duncan Mac Naughton before the holiday season last year. He starts on Oct. 19.The moves mark the latest in a series of shuffles of top posts under Chief Executive Doug McMillon, who has been reshaping the retailer since taking the helm 18 months ago. Last week McMillon unveiled plans to cut 450 jobs at its headquarters in Arkansas in an effort to ""become a more nimble organization.""In a note to clients, Goldman Sachs noted that the CFO change followed ""persistent declines in earnings estimates"" and said ""investors have been looking for significant changes at the company."" McMillon and other top executives are scheduled to address analysts and investors at an annual meeting next week.Wal-Mart's shares were trading down 0.4 percent at $66.63 on the New York Stock Exchange.    Wal-Mart faces tough competition on various fronts, from the relentless expansion of online leader Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) to regional supermarkets fighting for a piece of Wal-Mart's grocery business, which accounts for more than half of its U.S. sales.   In August, Wal-Mart reported profit below estimates for the second quarter and cut its annual profit forecast, with margins weighed down by its $1 billion investment to boost workers' wages and other cost pressures.The company also announced last month it had found a ""material weakness"" in its controls over accounting for leases, though it said any adjustments to its financial statements would be immaterial.As CFO Holley has responsibility for accounting and control at Wal-Mart. The company did not mention the accounting issue in announcing the CFO change.    It said Holley, who has been CFO since December 2010, had elected to retire. McMillon said Holley oversaw ""a period of immense company growth and change"" and that he played a key role in ""driving significant shareholder returns.""Holley will be replaced by Biggs, who has worked in all of the retailer's three major divisions since joining the company in 2000. Biggs has been international CFO since January 2014 and was previously CFO of the U.S. operations and held senior positions in the Sam's Club warehouse division before that.One focus for investors will be whether Biggs looks to re-allocate capital from international operations, which are delivering much weaker returns than the U.S. business, said Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough. Yarbrough said he is also keen to see if Wal-Mart resumes a more active stance on share buybacks after scaling back significantly the past two years.

619,"  (Adds analyst comments, details on changes)By Nathan Layne and Sruthi RamakrishnanOct 9 Wal-Mart Stores Inc on Friday named a new chief financial officer and installed a chief merchant, marking the latest shuffling of its management ranks as the retailer grapples with sluggish earnings.The world's largest retailer by revenue said 47-year-old Brett Biggs, who runs the finances of company's international division, would take over the CFO role from Charles Holley, 59, who will retire from the job at the end of the year.In a separate release it said Steve Bratspies, who has been in charge of food, was appointed chief merchandising officer, a key role deciding what and how Wal-Mart will sell items at its 4,500 U.S. stores. Bratspies fills a position left vacant for a year following the departure of Duncan Mac Naughton before the holiday season last year. He starts on Oct. 19.The moves mark the latest in a series of shuffles of top posts under Chief Executive Doug McMillon, who has been reshaping the retailer since taking the helm 18 months ago. Last week McMillon unveiled plans to cut 450 jobs at its headquarters in Arkansas in an effort to ""become a more nimble organization.""In a note to clients, Goldman Sachs noted that the CFO change followed ""persistent declines in earnings estimates"" and said ""investors have been looking for significant changes at the company."" McMillon and other top executives are scheduled to address analysts and investors at an annual meeting next week. Wal-Mart's shares were trading down 0.4 percent at $66.63 on the New York Stock Exchange.Wal-Mart faces tough competition on various fronts, from the relentless expansion of online leader Amazon.com Inc to regional supermarkets fighting for a piece of Wal-Mart's grocery business, which accounts for more than half of its U.S. sales.In August, Wal-Mart reported profit below estimates for the second quarter and cut its annual profit forecast, with margins weighed down by its $1 billion investment to boost workers' wages and other cost pressures.The company also announced last month it had found a ""material weakness"" in its controls over accounting for leases, though it said any adjustments to its financial statements would be immaterial. As CFO Holley has responsibility for accounting and control at Wal-Mart. The company did not mention the accounting issue in announcing the CFO change.It said Holley, who has been CFO since December 2010, had elected to retire. McMillon said Holley oversaw ""a period of immense company growth and change"" and that he played a key role in ""driving significant shareholder returns.""Holley will be replaced by Biggs, who has worked in all of the retailer's three major divisions since joining the company in 2000. Biggs has been international CFO since January 2014 and was previously CFO of the U.S. operations and held senior positions in the Sam's Club warehouse division before that. One focus for investors will be whether Biggs looks to re-allocate capital from international operations, which are delivering much weaker returns than the U.S. business, said Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough.Yarbrough said he is also keen to see if Wal-Mart resumes a more active stance on share buybacks after scaling back significantly the past two years.""It will be interesting to see how Brett navigates the ship. We are sailing in much different seas,"" Yarbrough said.Wal-Mart named a new chief merchant - a vital position at any retailer involving oversight of product and promotional strategies - just in time for the holiday season, which kicks off in earnest later this month.Bratspies joined Wal-Mart in 2005 and has held positions in marketing, grocery and general merchandise.

The postings didn't make clear the reason for selling the stakes - almost all of which account for 35 percent of the jointly owned outlets - and China Resources did not respond to phone calls and emailed requests seeking comment.The sale comes as Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, and other largely brick and mortar retailers face intense competition in China from fast-developing online rivals just as growth in the world's second-largest economy cools.Wal-Mart, France's Carrefour SA (CARR.PA) and Britain's Tesco PLC (TSCO.L) have all seen sales growth slip over the last five years in China, losing market share to local rivals, according to consumer analytics firm Kantar Worldpanel.

627,"   By Nathan Layne and Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Wal-Mart Stores Inc warned on Wednesday that higher wages as well as spending on e-commerce and lower prices would cut earnings per share as much as 12 percent next fiscal year, sparking the steepest one-day decline in the company's shares in 25 years.Wal-Mart faces tough competition on multiple fronts, from the relentless expansion of online leader Amazon.com Inc to dollar stores and supermarkets fighting for a piece of its grocery business. Its international operations are also under pressure with a stronger dollar eating into sales.Wal-Mart Chief Executive Doug McMillon said a $1.5 billion investment in wages and training, including raising the minimum store wage to $10 an hour from $9, were needed to improve customer service and would account for three-quarters of the expected 6 percent to 12 percent drop in earnings per share next year.Wal-Mart also announced a $20 billion share buyback but the drop in its share price wiped out close to the same amount in market value, and the 10 percent drop was the worst one-day percentage performance since January 1988.The decline in Wal-Mart shares pulled down the Dow Jones Industrial Average, accounting for a quarter of the 1 percent drop in the index.The world's largest retailer by revenue said it would  invest several billion dollars to lower prices over the next three years. That sparked worries of a price war, and shares of rivals including Target and Home Depot also fell.""We can deliver stronger financial performance in the short-term simply by running our core business better but that won’t be enough,"" Chief Executive Doug McMillon said at an investor meeting in New York.The company forecast earnings per share would grow 5-10 percent in the fiscal year ending in January 2019.Wal-Mart Stores said current fiscal full-year sales would be flat due to the stronger-than-anticipated impact of the dollar. It had previously forecast net sales growth of 1-2 percent for the current fiscal year ending January. ""The guidance is very disappointing,"" Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said. ""What if these investments don’t lead to better sales. That's the biggest question.""SLOWER STORE GROWTH Wal-Mart is spending $1.5 billion in higher wages and training next year. Greg Foran, head of the U.S. business, said Wal-Mart would add 3,500 managers in the United States to improve its curbside grocery pickup service. Wal-Mart also said it was adding curbside pickup for groceries ordered online to 10 new markets, including Dallas, Miami and Tulsa, bringing the total to 23. It will add another 20 markets early next year, expanding a service it believes capitalizes on its network of stores - something Amazon does not have - and will be a key driver of growth. The company is building out a network of warehouses to handle e-commerce, a costly move Wal-Mart sees as essential to stopping Amazon and other rivals from stealing its best customers.At the same time Wal-Mart projected slower growth in new stores, with 85-95 of the smaller Neighborhood Markets format planned for the fiscal year ending in January 2017, down from 160-170 planned for the current fiscal year. Supercenter openings would slow to 50-60 in fiscal 2017 from 60-70 this year.Price competition was one reason for the slower growth. Foran said that Wal-Mart could not compete with local grocers in some markets, a factor that has played into its scaled back expansion plans for smaller stores.“To be completely candid, when we are up against someone who is really good at supermarkets, frankly our fresh offering has not been on par with what it takes to win in those environments,"" Foran said.   It also is trying to spruce up neglected stores. Foran said that the percentage of stores which got a ""pass"" grade for cleanliness, speed and friendliness had risen to 67 percent from 17 percent at the beginning of the year. ""That is really only getting us to at best mediocrity. So that bar is now being moved up so that a whole bunch of stores that were green are now going to find themselves red but they’ve all been told that,” he said.Wal-Mart has been grappling with sluggish sales, leading investors to seek significant changes. Wal-Mart is controlled by the Walton family, whose wealth has taken a dramatic hit this year as shares have slid about 30 percent.The company announced a new chief financial officer and appointed a chief merchant last week.Wal-Mart's promise to spend billions keeping prices low, coming after attempts to wring more savings from its suppliers, raised concerns for other retailers as well.""Investors are anticipating a price war, and I agree with that assessment,"" Kurt Jetta, CEO of retail analytics firm TABS, said by email. ""These price wars never work for anyone. In fact, they weren’t working for Walmart even when they had an advantage over Target."" Shares of Home Depot fell 1.1 percent, and Target dropped 3.5 percent. Wal-Mart's shares closed down 10 percent at $60.03.

628,"  (Adds analysts' quotes, more background)By Lauren HirschOct 14 This year's largest initial public offering was priced at a discount, while the second's biggest was delayed, as payment processor First Data Corp and supermarket operator Albertsons Companies Inc faced a choppy market.Despite other companies, such as luxury department store operator Neiman Marcus Group Inc, delaying their listing, First Data and Albertsons had planned to press ahead with plans to price their IPOs on Wednesday. Investors have been giving most IPOs a cold reception since the stock market plunged in August.To go through with their IPOs, companies have had to discount them heavily to make them attractive to risk-averse investors. While some IPOs have proved to be good bargains based on how their shares have traded following their listing, the bruising experiences of many companies are expected to deter more IPO hopefuls in the near future. ""Since labor day, IPOs have priced on average 18 percent below the midpoint of their range, returning 16 percent for investors. In order to get those positive returns, prices are being slashed,"" said Kathleen Smith, a managing director at investment banking boutique Renaissance Capital LLC.Investors' reaction to First Data and Albertsons show that  more companies will likely hold back from launching IPOs or continue to discount them if they go ahead with them, Smith added.First Data, controlled by private equity firm KKR & Co LP , was hoping to raise as much as $3.7 billion. It raised $2.56 billion by selling 160 million shares at $16 per share, below its previously indicated $18 to $20 per share range. This gives the company a market capitalization of $14 billion and a value of $35 billion when debt is included. Albertsons, backed by buyout firm Cerberus Capital Management LP, decided to delay the pricing of its IPO. It was hoping to raise as much as $2 billion, but a disappointing Wal-Mart Stores Inc outlook on Wednesday weighed on investor sentiment and drove Albertsons peer Kroger Co's  shares down 3 percent on the day.Albertsons initially hoped the delay may last a day, but now sees it as unlikely that its IPO will price in the short term, at least not until markets become more favorable, according to one source familiar with the company's thinking who requested anonymity to discuss the deliberations. Albertsons did not respond to a request for comment. ""It is important to maintain momentum throughout the process. Companies that ride the momentum all the way usually get to the pricing they want,"" said Neil Dahr, who leads the capital markets practice group at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.First Data, Albertsons, and other private equity-owned companies have been keen to launch their IPOs so they can pay down some of the debt they were saddled with following their leveraged buyouts.Next week, Italian luxury carmaker Ferrari is scheduled to price its IPO in the United States in a range of between $48 and $52 per share, which could value the company at up to $9.8 billion.Earlier on Wednesday, mobile payments company Square Inc registered with U.S. regulators for its long-expected IPO, in a test of CEO Jack Dorsey's ability to take the company public even as grapples with a turnaround at Twitter Inc, which he also runs. The company has not disclosed a timeline for the offering.

631,"   By Caroline Valetkevitch  U.S. stocks fell on Wednesday as Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) skidded after issuing a weak profit forecast and as JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) slipped on disappointing results.The news added to worries about the outlook for U.S. earnings, with Standard & Poor's 500 profits forecast to have dropped more than 4 percent in the third quarter from a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data.After the market close, shares of Netflix (NFLX.O) fell 2.4 percent to $107.55 after the company reported U.S. subscriber additions below its own forecast. The shares were down about 12 percent shortly after the news.Separately, grocery operator Albertsons (ABS.N) postponed the pricing of its initial public offering amid weaker-than-expected demand from investors, people familiar with the matter told Reuters, while First Data Corp (FDC.N) priced the year's biggest IPO at a discount. During the regular session, Wal-Mart sank 10 percent to $60.03 in its biggest one-day percentage decline in years and its heaviest trading day since January 2009, after it forecast a drop of up to 12 percent in earnings per share in fiscal 2017.The decline erased roughly $22 billion off the retailer's market value, and the stock was the biggest drag on both the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500. Target Corp (TGT.N) was down 3.5 percent at $76.20, Sears Co Ltd (SHLD.O) fell 3.0 percent to $24.41, while the S&P 500 retail index .SPXRT dropped 1.2 percent.Data showing U.S. retail sales barely rose in September weighed on sector shares.

Its international operations are also under pressure with a stronger dollar eating into sales.Wal-Mart Chief Executive Doug McMillon said a $1.5 billion investment in wages and training, including raising the minimum store wage to $10 an hour from $9, were needed to improve customer service and would account for three-quarters of the expected 6 percent to 12 percent drop in earnings per share next year.Wal-Mart also announced a $20 billion share buyback but the drop in its share price wiped out close to the same amount in market value, and the 10 percent drop was the worst one-day percentage performance since January 1988.The decline in Wal-Mart shares pulled down the Dow Jones Industrial Average, accounting for a quarter of the 1 percent drop in the index.The world's largest retailer by revenue said it would  invest several billion dollars to lower prices over the next three years. That sparked worries of a price war, and shares of rivals including Target and Home Depot also fell.""We can deliver stronger financial performance in the short-term simply by running our core business better but that won't be enough,"" Chief Executive Doug McMillon said at an investor meeting in New York.The company forecast earnings per share would grow 5-10 percent in the fiscal year ending in January 2019. Wal-Mart Stores said current fiscal full-year sales would be flat due to the stronger-than-anticipated impact of the dollar. It had previously forecast net sales growth of 1-2 percent for the current fiscal year ending January.""The guidance is very disappointing,"" Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said. ""What if these investments don't lead to better sales. That's the biggest question.""SLOWER STORE GROWTH Wal-Mart is spending $1.5 billion in higher wages and training next year. Greg Foran, head of the U.S. business, said Wal-Mart would add 3,500 managers in the United States to improve its curbside grocery pickup service. Wal-Mart also said it was adding curbside pickup for groceries ordered online to 10 new markets, including Dallas, Miami and Tulsa, bringing the total to 23. It will add another 20 markets early next year, expanding a service it believes capitalizes on its network of stores - something Amazon does not have - and will be a key driver of growth.The company is building out a network of warehouses to handle e-commerce, a costly move Wal-Mart sees as essential to stopping Amazon and other rivals from stealing its best customers.At the same time Wal-Mart projected slower growth in new stores, with 85-95 of the smaller Neighborhood Markets format planned for the fiscal year ending in January 2017, down from 160-170 planned for the current fiscal year. Supercenter openings would slow to 50-60 in fiscal 2017 from 60-70 this year.Price competition was one reason for the slower growth. Foran said that Wal-Mart could not compete with local grocers in some markets, a factor that has played into its scaled back expansion plans for smaller stores.""To be completely candid, when we are up against someone who is really good at supermarkets, frankly our fresh offering has not been on par with what it takes to win in those environments,"" Foran said. It also is trying to spruce up neglected stores. Foran said that the percentage of stores which got a ""pass"" grade for cleanliness, speed and friendliness had risen to 67 percent from 17 percent at the beginning of the year.""That is really only getting us to at best mediocrity. So that bar is now being moved up so that a whole bunch of stores that were green are now going to find themselves red but they've all been told that,"" he said.Wal-Mart has been grappling with sluggish sales, leading investors to seek significant changes. Wal-Mart is controlled by the Walton family, whose wealth has taken a dramatic hit this year as shares have slid about 30 percent.The company announced a new chief financial officer and appointed a chief merchant last week.Wal-Mart's promise to spend billions keeping prices low, coming after attempts to wring more savings from its suppliers, raised concerns for other retailers as well.""Investors are anticipating a price war, and I agree with that assessment,"" Kurt Jetta, CEO of retail analytics firm TABS, said by email. ""These price wars never work for anyone. In fact, they weren't working for Walmart even when they had an advantage over Target.""Shares of Home Depot fell 1.1 percent, and Target  dropped 3.5 percent.Wal-Mart's shares closed down 10 percent at $60.03.(Reporting by Sruthi Ramakrishnan in Bengaluru and Nathan Layne in Chicago; additional reporting by David Gaffen; Editing by Anil D'Silva, Ted Kerr and Bernard Orr)",2015-10-14,WMT,"Wed Oct 14, 2015 | 5:13pm EDT","UPDATE 5-Wal-Mart warns on profit, stock has steepest decline in 25 yrs",http://www.reuters.com//article/wal-mart-shareholders-idUSL3N12E4F620151014?type=companyNews

The decline erased about $22 billion off the retailer's market value, and the stock was the biggest drag on both the Dow and S&P 500.Also weighing on retailers, data showed retail sales in the United States barely rose in September. Target was down 3.5 percent at $76.20, and Sears  fell 3.0 percent to $24.41.

637,"  (Corrects title of Kathleen Smith in paragraph 4 and spelling of name Dhar in paragraph 9)By Lauren HirschOct 14 This year's largest initial public offering was priced at a discount, while the second's biggest was delayed, as payment processor First Data Corp and supermarket operator Albertsons Companies Inc faced a choppy market.Despite other companies, such as luxury department store operator Neiman Marcus Group Inc, delaying their listing, First Data and Albertsons had planned to press ahead with plans to price their IPOs on Wednesday. Investors have been giving most IPOs a cold reception since the stock market plunged in August.To go through with their IPOs, companies have had to discount them heavily to make them attractive to risk-averse investors. While some IPOs have proved to be good bargains based on how their shares have traded following their listing, the bruising experiences of many companies are expected to deter more IPO hopefuls in the near future. ""Since labor day, IPOs have priced on average 18 percent below the midpoint of their range, returning 16 percent for investors. In order to get those positive returns, prices are being slashed,"" said Kathleen Smith, manager of IPO-focused ETFs at Renaissance Capital LLC.Investors' reaction to First Data and Albertsons show that  more companies will likely hold back from launching IPOs or continue to discount them if they go ahead with them, Smith added.First Data, controlled by private equity firm KKR & Co LP , was hoping to raise as much as $3.7 billion. It raised $2.56 billion by selling 160 million shares at $16 per share, below its previously indicated $18 to $20 per share range. This gives the company a market capitalization of $14 billion and a value of $35 billion when debt is included. Albertsons, backed by buyout firm Cerberus Capital Management LP, decided to delay the pricing of its IPO. It was hoping to raise as much as $2 billion, but a disappointing Wal-Mart Stores Inc outlook on Wednesday weighed on investor sentiment and drove Albertsons peer Kroger Co's  shares down 3 percent on the day.Albertsons initially hoped the delay may last a day, but now sees it as unlikely that its IPO will price in the short term, at least not until markets become more favorable, according to one source familiar with the company's thinking who requested anonymity to discuss the deliberations. Albertsons did not respond to a request for comment. ""It is important to maintain momentum throughout the process. Companies that ride the momentum all the way usually get to the pricing they want,"" said Neil Dhar, who leads the capital markets practice group at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.First Data, Albertsons, and other private equity-owned companies have been keen to launch their IPOs so they can pay down some of the debt they were saddled with following their leveraged buyouts.Next week, Italian luxury carmaker Ferrari is scheduled to price its IPO in the United States in a range of between $48 and $52 per share, which could value the company at up to $9.8 billion.Earlier on Wednesday, mobile payments company Square Inc registered with U.S. regulators for its long-expected IPO, in a test of CEO Jack Dorsey's ability to take the company public even as grapples with a turnaround at Twitter Inc, which he also runs. The company has not disclosed a timeline for the offering.

638,"   By James Saft  Big fish Chinese gamblers afraid of a corruption crackdown and poorly paid Walmart workers in the United States might seem to have little in common.But in the global economy, they are in some ways two sides of the same coin, and to understand that is to understand more than why the two disparate groups were blamed for horrendous earnings at two very different companies: Walmart and Wynn Resorts.The globalization of the past 25 years has been kind to both companies, as cheap labor from China became integrated in the global economy, creating, among many phenomena, great new wealth in China and a buyer’s market for labor in the United States.Now we may be seeing the early stages of a partial reversal of some of those trends, as China seeks a new economic model and politics and economics in the United States are giving wage earners more bargaining power.Walmart's stock is down more than 12 percent since it said on Wednesday that earnings would fall 6-12 percent this year, a decline it blamed in part on higher wage bills. The retailer said in April it was bumping hourly pay up to at least $9 for all U.S. employees, with another dollar-per-hour hike to come in February. Overall, Walmart says it will spend $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion on higher wages and training next year.Wynn Resorts has a very different species of problem: too few Chinese high-rollers willing to be seen betting fortunes on the flip of a card. Not only are more gamblers now in fear of a crackdown on corruption underway in China, but President Xi Jinping’s efforts are creating a hostile environment for casinos in formerly wide-open Macau.“In my 45 years of experience, I’ve never seen anything like this before,” Wynn CEO Steve Wynn said on Thursday, describing the difficulty of what he called an “almost mystical” planning process on the Chinese-administered island.Wynn Resorts said profits fell more than a dollar per share to just 86 cents, driven by a 38 percent fall in Macau revenue and a near halving of the VIP junket business that brings rich gamblers to the tables from the Chinese mainland. Wynn shares, down more than 50 percent thus far this year, fell sharply in Asian trading before recovering somewhat the following day in U.S. hours.BUSINESS MODELS Gambling in Macau, to be sure, is particularly vulnerable to a number of trends in China. Not only is an economic slowdown hitting the cash flow of those who gamble, but the corruption crackdown has taken particular aim at the industry. So-called junkets, short trips to Macau, are seen both as a symbol of corruption and a means for officials and others to launder cash or simply to evade Chinese capital controls.Still both businesses - Walmart and Wynn Resorts - had business models that were part beneficiaries of and partly predicated on long-running global trends. As China rose, integrating its huge and underutilized labor force into the global economy, its share of world trade rose from less than 3 percent in 1990 to 12 percent today.Great wealth was created, both in China and the rest of the world.Macau, gambling and Wynn all were beneficiaries of occupying an intermediate space between tightly controlled capital and the rest of the world. Gamblers had good reason not just to want to live a little, but to want to get a bit offshore.On the other side of the world, Walmart did well out of selling goods, many of them made in China, cheaply to a middle- and lower-income clientele whose incomes were being whittled away in real terms as U.S. manufacturing jobs went offshore. Those U.S. workers were both keen to find a bargain and, lacking better-paid options, willing to work for comparatively little.China now is at or past a demographic tipping point, with little excess labor to absorb. The plan instead: to move toward a more domestically focused, consumer-based economy. That change ultimately may be successful, but in the meantime China sees the need to crack down on arrangements and practices, like the junkets, that it previously tolerated.Walmart, conversely, finds itself also affected by the same mega-trend of an aging China. Not only has U.S. unemployment fallen, potentially giving workers more negotiating power, but after decades of falling real wages, the U.S. political debate has changed, with more pressure for higher minimum wages.In other words, as surplus labor supply dries up in China and elsewhere, largely for demographic reasons, business models everywhere will come under pressure. Lower margins are likely for labor-intensive U.S. companies, and the pie will be divided differently, with different winners and losers in China.(James Saft is a Reuters columnist.

640,"   By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Wal-Mart Stores Inc's (WMT.N) shares fell hard after the world's largest retailer cut its profit view for 2017 but some options traders were betting on a quick rebound.On Wednesday, the company warned that earnings per share will fall as much as 12 percent next fiscal year, sparking the steepest one-day decline in the company's shares in 25 years.While the falloff sent some looking for near-term protection, the hottest activity centered around traders betting on the shares climbing north of $65 by mid-January, a gain of more than 10 percent.On Wednesday, 19,500 of these contracts traded for an average price of 84 cents, according to Thomson Reuters data. Most of this flow appeared to be from options buyers opening new positions, said Fred Ruffy, strategist at options analytics firm Trade Alert. With open interest of 21,600 contracts these options represent the fourth-largest block of active options on the company's shares.Other heavily traded contracts included options betting on the shares rising above $60.00 and $62.50 by mid-January. Given that the stock appeared oversold some people may be betting on a bounce to pre-crash readings, said Scott Fullman, chief strategist at Revere Securities Corp.""I also believe that people are looking for alternatives to their stock positions,"" Fullman said. Some traders appeared to have sold stock and loaded up on call options instead as a way to reduce exposure to the stock's volatility while still being able to participate in gains if the shares rally hard.A quick rebound, however, would be uncharacteristic for the shares. The stock, which is down 31 percent in 2015, has in the past been slow to recover when falling sharply from a multi-year high.

641,"   By Lauren Hirsch  The year's biggest initial public offering ended with a whimper on Thursday, highlighting companies’ narrowing funding options as investors eschew risk.U.S. payment processing company First Data Corp, controlled by private equity firm KKR & Co LP, raised $2.56 billion in its stock market debut, a steep drop from the $3.7 billion originally targeted. Its shares ended down 1.6 percent.  Almost two months after a stock market rout injected volatility and risk aversion into the IPO market, private equity firms and venture capital investors face tough pricing choices in raising money for their companies or cashing out on their stakes. Cerberus Capital Management LP, the private equity firm that controls supermarket operator Albertsons Companies Inc,  decided it would be better to wait. It pulled what was expected to be one of the largest IPOs of the year as it was about to price on Wednesday, and will not relaunch it until the markets become more favorable.  To be sure, Albertsons also faced headwinds because of Wal-Mart Stores Inc, whose disappointing outlook weighed on investor sentiment and drove Albertsons peer Kroger Co's shares down.""We did successfully execute three IPOs in the last three weeks. So it is an environment where the markets are not closed, they are open from time to time for good companies,"" Michael Chae, chief financial officer of private equity firm Blackstone Group LP, told analysts on the company's third-quarter earnings call on Thursday. But the vast majority of companies that have gone ahead with their IPO since early September have had to discount or downsize their offerings and companies saddled with mountains of debt make investors nervous. Low interest rates have helped private equity firms to refinance their debt piles, easing pressure on them to take their companies public. But holding back from launching an IPO can also mean delaying returning money to private equity fund investors.

642,"  (Adds experts' comments, background on the industry)By Lauren HirschOct 15 The year's biggest initial public offering ended with a whimper on Thursday, highlighting companies' narrowing funding options as investors eschew risk.U.S. payment processing company First Data Corp, controlled by private equity firm KKR & Co LP, raised $2.56 billion in its stock market debut, a steep drop from the $3.7 billion originally targeted. Its shares ended down 1.6 percent.Almost two months after a stock market rout injected volatility and risk aversion into the IPO market, private equity firms and venture capital investors face tough pricing choices in raising money for their companies or cashing out on their stakes.Cerberus Capital Management LP, the private equity firm that controls supermarket operator Albertsons Companies Inc,  decided it would be better to wait. It pulled what was expected to be one of the largest IPOs of the year as it was about to price on Wednesday, and will not relaunch it until the markets become more favorable.To be sure, Albertsons also faced headwinds because of Wal-Mart Stores Inc, whose disappointing outlook weighed on investor sentiment and drove Albertsons peer Kroger Co's  shares down. ""We did successfully execute three IPOs in the last three weeks. So it is an environment where the markets are not closed, they are open from time to time for good companies,"" Michael Chae, chief financial officer of private equity firm Blackstone Group LP, told analysts on the company's third-quarter earnings call on Thursday.But the vast majority of companies that have gone ahead with their IPO since early September have had to discount or downsize their offerings and companies saddled with mountains of debt make investors nervous.Low interest rates have helped private equity firms to refinance their debt piles, easing pressure on them to take their companies public. But holding back from launching an IPO can also mean delaying returning money to private equity fund investors. Venture capital-backed companies valued at more than $3 billion may be under more pressure to go public, however, because they could find it difficult to raise further capital in the private markets while also meeting existing investors' valuation expectations.WHERE TO GET THE MONEY?

643,"  (Repeats to add headline slug)By James SaftOct 16 Big fish Chinese gamblers afraid of a corruption crackdown and poorly paid Wal-Mart workers in the United States might seem to have little in common.But in the global economy, they are in some ways two sides of the same coin, and to understand that is to understand more than why the two disparate groups were blamed for horrendous earnings at two very different companies: Wal-Mart and Wynn Resorts.The globalization of the past 25 years has been kind to both companies, as cheap labor from China became integrated in the global economy, creating, among many phenomena, great new wealth in China and a buyer's market for labor in the United States.Now we may be seeing the early stages of a partial reversal of some of those trends, as China seeks a new economic model and politics and economics in the United States are giving wage earners more bargaining power.Wal-Mart's stock is down more than 12 percent since it said on Wednesday that earnings would fall 6-12 percent this year, a decline it blamed in part on higher wage bills. The retailer said in April it was bumping hourly pay up to at least $9 for all U.S. employees, with another dollar-per-hour hike to come in February. Overall, Wal-Mart says it will spend $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion on higher wages and training next year. Wynn Resorts has a very different species of problem: too few Chinese high-rollers willing to be seen betting fortunes on the flip of a card. Not only are more gamblers now in fear of a crackdown on corruption underway in China, but President Xi Jinping's efforts are creating a hostile environment for casinos in formerly wide-open Macau.""In my 45 years of experience, I've never seen anything like this before,"" Wynn CEO Steve Wynn said on Thursday, describing the difficulty of what he called an ""almost mystical"" planning process on the Chinese-administered island.Wynn Resorts said profits fell more than a dollar per share to just 86 cents, driven by a 38 percent fall in Macau revenue and a near halving of the VIP junket business that brings rich gamblers to the tables from the Chinese mainland.Wynn shares, down more than 50 percent thus far this year, fell sharply in Asian trading before recovering somewhat the following day in U.S. hours. BUSINESS MODELS Gambling in Macau, to be sure, is particularly vulnerable to a number of trends in China. Not only is an economic slowdown hitting the cash flow of those who gamble, but the corruption crackdown has taken particular aim at the industry. So-called junkets, short trips to Macau, are seen both as a symbol of corruption and a means for officials and others to launder cash or simply to evade Chinese capital controls.Still both businesses - Wal-Mart and Wynn Resorts - had business models that were part beneficiaries of and partly predicated on long-running global trends. As China rose, integrating its huge and underutilized labor force into the global economy, its share of world trade rose from less than 3 percent in 1990 to 12 percent today. Great wealth was created, both in China and the rest of the world.Macau, gambling and Wynn all were beneficiaries of occupying an intermediate space between tightly controlled capital and the rest of the world. Gamblers had good reason not just to want to live a little, but to want to get a bit offshore.On the other side of the world, Wal-Mart did well out of selling goods, many of them made in China, cheaply to a middle- and lower-income clientele whose incomes were being whittled away in real terms as U.S. manufacturing jobs went offshore. Those U.S. workers were both keen to find a bargain and, lacking better-paid options, willing to work for comparatively little.China now is at or past a demographic tipping point, with little excess labor to absorb. The plan instead: to move toward a more domestically focused, consumer-based economy. That change ultimately may be successful, but in the meantime China sees the need to crack down on arrangements and practices, like the junkets, that it previously tolerated.Wal-Mart, conversely, finds itself also affected by the same mega-trend of an aging China. Not only has U.S. unemployment fallen, potentially giving workers more negotiating power, but after decades of falling real wages, the U.S. political debate has changed, with more pressure for higher minimum wages.In other words, as surplus labor supply dries up in China and elsewhere, largely for demographic reasons, business models everywhere will come under pressure. Lower margins are likely for labor-intensive U.S. companies, and the pie will be divided differently, with different winners and losers in China.

644,"   By Nathan Layne  Suppliers of everything from groceries to sports equipment are already being squeezed for price cuts and cost sharing by Wal-Mart Stores (WMT.N). Now they are bracing for the pressure to ratchet up even more after a shock earnings warning from the retailer last week.The discount store behemoth has always had a reputation for demanding lower prices from vendors but Reuters has learned from interviews with suppliers and consultants, as well as reviewing some contracts, that even by its standards Wal-Mart has been turning up the heat on them this year. ""The ground is shaking here,"" said Cameron Smith, head of Cameron Smith & Associates, a major recruiting firm for suppliers located close to Wal-Mart's headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas. ""Suppliers are going to have to help Wal-Mart get back on track.""      For the vendors, dealing with Wal-Mart has always been tough because of its size – despite recent troubles it still generates more than $340 billion of annual sales in the U.S. That accounts for more than 10 percent of the American retail market, excluding auto and restaurant sales, and the company increasingly sells a lot overseas too. To risk having brands kicked off Wal-Mart’s shelves because of a dispute over pricing can badly hurt a supplier.    On Wednesday, Wal-Mart stunned Wall Street by forecasting that its earnings would decline by as much as 12 percent in its next fiscal year to January 2017 as it struggles to offset rising costs from increases in the wages of its hourly-paid staff, improvements in its stores, and investments to grow online sales. This at a time when it faces relentless price competition from Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), dollar stores and regional supermarket chains.      Keeping the prices it pays suppliers as low as it can is essential if it is to start to claw back some of this cost hit to its margins.Helped by investments to spruce up stores and boost worker pay, Wal-Mart believes it can grow sales by 3 to 4 percent a year over the next three years, or by as much as $60 billion, offering suppliers new opportunities to boost their own revenues.     QUESTIONS NOT ALLOWED     The squeeze on suppliers was clear to those selling to Wal-Mart’s Sam’s Club warehouse clubs around April this year. Sam’s Club’s buyers summoned major vendors to meetings and told them a ""cost gap analysis"" showed they should be delivering at a lower price, and demanded millions of dollars in discounts on future purchases, according to emails reviewed by Reuters and interviews with suppliers and consultants involved in the talks.    Unlike in prior talks, which featured give and take, vendors were told they could not ask questions at the meetings, with queries to be handled later via email, according to suppliers and consultants involved in or briefed on the meetings. One food supplier, for example, eventually agreed to cut costs by a few percent, after being asked for a much larger reduction, people familiar with those talks said.Sam's Club said it is continually talking with suppliers in an effort to save costs and lower prices. Spokesman Bill Durling said the company, whose merchant teams are separate from those at the Walmart chain, had recently changed its structure so that one account head now manages the relationship across various products, with the ability to see across the work of multiple buyers. This was done with the aim of improving merchandise and wringing out efficiencies, he said.     ""There might be unpleasant conversations but ultimately we want to do right by our suppliers because we want to create strategic relationships,"" Durling said. ""We want them to be along with us for the ride as we continue to grow.” NEW FEES SOUGHT        In June, vendors to Walmart stores got word of sweeping changes to supplier agreements that seek to extend payment terms in some cases and introduced new fees to warehouse goods and place product in new stores. Then, in recent weeks, Wal-Mart told suppliers producing in China they should share any benefit gained from the decline in the value of the Chinese yuan.    Wal-Mart spokeswoman Deisha Barnett stressed that it sees its relationships with suppliers as critical to the company's success. ""We will work with every supplier to ensure that terms and agreements are mutually agreed upon,"" she said.     Wal-Mart has told suppliers the new terms are aimed at helping it keep prices low, applying fees more consistently across vendors and bringing its practices in line with industry norms. The charges to store goods in distribution centers and for delivery to new stores are common at other retailers but had not normally been the case at Wal-Mart.   The moves followed February’s announcement that Wal-Mart would hike the minimum pay rate for its workers to $9 an hour by April, and to $10 by February 2016. The first move is costing $1.2 billion this year and the second an additional $1.5 billion next year, including other labor costs, such as placing more department managers in stores. The additional expense for its workers is accounting for 75 percent of the projected earnings decline in fiscal 2017.    Chief Executive Doug McMillon, who became CEO 18 months ago, and other executives said they are seeing a payoff in the form of improved customer service.Greg Foran, head of the U.S. business, said on Wednesday  the company has assessed that two-thirds of its 4,500-plus stores now have a ""passing grade"" in problem areas - cleanliness, checkout speed, and other factors affecting customer satisfaction. That is up from just 16 percent in February.With its stores in better shape, Wal-Mart now is redoubling its focus on beating competitors on price. Over the next three years, the company said it would spend several billion dollars on keeping prices low.    Foran said vendors will benefit. ""We lower the cost of goods, which in turn generates savings and we invest that in price. Lower prices see an increase in traffic and basket, which in turn grows sales and gains share,"" Foran said. Late last year Wal-Mart broke a stretch of six straight quarters without growth in same-store U.S. sales, and logged a 1.5 percent gain in its second quarter ending in July. But that falls short of Target Inc’s (TGT.N) 2.4 percent growth, and Kroger’s (KR.N) 5.3 percent increase, excluding results from sales of gasoline.SLIPPERY SLOPE     Wednesday's announcement sent ripples through the supplier community in the Bentonville area, where more than 1,000 have offices to stay close to Wal-Mart.    ""Now we know why they have been pushing so hard,"" said an executive at a major consumer goods supplier to both Walmart and Sam's Club, adding that his team was shocked by the projected decline in profits. ""Maybe they were banking on more suppliers rolling over on the terms.""     Wal-Mart's success in boosting profits could hinge in large part on the willingness of suppliers to sign on to its new terms and agree to its price demands. Despite signs of resistance, one consumer goods supplier reckons most will eventually give in to Wal-Mart’s market power, though not without a fight. He pushed back after the retailer asked him for new terms that cut 2 percent off his annual sales. They settled on 1 percent, but he fears further demands down the road.“I just worry that this is a slippery slope of them going in this direction,"" he said.

645,"  LONDON Oct 19 Supermarket Asda, the British arm of Wal-Mart, is to accelerate investment in its larger stores and put expansion on hold elsewhere to save money as it seeks to reverse a sharp fall in recent sales.Britain's ""big four"" supermarkets, Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons, have been hurt by a price war as they attempt to stem the loss of shoppers to discounters Aldi and Lidl, and the impact of commodity-led deflation.Without providing new investment figures Asda said on Monday it would speed up existing plans to reconfigure 95 of its larger stores.But it will also slow down planned expansions in London, such as small format stores, as well as a programme to develop small outlets at petrol stations. Asda will put a brake on existing plans to develop remote click and collect sites, while non-core areas such as its business to business sales operation will permanently close in the next few months.""We need to simplify what we do by prioritising the first line of our strategy -- improving our core business - and pausing activity in other areas so that we are not spread too thinly,"" said Chief Executive Andy Clarke. All the big four supermarket groups have been lowering prices. But Asda was the first, saying in November 2013 it would spend 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion) on cuts over five years. In February, Asda separately said it would invest an additional 600 million pounds on stores this year.Asda's sales performance has deteriorated significantly in 2015, with the firm reporting like-for-like sales declines of 3.9 percent in its first quarter and 4.7 percent in its second quarter. The second quarter outcome, Asda's worst performance in the 16 years it has been owned by Wal-Mart, was described by Clarke as the firm's ""nadir"". However, recent industry data has shown little improvement.Last week Asda lured Roger Burnley, a top executive from rival Sainsbury's, to be its new chief operating officer, Clarke's deputy and his most likely successor as CEO.Separately last week Wal-Mart warned on profit, blaming higher spend on wages and e-commerce and lower prices, sending its shares down 10 percent.

This at a time when it faces relentless price competition from Amazon.com Inc, dollar stores and regional supermarket chains.Keeping the prices it pays suppliers as low as it can is essential if it is to start to claw back some of this cost hit to its margins.Helped by investments to spruce up stores and boost worker pay, Wal-Mart believes it can grow sales by 3 to 4 percent a year over the next three years, or by as much as $60 billion, offering suppliers new opportunities to boost their own revenues.QUESTIONS NOT ALLOWED The squeeze on suppliers was clear to those selling to Wal-Mart's Sam's Club warehouse clubs around April this year. Sam's Club's buyers summoned major vendors to meetings and told them a ""cost gap analysis"" showed they should be delivering at a lower price, and demanded millions of dollars in discounts on future purchases, according to emails reviewed by Reuters and interviews with suppliers and consultants involved in the talks.Unlike in prior talks, which featured give and take, vendors were told they could not ask questions at the meetings, with queries to be handled later via email, according to suppliers and consultants involved in or briefed on the meetings. One food supplier, for example, eventually agreed to cut costs by a few percent, after being asked for a much larger reduction, people familiar with those talks said.Sam's Club said it is continually talking with suppliers in an effort to save costs and lower prices. Spokesman Bill Durling said the company, whose merchant teams are separate from those at the Walmart chain, had recently changed its structure so that one account head now manages the relationship across various products, with the ability to see across the work of multiple buyers. This was done with the aim of improving merchandise and wringing out efficiencies, he said. ""There might be unpleasant conversations but ultimately we want to do right by our suppliers because we want to create strategic relationships,"" Durling said. ""We want them to be along with us for the ride as we continue to grow.""NEW FEES SOUGHT In June, vendors to Walmart stores got word of sweeping changes to supplier agreements that seek to extend payment terms in some cases and introduced new fees to warehouse goods and place product in new stores. Then, in recent weeks, Wal-Mart told suppliers producing in China they should share any benefit gained from the decline in the value of the Chinese yuan.Wal-Mart spokeswoman Deisha Barnett stressed that it sees its relationships with suppliers as critical to the company's success. ""We will work with every supplier to ensure that terms and agreements are mutually agreed upon,"" she said. Wal-Mart has told suppliers the new terms are aimed at helping it keep prices low, applying fees more consistently across vendors and bringing its practices in line with industry norms. The charges to store goods in distribution centers and for delivery to new stores are common at other retailers but had not normally been the case at Wal-Mart.The moves followed February's announcement that Wal-Mart would hike the minimum pay rate for its workers to $9 an hour by April, and to $10 by February 2016. The first move is costing $1.2 billion this year and the second an additional $1.5 billion next year, including other labor costs, such as placing more department managers in stores. The additional expense for its workers is accounting for 75 percent of the projected earnings decline in fiscal 2017.Chief Executive Doug McMillon, who became CEO 18 months ago, and other executives said they are seeing a payoff in the form of improved customer service.Greg Foran, head of the U.S. business, said on Wednesday  the company has assessed that two-thirds of its 4,500-plus stores now have a ""passing grade"" in problem areas - cleanliness, checkout speed, and other factors affecting customer satisfaction. That is up from just 16 percent in February.With its stores in better shape, Wal-Mart now is redoubling its focus on beating competitors on price. Over the next three years, the company said it would spend several billion dollars on keeping prices low.Foran said vendors will benefit. ""We lower the cost of goods, which in turn generates savings and we invest that in price. Lower prices see an increase in traffic and basket, which in turn grows sales and gains share,"" Foran said. Late last year Wal-Mart broke a stretch of six straight quarters without growth in same-store U.S. sales, and logged a 1.5 percent gain in its second quarter ending in July. But that falls short of Target Inc's 2.4 percent growth, and Kroger's 5.3 percent increase, excluding results from sales of gasoline.SLIPPERY SLOPE Wednesday's announcement sent ripples through the supplier community in the Bentonville area, where more than 1,000 have offices to stay close to Wal-Mart.""Now we know why they have been pushing so hard,"" said an executive at a major consumer goods supplier to both Walmart and Sam's Club, adding that his team was shocked by the projected decline in profits. ""Maybe they were banking on more suppliers rolling over on the terms.""Wal-Mart's success in boosting profits could hinge in large part on the willingness of suppliers to sign on to its new terms and agree to its price demands. Despite signs of resistance, one consumer goods supplier reckons most will eventually give in to Wal-Mart's market power, though not without a fight.He pushed back after the retailer asked him for new terms that cut 2 percent off his annual sales. They settled on 1 percent, but he fears further demands down the road.""I just worry that this is a slippery slope of them going in this direction,"" he said.(Reporting by Nathan Layne in Chicago; Aditional reporting by Tim Aeppel in New York; Editing by Martin Howell)",2015-10-19,WMT,"Mon Oct 19, 2015 | 1:00am EDT",INSIGHT-Wal-Mart puts the squeeze on suppliers to share its pain as earnings sag,http://www.reuters.com//article/wal-mart-suppliers-idUSL1N12G29Q20151019?type=companyNews

656,"   By Nathan Layne | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Wal-Mart Stores Inc applied Monday to U.S. regulators for permission to test drones for home delivery, curbside pickup and checking warehouse inventories, a sign it plans to go head-to-head with Amazon in using drones to fill and deliver online orders.  The world's largest retailer by revenue has for several months been conducting indoor tests of small unmanned aircraft systems – the term regulators use for drones - and is now seeking for the first time to test the machines outdoors. It plans to use drones manufactured by China's SZ DJI Technology Co Ltd.  In addition to having drones take inventory of trailers outside its warehouses and perform other tasks aimed at making its distribution system more efficient, Wal-Mart is asking the Federal Aviation Administration for permission to research drone use in ""deliveries to customers at Walmart facilities, as well as to consumer homes,"" according to a copy of the application reviewed by Reuters. The move comes as Amazon.com Inc, Google and other companies test drones in the expectation that the FAA will soon establish rules for their widespread commercial use. FAA Deputy Administrator Michael Whitaker said in June that the agency expected to finalize regulations within the next 12 months, faster than previously planned. Commercial drone use is currently illegal, though companies can apply for exemptions.The FAA will review Wal-Mart's petition to determine whether it is similar enough to earlier successful applications to be fast-tracked, or whether it would set a precedent for exemptions, requiring regulators to conduct a detailed risk analysis and seek public comment, agency spokesman Les Dorr said. The FAA normally aims to respond to such petitions in 120 days.Amazon has said it would be ready to begin delivering packages to customers via drones as soon as federal rules allow.   Wal-Mart spokesman Dan Toporek said the company would move quickly to deploy drones depending on its tests and regulations.  ""Drones have a lot of potential to further connect our vast network of stores, distribution centers, fulfillment centers and transportation fleet,"" he said. ""There is a Walmart within five miles of 70 percent of the U.S. population, which creates some unique and interesting possibilities for serving customers with drones.""   Finding ways to more efficiently warehouse, transport and deliver goods to customers has taken on new importance for Wal-Mart, which this month projected a surprise decline in earnings next year as it copes with costs to increase wages, beat back price competition and boost online sales.   In the FAA application, Wal-Mart said it wanted to test drones for taking stock of trailers and other items in the parking lot of a warehouse using electronic tagging and other methods. A Wal-Mart distribution center could have hundreds of trailers waiting in its yard, and a drone could potentially be used to quickly account for what each one is holding. The retailer also wants to test drones for its grocery pickup service, which it has recently expanded to 23 markets with plans to add another 20 markets next year. The test flights would confirm whether a drone could deliver a package to a pick-up point in the parking lot of a store, the application says.     Wal-Mart also said it wants to test home delivery in small residential neighborhoods after obtaining permission from those living in the flight path. The test would see if a drone could be deployed from a truck ""to safely deliver a package at a home and then return safely to the same,"" the application says.To date the FAA has approved more than 2,100 exemptions allowing for commercial drone testing and use.

661,"  LONDON Nov 10 Supermarket Asda, the British arm of Wal-Mart, said it will not participate in this year's Black Friday shopping frenzy, a year after brawls at one of its stores characterised the arrival of the U.S. import to Britain.For the first time last year, most British retailers fully embraced ""Black Friday"" promotions, but many underestimated the demand and police were called to control crowds outside some shops, including Asda.British retailers had hoped the shopping day, named after the day of the year when U.S. retailers traditionally become profitable, would also kick start the Christmas shopping period, however many found it in fact disrupted their cycle.As a result many store groups found themselves selling stock at a discount after finding there was less demand for full-price goods in the following weeks, hitting their profit margins. Asda said it had taken its decision after listening to customers. Instead of investing in a one-off day of sales, it will invest over 26 million pounds ($39 million)in sustained discounts spread across the traditional seasonal shop. ""The decision to step away from Black Friday is not about the event itself,"" Chief Executive Andy Clarke said in a statement.""This year customers have told us loud and clear that they don't want to be held hostage to a day or two of sales."" The day after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, which falls on the fourth Thursday of November, is extravagantly promoted in the United States as the start of the Christmas shopping season.With no national holiday in late November, people in Britain had no reason to notice the day until American online retailer Amazon brought its Black Friday sales across the Atlantic in 2010.

662,"  * Cash offer of $3.60/share a 65 pct premium* Deal has equity value of $177.8 mln* Kroger to get 151 retail stores and 101 pharmacies* Kroger shares little changed   (Adds analyst comment, details, background; updates shares)Nov 11 Supermarket operator Kroger Co  said it would buy smaller chain Roundy's Inc for $800 million including debt to expand in Wisconsin and the Chicago area.The $3.60 per share cash offer represents a 65 percent premium to Roundy's Tuesday close of $2.18.The deal has an equity value of $177.8 million, based on Roundy's outstanding shares as of Aug. 3. Milwaukee-based Roundy's operates supermarkets under the Pick 'n Save, Copps and Metro Market and Mariano's banners, primarily in the upper Midwest.Roundy's shares rose to $3.58 in early trading on Wednesday. Kroger's shares were up slightly at $37.34.The deal will give Kroger 151 retail grocery stores and 101 pharmacies, for a total of 2,774 stores in 35 states.The grocer will also gain presence in new markets such as Milwaukee, Madison and Northern Wisconsin and expand in the Chicago area, where it operates Ralphs and Food 4 Less stores. Telsey Advisory Group analyst Joseph Feldman said that at 6.8-7 times EBITDA it did not appear Kroger was overpaying.Kroger is facing increasing competition not only from traditional grocers such as Supervalu Inc and Albertsons but is also losing sales to mass market chains such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Target Corp, which are expanding their grocery and fresh foods businesses.The company bought grocer Harris Teeter in 2013 to expand in the mid-Atlantic region, and last year it acquired health products retailer Vitacost.com Inc to expand in the fast-growing  health and wellness niche.

663,"   By Kylie Gumpert  A Wal-Mart Stores Inc worker group that has pushed the retailer to raise pay and benefits is launching a 15-day protest leading up to Black Friday to rekindle the fight for a $15 per hour minimum wage and more opportunities to work full time.The retailer has been a major target of the national movement to increase wages, and its decision earlier this year to raise wages to $9 an hour has rippled through the retail industry. Walmart has said the wage increase was not a response to the protests but an effort to improve conditions.The new protest will test the organizing abilities of workers since OUR Walmart, the Organization United for Respect at Walmart, split in two in September. The group organizing the protests ahead of Black Friday, traditionally the biggest shopping day in the United States, is led by a former United Food and Commercial Workers International Union employee but no longer has the union's financial backing. Roughly 1,000 people across all 50 states will participate, and more than 100 workers will fast and organize outside stores, offices and executive homes, according to the group, which has led nation-wide protests on Black Friday in previous years. Tyfani Faulkner, an OUR Walmart member and former Walmart customer service manager in Sacramento, California, said she will fast for all 15 days and that some participants will do a liquid fast or might not fast all days. The company, which has spent $1 billion this year on the wage increase to $9 an hour, will raise that number to $10 for current employees by February next year. Department store managers, which currently make $13 an hour, will receive a  increase to $15 next year.“False attacks and media stunts from the unions have become an annual tradition this time of year,"" the company said in a statement, adding that it will continue to invest $2.7 billion in wages going into next year.

671,"   By Nathan Layne  Wal-Mart Stores Inc reported slightly stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings on Tuesday as it booked its fifth straight gain in U.S. same-store sales, sending its shares up more than 4 percent.However, the company also said it expected sales at stores open at least a year to grow more slowly during the current quarter, which includes the crucial holiday shopping season, and that business would remain competitive. Wal-Mart's earnings have been under pressure from costs to boost entry-level wages and spruce up stores. Last month it warned that those costs would lead earnings to decline by as much as 12 percent next year, prompting many investors to dump the stock.The company has also said that those investments, while hitting profits, are also starting to translate into better customer service and helping to lift sales.""We are starting to get some good momentum,"" Greg Foran, chief executive of U.S. operations, said on a call with reporters. Net profit attributable to the world's largest retailer fell to $3.304 billion, or $1.03 per share, in the third quarter ended on Oct. 31 from $3.711 billion, or $1.15 per share, a year earlier.  Analysts on average had expected 98 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The results included a boost of 4 cents a share from an adjustment of accounting for leases.Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 1.5 percent, while customer traffic increased 1.7 percent. The company said food, apparel and home goods performed well, while its entertainment department struggled due in part to a lack of blockbuster products on the market to drive demand. Wal-Mart said inventory on a comparable store basis fell by 1.9 percent, a sharp contrast with Macy's and other retailers that warned of a build-up of stock in recent weeks.In a note to clients, Cowen & Co analyst Oliver Chen wrote that Wal-Mart's ""clean inventory position"" should somewhat limit promotional pressure among discounters during the holiday season. He also said Wal-Mart's sales growth, driven by sales and apparel, should generally bode well for Target Corp, which reports quarterly results on Wednesday.Wal-Mart said operating income fell 8.8 percent to $5.7 billion. Foran said the company had added more labor hours than initially planned during the quarter while also making investments in customer-facing parts of the store. Wal-Mart said consolidated revenue fell 1.3 percent to $117.4 billion, weighed down by international operations, which have been hurt by a stronger dollar. It said online sales increased 10 percent in the quarter, slower than its plans for growth in the mid-to-high-teens this fiscal year. It cited weakness in Brazil, China and the U.K.The company forecast same-store U.S. sales growth would slow to 1 percent in the fourth quarter due to a tough comparison from last year when a big drop in fuel prices and food inflation boosted sales.Wal-Mart narrowed its forecast for earnings per share in the full fiscal year to end-January to $4.50 to $4.65 from $4.40 to $4.70. The market consensus was for $4.50. Shares of Wal-Mart were up 4.4 percent at $60.43 in morning trade.

676,"  (New throughout, adds executive and analyst comments, updates share price)By Nathan LayneNov 17 Wal-Mart Stores Inc reported slightly stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings on Tuesday as it booked its fifth straight gain in U.S. same-store sales, sending its shares up more than 4 percent.However, the company also said it expected sales at stores open at least a year to grow more slowly during the current quarter, which includes the crucial holiday shopping season, and that business would remain competitive.Wal-Mart's earnings have been under pressure from costs to boost entry-level wages and spruce up stores. Last month it warned that those costs would lead earnings to decline by as much as 12 percent next year, prompting many investors to dump the stock.The company has also said that those investments, while hitting profits, are also starting to translate into better customer service and helping to lift sales.""We are starting to get some good momentum,"" Greg Foran, chief executive of U.S. operations, said on a call with reporters. Net profit attributable to the world's largest retailer fell to $3.304 billion, or $1.03 per share, in the third quarter ended on Oct. 31 from $3.711 billion, or $1.15 per share, a year earlier.Analysts on average had expected 98 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The results included a boost of 4 cents a share from an adjustment of accounting for leases. Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 1.5 percent, while customer traffic increased 1.7 percent. The company said food, apparel and home goods performed well, while its entertainment department struggled due in part to a lack of blockbuster products on the market to drive demand.Wal-Mart said inventory on a comparable store basis fell by 1.9 percent, a sharp contrast with Macy's and other retailers that warned of a build-up of stock in recent weeks.In a note to clients, Cowen & Co analyst Oliver Chen wrote that Wal-Mart's ""clean inventory position"" should somewhat limit promotional pressure among discounters during the holiday season. He also said Wal-Mart's sales growth, driven by sales and apparel, should generally bode well for Target Corp, which reports quarterly results on Wednesday. Wal-Mart said operating income fell 8.8 percent to $5.7 billion. Foran said the company had added more labor hours than initially planned during the quarter while also making investments in customer-facing parts of the store.Wal-Mart said consolidated revenue fell 1.3 percent to $117.4 billion, weighed down by international operations, which have been hurt by a stronger dollar. It said online sales increased 10 percent in the quarter, slower than its plans for growth in the mid-to-high-teens this fiscal year. It cited weakness in Brazil, China and the U.K.The company forecast same-store U.S. sales growth would slow to 1 percent in the fourth quarter due to a tough comparison from last year when a big drop in fuel prices and food inflation boosted sales.Wal-Mart narrowed its forecast for earnings per share in the full fiscal year to end-January to $4.50 to $4.65 from $4.40 to $4.70. The market consensus was for $4.50.Shares of Wal-Mart were up 4.4 percent at $60.43 in morning trade.(Reporting by Nathan Layne; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and David Gregorio)",2015-11-17,WMT,"Tue Nov 17, 2015 | 11:30am EST",UPDATE 3-Wal-Mart earnings beat expectations; shares up,http://www.reuters.com//article/wal-mart-results-idUSL1N13C0NW20151117?type=companyNews

680,"   By Nathan Layne | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Wal-Mart has been dogged by criticism of the standard of its stores in recent years, including long checkout lines and insufficient stocking of its shelves. A Reuters analysis of the giant discount retailer’s growth and its employee numbers may help explain why.   Over the past decade, Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) opened nearly 1,500 new stores in the United States, a 45 percent increase in space and equivalent to more than 4,000 American football fields, while its sales have grown by 50 percent. But based on rough headcount figures provided by the company, the expansion was in stark contrast to the growth in its U.S. workforce, which was only about 8 percent in that time. It means the store space per employee increased around 34 percent.The disparity may help to explain why Wal-Mart acknowledged earlier this year that its customer service needed to be improved significantly as it was hurting sales growth, and why it is now investing a lot more in its workforce and technology to improve the standard of the stores and how shoppers are treated there.    Before the company began rectifying its problems, only 17 percent of stores got a pass mark in an internal survey in February. Customers were asked to judge the stores on their ability to provide clean, fast and friendly service.Through July of last year, the company, which currently operates 5,283 stores under the Walmart and Sam's Club brands in the U.S., endured a six-quarter span in which same-store sales showed flat or negative growth. Greg Foran, who became chief executive of the retailer's U.S. operations in August last year, says employee levels have at times been too low. ""The reality is over the last probably four years it hasn't been enough,"" he said in an interview. Foran also said the company had been too focused on producing profits to benefit shareholders in the near term and this had come at the expense of customers. Wal-Mart, which for many years built a reputation for providing the lowest prices, allowed that advantage to erode. ""The customer lost because the price gap narrowed,"" Foran said. ""And the shareholder won short-term.""    \The Reuters analysis, based on data from the retailer's annual securities filings, shows that by January this year the store space per employee had increased to about 547 square feet from 407 square feet in 2005. The total number of U.S. employees increased to nearly 1.4 million in 2015 from around 1.3 million in 2005, according to the retailer’s figures.INCREASED AUTOMATION To be sure, the available data limits what can be gleaned about Wal-Mart’s use of its workforce. In its filings, Wal-Mart only gives an approximate figure for its headcount and does not disclose the number of hours worked, which would give a more accurate picture of labor productivity. It is also unclear how many of its employees work outside the stores and how much labor may have been shifted to its stores because of increased automation in its warehouses. Wal-Mart spokesman Kory Lundberg said after being provided with the Reuters analysis that the drop in employees per square foot over the past 10 years reflected advances in technology and process, such as increased use of shelf-ready packaging, motorized carts to retrieve shopping carts, and self-checkout lanes.  This year the company installed 8,000 new department managers -- key players in the effort to keep its shelves stocked and improve the customer experience. And in its quarterly financial report on Tuesday, the company said it added more labor hours to its stores than initially planned for its fiscal third quarter.  ""The real question is have you got the right labor in the right area at the right time doing the right jobs,"" Foran said.   Wal-Mart in February announced it was raising starting wages, initially to $9 an hour and then to $10 for existing employees in early 2016, in a bid to improve customer service. The company does not disclose what the average starting wage was before.Last month, it shocked investors by warning earnings would drop by as much as 12 percent in the year to January 2017 because of the increased labor costs, investments in e-commerce and discounts, sending its shares to their lowest level in four years.     On Tuesday Wal-Mart said sales at stores open more than a year rose by 1.5 percent in the fiscal third quarter, the fifth straight quarterly gain. But with operating income still declining as costs rise, Wal-Mart is seeking faster revenue growth. ""We've got to be growing faster,"" Foran said.Wal-Mart added sales performance as a metric in setting cash bonuses for top executives for the year ended January 2015. Previously, bonuses had been largely based on profit targets.DRONE TESTS Wal-Mart says its efforts are having a positive impact. Some 70 percent of its stores have now earned a passing grade on customer service — about quadruple the result in February. A recent survey of Wal-Mart shoppers by securities firm Cowen & Co showed customer service satisfaction at 60 percent in September, its highest in nearly two years. Still, some analysts and suppliers have expressed concern the retailer still does not have enough workers to address a long-standing restocking problem. Based on a rolling survey of major U.S. markets, retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group estimates Wal-Mart currently has anywhere from 10 to 20 percent of products out of stock, up from 2 to 3 percent a decade ago.   ""Wal-Mart simply does not have enough U.S. retail store workers to prevent out-of-stocks and to try to optimize sales,” SRG Managing Director Burt Flickinger said.   Wal-Mart says in-stock levels are improving, though it has not provided detailed figures. On Tuesday, Foran told reporters efforts to ensure it had stock of key items had improved sales of fresh food.     Foran said Wal-Mart would likely cut back on labor over the next decade as it consolidates back office functions and simplifies the stocking process. It is testing a service that will allow customers to use handheld scanners to tally items as they put them in the cart, potentially speeding up checkout, and it has applied for permission to test drones for use in its warehouses and for curbside and home delivery.   Central to the effort to employ labor more effectively is a new inventory management system rolled out this year. Key changes include the introduction of three distinct shifts that ensure important tasks are finished within a 24-hour cycle, instead of spilling over into the next day as in the past. It has cut the number of steps to get product out of the backroom by 60 percent, is using a new smartphone-like device to reduce time needed to scan shelves by 89 percent, and has also begun stacking inventory on the sales floor and on a newly installed top shelf.    ""If we can shave seconds off each of those processes it's worth a lot,"" said Mark Ibbotson, head of the retailer’s Central Operations unit.

682,"  Nov 23 Wal-Mart Stores Inc has decided that Cyber Monday, the biggest online shopping day of the year, should not start on a Monday anymore.The world's largest retailer by revenue will, for the first time this year, launch all its Cyber Monday deals on the Sunday after Thanksgiving rather than the early hours of Monday morning as in previous years.Cyber Monday's origins trace back more than a decade when people started using the high-speed Internet access at their workplaces to purchase things they saw but did not buy during trips to the shopping mall over the weekend after U.S. Thanksgiving, which falls on the fourth Thursday in November.Now, with Internet access readily available, the logic of limiting the event to a weekday no longer holds, said Fernando Madeira, chief executive of Walmart.com. ""The customers have changed but Cyber Monday hasn't changed with them,"" Madeira told Reuters. ""Now everyone has Internet."" Wal-Mart had a handful of 'teaser' deals on Sunday last year but this is the first time it will offer all of its Cyber Monday promotions the day before. It will launch 2,000 online-only specials at 8 p.m. Eastern U.S. time on Sunday, Nov. 29 (0100 GMT on Monday, Nov. 30), up from 500 such deals last year.The move shows how retailers are looking to stretch what were once single-day shopping events in a bid to capture demand. A number of retailers are promoting deals for 'Black Friday' - the day after Thanksgiving and traditionally one of the busiest shopping days - weeks in advance. The early Cyber Monday start also comes as retailers wage a bruising battle for online demand with Amazon.com Inc, which is several times larger than Wal-Mart in e-commerce sales and is growing at a faster rate.Industry-wide Cyber Monday sales in the U.S. will likely reach $3 billion for the first time in 2015, up 12 percent from last year, according to projections by Adobe. While Cyber Monday is expected to remain the biggest single day in terms of online revenue, Black Friday is expected to close the gap, with sales expected to rise 15 percent to $2.7 billion, Adobe said.

683,"  (Adds Wal-Mart comment, details)Nov 24 A U.S. investigation into potential foreign bribery by Wal-Mart Stores Inc has unearthed evidence of possible misconduct by the company in Brazil, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing documents and people familiar with the matter.Federal authorities are investigating $500,000 in payments they believe ultimately went to an individual hired to obtain government permits for building two stores in Brasília, Brazil's capital, between 2009 and 2012, the newspaper said, citing an investigative document. (on.wsj.com/1lIf8kK).The focus on payments in Brazil marks a new development in a years-long investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice into potential misconduct by Wal-Mart in some overseas markets. In addition to Brazil, the department has been investigating potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by the retailer in China, India and Mexico. Wal-Mart spokesman Greg Hitt said in an emailed statement that the company was cooperating with the government on the matter. ""For Walmart, compliance with the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other anti-corruption laws is a key priority,"" Hitt said.The Justice Department declined to comment Lawyers from the U.S. Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Internal Revenue Service, went to Brazil earlier this month to interview witnesses in coordination with local prosecutors, the Wall Street Journal said.Prosecutors are also examining whether senior employees at Wal-Mart in Brazil at the time knew of and approved of the suspected payments. The investigation is at an early stage and it is not clear if charges will be brought, the paper said. The report comes a month after the Wall Street Journal reported that a federal probe into allegations of corruption at Wal-Mart's Mexico operations found few major offenses and was likely to result in a much smaller case than initially expected. That probe was sparked after the New York Times reported in 2012 that Wal-Mart de Mexico (Walmex) had engaged in a multi-year campaign of bribery to build its business there.The recent developments also come after Chief Executive Doug McMillon told investors last month that he planned to review the company's global assets, a comment that sparked speculation he may look to pull out of one or more of the 27 countries in which it operates outside the United States. The retailer's international operations have struggled recently, in part due to a stronger dollar, as well as tough economic conditions in some markets like Brazil, where inflation and high unemployment have hurt sales.Federal prosecutors have evidence of Wal-Mart employees discussing the hiring of a person believed to have previously held a government position in order to obtain the permits, the Wall Street Journal said, citing a written request for assistance sent by Justice Department officials to their counterparts in Brazil. Prosecutors also have evidence Wal-Mart made the payments indirectly through contractors, although it is not clear they have proof it was a bribe, the newspaper said.

686,"  * British retailers embrace U.S. Black Friday discounts* More shoppers head online after brawls in stores last year* Sales boost jeopardises margins in crucial period   (Adds Argos comment)By James Davey and Li-mei HoangLONDON, Nov 27 Britons splashed out on ""Black Friday"" bargains on Friday but many opted to go online rather than head to the shops for an event imported from the United States that has become a key feature of the UK retail calendar.With many shoppers having received their last pay packet before Christmas, retailers are hoping the promotions will kick-start festive trading after a weak November.Researcher Conlumino is forecasting the event will generate UK sales, both in stores and online, of 1.6 billion pounds ($2.4 billion), up 20 percent on 2014. It forecast online spending would jump 32 percent to 1.1 billion pounds.""There's been plenty of anecdotal evidence around...to suggest that Black Friday, in terms of store-based retail, has been something of a damp squib in the UK this year,"" said Bryan Roberts of researcher Kantar Retail.""It seems certain that Black Friday will largely be an online event this year.""Last year's Black Friday was marred by long queues and brawls in stores. A typical mixture of strong winds and heavy rain across Britain and memories of last year's scuffles were likely to have encouraged more Britons to shop online this year. British retailers are anxious to avoid a repeat of last year's trading pattern when the surge in lower-margin sales was followed by disappointing demand as shoppers held back in the hope of further discounts.This year several retailers -- including Amazon, Argos, Marks & Spencer and Dixons Carphone  -- have stretched ""Black Friday"" discounts over several days to smooth demand.Social media indicated stores across the country were quieter than last year and shoppers better behaved.Researcher FootFall estimates Black Friday in-store shopper numbers will be down by up to 4 percent from 2014.Supermarket Asda, which is owned by Wal-Mart and was one of the UK's Black Friday pioneers, stepped back from the event this year, blaming ""shopper fatigue"". UNPRECEDENTED DEMAND ONLINE At the huge Westfield shopping centre in east London, close to the London 2012 Olympic stadium, trading was lively rather than frenzied.Shaquille Simon, a 21 year-old McDonald's manager, said he bought two TVs online from Tesco at midnight: ""I bought one for me and one for my mum. Why not?""He then headed to Westfield, where he picked up speakers and headphones. ""If I see something I like I'll buy it. Simple as that,"" he said. In the U.S. Black Friday, the day after the Thanksgiving holiday, was so named because spending would pick up and retailers would begin to turn a profit for the year and move into the black.Introduced into Britain in 2010 by U.S. online retailer Amazon, its popularity forced store groups to join the fray and this year, according to a survey by Barclays, 77 percent of them are participating.There was a similar trend in the United States where crowds were relatively thin but online sales appeared strong.Dixons Retail's Currys PC World chain reported unprecedented online demand, with a 53 percent increase in hourly web traffic compared to last year. The firm's CEO Seb James tweeted: ""Website holding up really well after big investment this year.""Social media reported that both Argos and Tesco's websites were struggling to keep up with demand.Argos said its site had so far seen over 7.2 million visits but had not crashed or seen any outages. It apologised if some customers were experiencing delays as a result of demand.Previous Black Friday winners in Britain have been those retailers, such as Dixons Retail, who buy specifically for the event, enabling them to maintain profit margins.Losers tend to be those who simply slash prices on existing stock or react to rivals' promotions.

697,"  * Deal valued at $15.4 bln on fully diluted basis* Combination to help negotiations with big retailers* Newell Brands to have total sales of about $16 bln* Jarden shares trade well below $60/share offer   (Adds details, analysts comment; updates shares)By Yashaswini SwamynathanDec 14 Newell Rubbermaid Inc, known for its food containers, agreed to buy Sunbeam and Coleman products maker Jarden Corp for more than $15 billion in a deal that will give it more leverage with retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc.The deal announced on Monday comes amid growing pressure for retailers to hold down prices as they compete with online players such as Amazon.com Inc.Reuters reported in October that Wal-Mart, which provides nearly 13 percent of Newell Rubbermaid's revenue, was asking suppliers to cut prices.The deal, while primarily aimed at accelerating growth, will make it easier for Newell to fend off demands for price cuts, Neil Saunders, chief executive of research firm Conlumino, told Reuters.Based on 220.35 million Jarden shares outstanding as of Oct. 30, the deal has a value of $13.22 billion. However, Newell Rubbermaid said that on a fully diluted basis the offer was valued at $15.4 billion.The combined company, to be called Newell Brands, will have annual sales of $16 billion.Newell Brands' revenue from Wal-Mart is expected to be more than 2.6 times Newell Rubbermaid's 2014 revenue from the retailer, the Newell Rubbermaid said in an investor presentation, while revenue from Target Corp stores is expected to be 1.9 times bigger.From Amazon, revenue is expected to grow by 1.8 times after the deal closes in the second quarter of 2016. The deal - which gives Newell Rubbermaid ownership of more than 120 Jarden brands, including Yankee Candle, Crock-Pot cookware and class rings maker Jostens Inc - will also significantly increase its U.S. distribution network.PREMIUM DISAPPPOINTS Newell Brands will be led by Newell Rubbermaid Chief Executive Michael Polk. Martin Franklin, Jarden's founder and executive chairman, will be on the board.Jarden shareholders will receive $21 in cash and 0.862 Newell shares for each share held, implying a $60 per share offer. The offer is at a 24 percent premium to Jarden's closing stock price on Dec. 4, the day before reports emerged that the company was in talks to combine with Newell. Jarden's shares were up 1 percent at $53.30 in early afternoon trading, far below the offer price, while Newell's stock was down 10.5 percent at $40.51.Analysts attributed the gap between the offer price and  Jarden's shares to disappointment in the premium and the exclusion of Franklin from an executive role in the new company.Newell Rubbermaid shareholders will own about 55 percent of Newell Brands.The companies said they expected to realize cost savings of $500 million in the four years after the transaction closes.Goldman Sachs was lead financial adviser to Newell Rubbermaid, while Centerview Partners advised the board.Barclays was the lead financial adviser to Jarden, with UBS Investment Bank also advising.Jones Day and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett provided legal counsel to Newell Rubbermaid, while Greenberg Traurig LLP and Kane Kessler PC were legal advisers to Jarden.(Reporting by Yashaswini Swamynathan; Additional reporting by Sruthi Ramakrishnan in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila and Ted Kerr)",2015-12-14,WMT,"Mon Dec 14, 2015 | 1:37pm EST",UPDATE 3-Newell Rubbermaid to buy Jarden to create consumer durables giant,http://www.reuters.com//article/jarden-ma-newellrubbermaid-idUSL3N1433OC20151214?type=companyNews
698,"  BANGKOK Dec 14 The world's largest canned tuna maker Thai Union Group PCL said on Monday any migrant labour abuse in the seafood industry was unacceptable.The statement came after the Associated Press reported that shrimp processed in plants using forced and child labour in Thailand was on the shelves in U.S. stores.One of those plants allegedly supplied a subsidiary of Thai Union, AP reported.Greenpeace called on the company and the Thai seafood sector to do more on the issue.The news comes as Thailand faces pressure from the European Union to clean up in another problem area in the industry - illegal fishing - or face a trade ban.""Any illegal or unethical labour practices are unacceptable to Thai Union,"" the company's Chief Executive Thiraphong Chansiri said in the statement. ""This is yet another wake up call not only to us, but to the entire industry."" Thai Union's subsidiary Okeanus had terminated its relationship with a supplier it suspected of breaking its code of conduct, the company said in the statement.Thai Union, which counts Wal-Mart and Costco Wholesale Corp among buyers, said last week it had decided to stop working with external shrimp processing plants. It would bring those operations in-house from Jan. 1, because it was difficult to guarantee external suppliers were following its rules, Thai Union said. The company would offer jobs to a thousand of the workers from those external processing plants.Greenpeace called on the Thai Union to do more.""The inaction by the entire industry and shiny PR moves are no longer acceptable,"" Greenpeace U.S. Oceans Campaign Director John Hocevar said. ""It is time for Thai Union and its buyers to audit and clean up every single link in their seafood supply chains -- not just the one implicated in the latest of many investigations.""Shares in Thai Union closed down 1.68 percent to 17.60 baht on Monday, underperforming a 1.04 percent drop of the main index .Thailand, the world's third-largest seafood exporter, was given six months by the European Union in April to address issues that had allowed fish caught illegally to enter the supply chain.The U.S. State Department said in a report this year on human trafficking that some Thai and migrant workers were subjected to forced labour on Thai fishing boats.

703,"   By Frank McGurty | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A lawyer for the Wal-Mart truck driver involved in a 2014 crash that severely injured comedian Tracy Morgan and killed his friend said on Friday he would ask a New Jersey judge next week to dismiss all criminal charges against his client.Kevin Roper's rights were violated, his attorney David Glassman said, because a federal court refused to allow him to ask for a stay in a civil suit that the ""Saturday Night Live"" entertainer brought against Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Such stays are routinely granted while related criminal matters are pending, Glassman said.If the court had allowed Roper to intervene, ""a tsunami of negative pre-trial publicity would have been avoided and Roper's right to a fair trial would have been preserved,"" Glassman said in an email to Reuters.Roper's hearing is scheduled for Tuesday in Middlesex County Superior Court in New Brunswick. The June 2014 accident on the New Jersey Turnpike left Morgan, now 47, with a serious head injury and broken bones and put him in a coma.His friend and fellow comedian James ""Jimmy Mack"" McNair was killed when the tractor-trailer truck driven by Roper plowed into the rear end of a limousine bus in which Morgan and six others were riding. Nine others were also injured in the chain-reaction collision.The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board issued a report in August that found Roper responsible. It said the truck driver had not slept for 28 hours when the early-morning accident occurred, a finding that Glassman denies. Roper, a Georgia resident who was 35 when the accident occurred, faces charges of vehicular homicide and assault by auto, though Glassman said indictments have yet to be handed down.Glassman said the Middlesex County prosecutor's office rebuffed him when he asked it to intervene with the federal court to request the stay. ""A prosecutor can't stand by while this occurs, and then seek to cash in by way of a speedy plea or conviction after a year of negative publicity,"" Glassman said.The Middlesex County prosecutor could not be reached immediately for comment.In September, Wal-Mart Stores Inc settled a suit brought by Morgan and two others for undisclosed terms.

707,"   By Nandita Bose and Kylie Gumpert | CHICAGO/NEW YORK  CHICAGO/NEW YORK Dec 24 Retailers are struggling to meet even modest forecasts for the holiday shopping season this year after the ""Super Saturday"" before Christmas failed to live up to its nickname, industry research groups said.The last Saturday before Christmas often sets the annual record for retail sales, vying with Thanksgiving weekend's Black Friday. In recent years, last-minute shopping has determined the success of the season, and a relatively weak final weekend bodes poorly for retailers.This year Super Saturday weekend sales in stores and online rose 4 percent to $55 billion, after a 2.5 percent gain last year, according to retail consultancy and private-equity fund Customer Growth Partners. That puts overall store and online sales from the start of November through Dec. 22 on track to rise 3.1 percent, below the 3.2 percent pace the firm forecast and down from 4.1 percent growth in the same period last year.""Sales have been sluggish so far this year as most consumers are still buying close to need,"" said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners. ""What's worse is the marked deceleration from a year ago,"" he said.Last year, last-minute sales gained in the final 10 days of the holiday season, driven by savings from lower gasoline prices. If sales, spurred by gift card redemptions, hold up in the week after Christmas this year, retailers could move closer to meeting performance forecasts, consultants and retail experts said.The National Retail Federation, the leading industry body, has forecast a 3.7 percent rise in store and online sales this year. Discounts across categories have been deeper than last year, in the range of 20 percent to 50 percent, said Traci Gregorski, vice president of marketing at analytics firm Market Track. But consultants said the discounting still had not been enough to boost store traffic materially.Promotions earlier in November took a toll on in-store sales during the Thanksgiving weekend, when total spending was the same as last year, according to the NRF.The drop in store traffic has been offset to a large extent by online sales. Forrester expects U.S. households to spend $95.5 billion online during the holiday season, up 11 percent over last year. E-commerce accounts for 10 percent of U.S. retail spending annually, but 14 percent of spending during November and December, the company said. The surge in online sales did not significantly disrupt services this year at delivery companies like United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp, which put firm cut-off dates for gifts to ship in time for Christmas, the companies and consultants said.Most retailers had little choice but to comply with the cut-off dates.""We have stopped (free shipping) for orders that promised delivery by Christmas"" because of UPS' cut-off date, said Noelle Sadler, chief marketing officer at online clothing retailer Lulus. WEAKER TRAFFIC Analytics firm RetailNext, which tracks specialty stores like Best Buy Co Inc and large retailers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Target Corp, said sales dropped 6.7 percent over the pre-Christmas weekend compared with a year ago, and store traffic dipped 10.4 percent. However, customers who did hit the stores spent more.""The jury is still out,"" said Bridget Johns, head of customer engagement at RetailNext. ""We still have over a week before the season closes but it will surely be a race to the finish line.""Best-sellers during the holiday season have included toys and home improvement items like appliances, tools, furnishings and home decor.But apparel sales plummeted as warm weather hurt sales of winter clothing and discounts on electronics hurt retail margins, even as sales volumes in the category remained robust.

Brazilian newspaper Valor Economico in December reported that 30 stores would be shut.The people familiar with Wal-Mart's Brazil operations told Reuters that Wal-Mart had shuttered roughly 60 stores in the past few weeks.

Wal-Mart declined to comment on Thursday about the store closures but announced that Flavio Cotini, currently the chief financial officer of the Brazilian operations, would become the CEO, replacing Guilherme Loureiro, who was named the head of the Mexican business. Cotini is the fourth CEO of Brazil since 2008.    The shake-up comes three months after Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon flagged to investors that he was planning to review the retailer's global operations and ""close the stores that should be closed.""His comments had sparked speculation that Wal-Mart would look to restructure or even pull out of markets where it has struggled.

716,"  (Adds details on Wal-Mart Brazil store closures)MEXICO CITY Jan 14 Mexico's Walmex, the country's biggest retailer, on Thursday named Guilherme Loureiro its new chief executive officer from Feb. 1.Loureiro was previously CEO of Wal-Mart in Brazil, where the retailer has recently shuttered more than 10 percent of its stores as part of a restructuring effort. He will take over from Enrique Ostale as CEO for Mexico and Central America, while Ostale will continue in his role as chief executive of Wal-Mart Latin America, the company said in a statement.Ostale was CEO of Walmex for just over a year, after previous CEO Scot Rank stepped down in December 2014. Rank, who now leads dairy company Grupo Lala, led Walmex at the time of a 2012 New York Times report that alleged the retailer bribed local officials to open stores faster. He stayed for around two years after it was published. A federal probe into the allegations has found few major offenses, and is likely to result in a much smaller case than investigators expected, the Wall Street Journal reported in October, citing people familiar with the situation.Walmex, which operates in Mexico and Central America, ended the year with 3,066 stores, compared to 558 in Brazil. Doug McMillion, chief executive of the U.S.-based parent company Wal-Mart Stores Inc, told investors last year that he would review the retailer's global operations and ""close the stores that should be closed.""Walmex shares closed up 1.78 percent at 44.00 pesos on Thursday.

717,"   By Lehar Maan and Derek Francis | BENGALURU  BENGALURU Infosys Ltd(INFY.NS) cheered investors with a forecast-beating quarterly profit and a stronger sales growth outlook, as India's second-largest software services exporter regains market share from rivals by sharpening its focus on high-margin services.The company's strong earnings in the past few quarters has narrowed its gap with industry leader Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS.NS), which has been struggling with sluggish growth in select markets and industrial sectors.Infosys, a bellwether for India's roughly $150 billion IT services industry, had lost ground to its rivals including TCS and Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp (CTSH.O) in the recent past, as it struggled to innovate and retain staff.Under Chief Executive Vishal Sikka, brought in about one-and-a-half years ago to chart a new strategy, Infosys has been focusing on winning more lucrative digital technology and automation outsourcing contracts.The new focus comes at a time when western clients are not looking to raise their annual IT spending budget, but the share of new technology services is expected to surge. ""Based on what we see right now, we are optimistic about our prospects in the near term. So we are raising our guidance for this financial year,"" Sikka told reporters.Infosys, which counts Apple (AAPL.O), Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and Wal-mart Stores (WMT.N) among its clients, raised its sales growth view for the year through March 31 to 12.8-13.2 percent from the 10-12 percent guided in October. The company also reported a 6.6 percent increase in quarterly profit to 34.65 billion rupees ($516.5 million) as it added 75 new clients and renewed some existing large contracts.Analysts on average had expected a net profit of 33.53 billion rupees, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue in the quarter rose 15.3 percent to 159.02 billion rupees.Infosys (INFY.N) has an outsourcing deal pipeline of roughly  $3 billion, its Chief Operating Officer Pravin Rao said.    VISA WOES Indian IT firms including Infosys and Wipro (WIPR.NS) send thousands of staff to work at client locations overseas, and a measure passed last month by the U.S. Congress doubling the cost of sponsoring workers is a concern for the sector.Indian IT industry lobby group the National Association of Software and Service Companies (Nasscom) estimates local IT firms would incur an extra $400 million a year in costs due to the spike in visa fees.  Firms are exploring various options to cushion its impact.""Local hiring, we are working on some advanced ways to do better collaboration across borders. Not just because of visa (fee increase), but we believe that technology is within our reach. We call it visa independent... model,"" Sikka said.Shares in Infosys ended 4.6 percent higher on the day, after having risen as much as 5.3 percent earlier, while the broader Mumbai market index .NSEI fell 0.3 percent.($1 = 67.0900 Indian rupees) (Reporting by Lehar Maan and Derek Francis; Writing by Devidutta Tripathy and Sumeet Chatterjee; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)",2016-01-14,WMT,"Thu Jan 14, 2016 | 6:26am EST",Infosys bridges gap with rivals after lucrative deal wins,http://www.reuters.com//article/infosys-results-idUSKCN0US0C420160114?type=companyNews

721,"   By Nathan Layne  Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) said on Friday that it would pull the plug on its smallest store format, Walmart Express, and close 269 locations as it contends with higher costs in its home market of the United States and disappointing results overseas. The move includes Wal-Mart's largest-ever single culling in the United States, where the company is closing 154 stores. The other 115 stores are in Latin America, including 60 in Brazil.The world's largest retailer said it hoped to transfer many of the 10,000 U.S. and 6,000 Latin American workers in the closed stores to other locations. Wal-Mart's earnings have been under pressure due to last year's decision to raise entry-level wages as well as higher investments aimed at closing the gap online with Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). At the same time, Wal-Mart is struggling overseas, where a strong U.S. dollar reduces the value of local sales.The closings come three months after Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon disclosed plans to review global operations and shut underperforming stores. Friday's announcement marks the first step in that restructuring effort.Wal-Mart said the closures represented less than 1 percent of its global revenue. The biggest cuts are in the United States, including all 102 Walmart Express stores.At 12,000 to 15,000 square feet, Express stores are less than one-tenth the size of a typical Walmart Supercenter. The format had been in pilot since 2011 but did not deliver the desired results. Moody's retail analyst Charlie O'Shea described the closures as a long-overdue ""pruning."" ""I've always wondered why it's taken so long to cull the U.S. store base because they really haven't done much of it over the past several years,"" O'Shea said. Wal-Mart said the move would reduce earnings by 20 cents to 22 cents a diluted share, with nearly all of that to be booked in the fourth quarter ending this month. In November, it forecast a full-year profit of $4.50 to $4.65. The company's shares fell 2.6 percent to $61.39.The other 52 U.S. stores to be closed are a mixture of Supercenters, Wal-Mart's largest format; discount stores; Neighborhood Market groceries; and outlets in the company's Sam's Club bulk-selling wholesale chain.The closings highlight the challenges Wal-Mart faces in finding growth opportunities in both its home market, which it has blanketed with some 4,500 stores, and overseas, where it has grown to more than 6,000 locations but has struggled to generate consistent returns.In an internal memo to staff, McMillon said a regular review of the company's assets was vital for growth. ""Doing this ensures we focus and align our resources in ways that build a strong company positioned to win in the future,"" said the memo, which was seen by Reuters.  The Arkansas-based retailer said it would still open 142 to 165 stores in the United States in the year ending in January 2017. For the first time, it also disclosed plans to open 200 to 240 stores overseas in the coming year.The company said about 95 percent of the closed U.S. stores were within 10 miles of another that it owns, making it possible to move some workers to other locations. It said it would provide 60 days of pay and severance for eligible workers not placed.The cuts drew criticism from a group backed by the United Food & Commercial Workers International Union, which for years has been behind a campaign pushing for better wages and benefits for Wal-Mart employees.""Sadly, these latest store closings could very well be just the beginning,"" Jess Levin, communications director at Making Change at Walmart, said in an emailed statement.

724,"   By Nathan Layne  Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) said Wednesday that more than 1.2 million employees would get a raise in 2016, and the retailer will allow paid days off to be carried over into the next year as it aims to retain workers amid a tight U.S. labor market.The company announced plans for the raise last year as part of a two-step, $2.7 billion investment in wages, benefits and training, although it had not disclosed details of the second phase in which it is bumping its mininum pay to $10 an hour, following an increase to $9 in April. In a statement the company said all employees hired before Jan. 1 would be paid at least $10 an hour, with entry-level hires after that date eligible for that wage after completing a training program.The latest raise would increase the average full-time hourly wage at Wal-Mart to $13.38 from $12.96 and average part-time wage to $10.58 from $10. The federal minimum is $7.25.The world's largest retailer also announced that workers would, for the first time, be able to carry over paid days off, with full-time employees transferring up to 80 hours into following year. The move highlights how Wal-Mart and other employers are responding to a tight labor market with the U.S. unemployment rate at a 7-1/2 year low of 5 percent. Wal-Mart has said its investment in wages is depressing profits; labor costs were a main factor behind an earnings warning in October. But it believes better pay is leading to improved service and boosting U.S. sales. ""We're seeing strong increases in both customer experience and associate engagement scores,"" Judith McKenna, chief operating officer for Wal-Mart's U.S. operations, said in the statement. Still, the moves fall short of the demands of labor groups, which have called on companies to pay a ""living wage"" of $15 an hour. Jessica Levin, a spokeswoman for a the union-backed group Making Change at Walmart, said she was skeptical that employees would see much benefit. She cited reports from workers who saw their hours cut after the initial wage hike last year or who received a smaller annual raise than they might have due to changes in the calculation of yearly performance-based hikes.Levin noted that the announcement came just a few days after Wal-Mart said it was closing 269 stores, including 154 in the United States, eliminating some 16,000 jobs at closed stores globally. Wal-Mart said it would try to transfer many workers to nearby stores. EMPLOYEE RATING OF COMPANY INCHES UP Wal-Mart said it was also raising the minimum rates for hourly pay bands, which differ based on job type, but would leave the maximum rate unchanged following a bump last year. To compensate workers at or above the top pay band rates, it will provide a lump payment equal to 2 percent of annual pay.Scott Dobroski, a career trends analyst at jobs website operator Glassdoor, said the raise and paid time off changes should help Wal-Mart attract employees.He noted that Wal-Mart's employee rating, as measured by input from workers to the Glassdoor site, had improved to 3.1 in the final quarter of 2015 from 2.9 in the last quarter of 2014 before its wage hike. The average for all companies is 3.2 on its 1 to 5 scale.

Jessica Levin, a spokeswoman for a the union-backed group Making Change at Walmart, said she was skeptical that employees would see much benefit. She cited reports from workers who saw their hours cut after the initial wage hike last year or who received a smaller annual raise than they might have due to changes in the calculation of yearly performance-based hikes.Levin noted that the announcement came just a few days after Wal-Mart said it was closing 269 stores, including 154 in the United States, eliminating some 16,000 jobs at closed stores globally. Wal-Mart said it would try to transfer many workers to nearby stores. EMPLOYEE RATING OF COMPANY INCHES UP Wal-Mart said it was also raising the minimum rates for hourly pay bands, which differ based on job type, but would leave the maximum rate unchanged following a bump last year. To compensate workers at or above the top pay band rates, it will provide a lump payment equal to 2 percent of annual pay.Scott Dobroski, a career trends analyst at jobs website operator Glassdoor, said the raise and paid time off changes should help Wal-Mart attract employees.He noted that Wal-Mart's employee rating, as measured by input from workers to the Glassdoor site, had improved to 3.1 in the final quarter of 2015 from 2.9 in the last quarter of 2014 before its wage hike. The average for all companies is 3.2 on its 1 to 5 scale.

Casino is GPA's controlling shareholder. The filing said Wal Mart's former Brazil president Marcos Samaha was named as chief operating officer of the supermarket unit, Multivarejo. GPA CEO Ronaldo Iabrudi would remain in charge until the company found a substitute, probably next year. After that, Iabrudi is expected to become chairman of GPA's board, according to a source familiar with the company's plans.The company declined to comment on future plans for management. Brazilian retailers have struggled to keep supermarket sales up in the middle of the worst recession in decades, as rising unemployment and double-digit inflation hit consumer confidence. Net revenue in GPA's Multivarejo unit slipped 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier.Shares wiped out earlier losses and closed 0.6 percent higher on Wednesday at 35.22 reais.

733,"   By Nick Brown | SAN JUAN  SAN JUAN Feb 1 Wal-Mart's Puerto Rico subsidiary on Monday said a U.S. commonwealth tax on big companies is discriminatory, setting the stage for a trial starting on Tuesday that could threaten a tax increase Puerto Rico hoped would protect local businesses and jump-start its economy.In court papers filed ahead of the trial, in U.S. District Court in San Juan, Wal-Mart said ""it is the only taxpayer"" on the island subject to a tax hike enforced on goods purchased by big companies from corporate affiliates outside of Puerto Rico.""Wal-Mart PR was itself specifically targeted for discrimination,"" the company said, claiming it was taxed at 114 percent of net taxable income.Wal-Mart sued Puerto Rico Treasury Secretary Juan Zaragoza-Gomez in December, alleging the increase, which was signed into law on May 29 last year, violated the commerce clause of the U.S. constitution by unfairly taxing interstate commerce. The law increased the tax for on-island companies with more than $2.75 billion in revenues that buy goods from off-island ""related parties"" to 6.5 percent from 2 percent.Wal-Mart says it is the only company that fits into the new tax's highest bracket, effectively taxed on items from its own distribution centers, but not those bought from Puerto Rican vendors.In separate court papers on Monday, Zaragoza-Gomez said the tax is designed to protect against ""'leakage' of income outside of the Commonwealth's taxing jurisdiction."" He argued that the case does not belong in federal court to begin with, saying tax disputes are meant to be adjudicated at the state level. Puerto Rico is in economic crisis, facing $70 billion in debt, a 45 percent poverty rate and a shrinking population as residents leave for the mainland United States. The island is trying to sway bondholders on steep cuts to repayments, but faces resistance from creditors who feel it has not been transparent about its finances.Those creditors may keep an eye on the Wal-Mart case, in which Judge Jose Fuste has ordered financial disclosures from Puerto Rico. Separately on Monday, a spokesman for Puerto Rico's governor said the island would within days release audited financial statements for fiscal year 2014, which are months behind schedule.Puerto Rico's attempts to stay afloat have lately landed it in court. Earlier this month, bond insurers Ambac Financial  and Assured Guaranty sued the commonwealth for redirecting money reserved for certain debt payments to pay others. Puerto Rico on Friday asked Fuste to dismiss that case.Wal-Mart, which closed seven Puerto Rico stores as part of a larger global culling in January, says it is Puerto Rico's largest private sector employer, with some 14,000 employees.In its complaint in December, Wal-Mart said it cannot sustain its operations in Puerto Rico ""for a lengthy period of time"" under the new tax.

737,"   By Nathan Layne  Wal-Mart Stores said on Wednesday it would start offering fixed shifts and unveiled other details of planned scheduling changes aimed at retaining and motivating its rank-and-file workers.The changes are designed to offer employees greater control over their schedules, addressing an issue that has been a focus of labor activists who say retailers give little notice on shifts and generally exert too much control over worker hours.OUR Walmart, a labor group that has been pressuring the retailer on wages and benefits, described the move on scheduling as a positive step but said it believed Wal-Mart should still pay higher wages and offer more full-time jobs.Wal-Mart had flagged its intention to offer more reliable scheduling last year as part of a $2.7 billion investment in wages and training. Currently store managers allocate hours within the times employees say they are available to work.Wal-Mart said that it would start introducing fixed shifts, under which workers can lock-in the same weekly hours, and flex shifts, which will allow workers to set their own schedules from a set of available time slots. The retailer aims to have the changes, which it has been piloting at 11 stores, in place at its roughly 4,600 locations by the end of 2016. The changes will not necessarily mean more hours for workers, whose options will still be limited based on when staffing is needed to match customer flow.""Fixed schedules will provide associates a consistent schedule that does not change for up to a year,"" said Wal-Mart spokesman Kory Lundberg. ""Flex schedules offer flexibility for associates who want to choose their own schedules from shifts that vary according to customer demand."" The moves reflect broader efforts by Wal-Mart to motivate and retain its workforce of 1.3 million. Initial tests at pilot stores in Arkansas and Kansas showed an 11 percent drop in absenteeism and a 14 percent fall in turnover, Lundberg said.OUR Walmart issued a statement calling the scheduling changes a ""hard-won victory"" but said that workers still need better pay and additional hours to make ends meet.Jess Levin, spokeswoman for the United Food & Commercial Workers International Union, said some workers had complained about having their hours cut after the wage increase last year and urged the company to make sure better scheduling was made widely available.""Walmart workers deserve the fair and flexible scheduling for which they have fought,"" Levin said in an emailed statement.",2016-02-17,WMT,"Wed Feb 17, 2016 | 4:46pm EST",Wal-Mart aims to improve scheduling for U.S. workers,http://www.reuters.com//article/walmart-hours-idUSL2N15W2D2?type=companyNews
738,"   By Brad Haynes and Nathan Layne | CAMPO GRANDE, Brazil/BENTONVILLE, Arkansas  CAMPO GRANDE, Brazil/BENTONVILLE, Arkansas When Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT.N) first expanded into Brazil's midwestern farm-belt city of Campo Grande seven years ago, the economy was booming and executives were eager to open stores even in sub-prime locations on one-way streets heading out of town.    It didn’t last. At the end of December, the U.S. retailer closed both of its Maxxi brand cash-and-carry stores in Campo Grande as part of a restructuring that shuttered 60 locations across Brazil, including some Supercenters. Shoppers said the stores could not compete on assortment, price or location.  ""It was never clear who Maxxi was for. It wasn't cheap enough for the poor. But there was no appeal for the middle class,"" said Ordecy Gossler, 40, a public accountant filling his cart with cleaning supplies and toilet paper at Atacadão, a rival chain run by France's Carrefour (CARR.PA). ""When they announced in December that both Maxxis were closing, no one in my office knew where they were.""   Today, Wal-Mart has just one Supercenter left in this city of 850,000 people, whose demographic of thrifty shoppers had once seemed suited to the world's largest retailer. It shuttered the city’s other one at the end of the year, as traffic dwindled in the shopping mall it was meant to anchor. The retreat from Campo Grande is emblematic of Wal-Mart’s broader issues in Brazil, a once-red-hot destination for foreign retailers and other companies that has turned stone cold. And the lackluster performance in Latin America's largest economy shows how tactics that helped Wal-Mart build success in the U.S. sometimes get badly lost in translation overseas.International results have been anemic, despite $22 billion in capital investment over the past five years. Wal-Mart last year generated a 4.5 percent operating profit margin from international markets, well below the 7.4 percent return posted from the U.S.  Seeking higher returns, Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon in October announced a strategic review of the company’s global assets. Some securities analysts have speculated Wal-Mart could exit Brazil, as well as other markets in Latin America where it is already closing an additional 55 stores.   The pullback in Brazil also has some worrying echoes of previous Wal-Mart debacles overseas, including South Korea and Germany, two markets it abandoned in 2006.LABOR PROBLEMS    Brazil in particular has been dogged by poor locations, inefficient operations, labor troubles and uncompetitive prices -- with some of the problems baked in during an aggressive, decade-long growth surge, according to interviews with a dozen former and current Wal-Mart executives, as well as analysts, shoppers and store employees.   For a graphic showing some of Wal-Mart's Brazil problems, see tmsnrt.rs/1oH9pNuWal-Mart would not comment on financial results from Brazil ahead of the company's quarterly earnings on Feb. 18. People familiar with the numbers told Reuters that Wal-Mart has posted operating losses in Brazil for each of the past seven years.    Jo Newbould, a spokeswoman for the retailer, said the store closures were part of its efforts to “actively manage” its global assets and that it has been working to lower costs in Brazil. David Cheesewright, head of Wal-Mart’s international operations, said in an interview that it has no plans to quit Brazil.  He pointed to the company’s decision to invest in completing an integration of legacy computer systems into the wider Wal-Mart platform as evidence of a commitment to the market. ""That's not the act of someone who is packing up the firm for other purposes,"" he said.  Cheesewright expressed optimism about a turnaround. ""It's a market that has always been high on potential, but has been a roller-coaster ride in terms of its performance,"" he said. ""It happens to be on a downturn at the moment, and I'm sure it will do what it always has done, which is improve.""  RUNAWAY GROWTH   Wal-Mart first entered Brazil in 1995 and grew in measured steps for nearly a decade. That changed in 2004-2005, when it spent about $1 billion to buy two retailers, Bompreço S.A. Supermercados do Nordeste and Sonae Distribuição Brasil S.A.    The deals expanded Wal-Mart’s operations into the northeast and south of Brazil, and marked the beginning of a spending spree aimed at building a national footprint. With the takeovers came an array of brands: Wal-Mart currently operates under nine different store banners in Brazil.  At the height of the expansion, former Wal-Mart executives said, a land rush mentality took hold. Brazil’s thriving economy in those years convinced executives the biggest risk lay in moving too slowly. In response, they approved new store sites based on increasingly rosy forecasts of future sales. ""Most executives didn't have the voice to say, 'Don't open this store; let's not approve more stores,’” a former finance executive recalled. “Why not? Because Brazil was the new country. We needed to put investment in before others do.""      In a six-year stretch through the fiscal year ending January 2013, Wal-Mart doubled its locations, reaching nearly 560 at its peak.   The rapid expansion strained Wal-Mart's logistics --  traditionally one of its strong points in the U.S. but a drag on performance in Brazil.In some cases, delivery trucks drove days to reach distant stores from centrally located warehouses. Executives from headquarters bickered with those running some kinds of stores about who should bear the distribution costs, the former finance executive said.Amid the focus on growth, executives never fully integrated the legacy information systems from Bompreço and Sonae. Disruptions in communication between headquarters and the many different store types allowed inefficiencies to take root. Buyers, for instance, found themselves using three laptops, one each for the two legacy systems and another for the Wal-Mart platform, people familiar with the matter said.TAX ISSUES Cheesewright said he had put a priority on systems and would complete the integration by the middle of 2016. He said that would allow Brazil to benefit fully from system and process advancements made in the U.S., helping it to lower costs.   He also said Wal-Mart was getting a grip on Brazil's complex tax system and litigious labor market, problems that have dogged it for years. In January 2014 Wal-Mart disclosed that unforeseen Brazil tax assessments and employment claims tied to a cost-cutting drive would slice 2 percent off its annual earnings globally. Labor claims in Brazil also hurt its results in the third quarter of the financial year that has just ended.    Cheesewright said it was implementing a plan, including putting advanced time-keeping equipment in stores and getting workers to formally clock in, which should lower the risk of worker lawsuits.""A lot of the stuff in Brazil is just the basic stuff: do people properly clock out for their lunch breaks, do you manage overtime correctly, do they have the right breaks between shifts?"" he said. ""It's a lot of basic blocking and tackling.""Wal-Mart, whose sales at existing stores in the country edged down 0.6 percent in the August-October quarter, isn't the only retailer hurting in Brazil.With the economy in a deepening recession, market leader GPA (PCAR4.SA), controlled by France's Casino (CASP.PA), suffered a 2.3 percent sales drop at existing stores in the October-December quarter and has said it would slash investments in 2016.    Carrefour bucked the trend, posting 8.5 percent growth in sales at existing stores, thanks to investments in hypermarkets and growth at Atacadão, the country’s biggest cash-and-carry chain.BEATEN ON ACQUISITION The cash-and-carry format, which features bulk sales of food and other items paid for in cash and carried out by the customers themselves, has emerged as a rare bright spot in Brazilian retail. Cheesewright said Maxxi was now one of Wal-Mart's best performing formats after it had narrowed its focus to small business owners, giving up on competing head-to-head with the larger warehouses of Atacadão, which caters to both business shoppers and an increasing number of thrifty families.  But after paring back to 44 locations, Maxxi gives Wal-Mart far less exposure to the cash-and-carry business than Atacadão and GPA's Assai, which have 123 and 95 stores, respectively. Some analysts and former executives say one of Wal-Mart’s biggest missteps was losing a bidding match for Atacadão to Carrefour, which paid $1.1 billion for it in 2007.Cheesewright said Wal-Mart was piloting a larger version of its Todo Dia discount format in part as a way to attract some of the family shoppers now using rival cash-and-carry stores. Other plans include renovating supermarkets with a slightly smaller assortment and a focus on fresh food. The task of making all that happen falls to Flavio Cotini, who was promoted this month from chief financial officer to head the Brazilian operations. The reshuffle marked the fourth leadership change in Brazil since 2008 -- a lack of continuity at the top that has exacerbated problems, including hindering efforts to integrate operations, former executives said.""

739,"  (Updating to fix formatting problem)By Brad Haynes and Nathan LayneCAMPO GRANDE, Brazil Feb 17 When Wal-Mart Stores Inc. first expanded into Brazil's midwestern farm-belt city of Campo Grande seven years ago, the economy was booming and executives were eager to open stores even in sub-prime locations on one-way streets heading out of town.It didn't last. At the end of December, the U.S. retailer closed both of its Maxxi brand cash-and-carry stores in Campo Grande as part of a restructuring that shuttered 60 locations across Brazil, including some Supercenters. Shoppers said the stores could not compete on assortment, price or location.""It was never clear who Maxxi was for. It wasn't cheap enough for the poor. But there was no appeal for the middle class,"" said Ordecy Gossler, 40, a public accountant filling his cart with cleaning supplies and toilet paper at Atacadão, a rival chain run by France's Carrefour.""When they announced in December that both Maxxis were closing, no one in my office knew where they were.""Today, Wal-Mart has just one Supercenter left in this city of 850,000 people, whose demographic of thrifty shoppers had once seemed suited to the world's largest retailer. It shuttered the city's other one at the end of the year, as traffic dwindled in the shopping mall it was meant to anchor.The retreat from Campo Grande is emblematic of Wal-Mart's broader issues in Brazil, a once-red-hot destination for foreign retailers and other companies that has turned stone cold. And the lackluster performance in Latin America's largest economy shows how tactics that helped Wal-Mart build success in the U.S. sometimes get badly lost in translation overseas.International results have been anemic, despite $22 billion in capital investment over the past five years. Wal-Mart last year generated a 4.5 percent operating profit margin from international markets, well below the 7.4 percent return posted from the U.S.Seeking higher returns, Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon in October announced a strategic review of the company's global assets. Some securities analysts have speculated Wal-Mart could exit Brazil, as well as other markets in Latin America where it is already closing an additional 55 stores.The pullback in Brazil also has some worrying echoes of previous Wal-Mart debacles overseas, including South Korea and Germany, two markets it abandoned in 2006.LABOR PROBLEMS In Brazil, it has been dogged by poor locations, inefficient operations, labor troubles and uncompetitive prices - with some of the problems baked in during an aggressive, decade-long growth surge - according to interviews with a dozen former and current Wal-Mart executives, as well as analysts, shoppers and store employees.For a graphic showing some of Wal-Mart's Brazil problems, see tmsnrt.rs/1oH9pNuWal-Mart would not comment on financial results from Brazil ahead of the company's quarterly earnings on Feb. 18. People familiar with the numbers told Reuters that Wal-Mart has posted operating losses in Brazil for each of the past seven years.Jo Newbould, a spokeswoman for the retailer, said the store closures were part of its efforts to ""actively manage"" its global assets and that it has been working to lower costs in Brazil. David Cheesewright, head of Wal-Mart's international operations, said in an interview that it has no plans to quit Brazil.He pointed to the company's decision to invest in completing an integration of legacy computer systems into the wider Wal-Mart platform as evidence of a commitment to the market. ""That's not the act of someone who is packing up the firm for other purposes,"" he said.Cheesewright expressed optimism about a turnaround. ""It's a market that has always been high on potential, but has been a roller-coaster ride in terms of its performance,"" he said. ""It happens to be on a downturn at the moment, and I'm sure it will do what it always has done, which is improve.""RUNAWAY GROWTH Wal-Mart first entered Brazil in 1995 and grew in measured steps for nearly a decade. That changed in 2004-2005, when it spent about $1 billion to buy two retailers, Bompreço S.A. Supermercados do Nordeste and Sonae Distribuição Brasil S.A.The deals expanded Wal-Mart's operations into the northeast and south of Brazil, and marked the beginning of a spending spree aimed at building a national footprint. With the takeovers came an array of brands: Wal-Mart currently operates under nine different store banners in Brazil.At the height of the expansion, former Wal-Mart executives said, a land rush mentality took hold. Brazil's thriving economy in those years convinced executives the biggest risk lay in moving too slowly. In response, they approved new store sites based on increasingly rosy forecasts of future sales. ""Most executives didn't have the voice to say, 'Don't open this store; let's not approve more stores,'"" a former finance executive recalled. ""Why not? Because Brazil was the new country. We needed to put investment in before others do.""In a six-year stretch through the fiscal year ending January 2013, Wal-Mart doubled its locations, reaching nearly 560 at its peak.The rapid expansion strained Wal-Mart's logistics --  traditionally one of its strong points in the U.S. but a drag on performance in Brazil.In some cases, delivery trucks drove days to reach distant stores from centrally located warehouses. Executives from headquarters bickered with those running some kinds of stores about who should bear the distribution costs, the former finance executive said.Amid the focus on growth, executives never fully integrated the legacy information systems from Bompreço and Sonae. Disruptions in communication between headquarters and the many different store types allowed inefficiencies to take root. Buyers, for instance, found themselves using three laptops, one each for the two legacy systems and another for the Wal-Mart platform, people familiar with the matter said.TAX ISSUES Cheesewright said he had put a priority on systems and would complete the integration by the middle of 2016. He said that would allow Brazil to benefit fully from system and process advancements made in the U.S., helping it to lower costs. He also said Wal-Mart was getting a grip on Brazil's complex tax system and litigious labor market, problems that have dogged it for years. In January 2014 Wal-Mart disclosed that unforeseen Brazil tax assessments and employment claims tied to a cost-cutting drive would slice 2 percent off its annual earnings globally. Labor claims in Brazil also hurt its results in the third quarter of the financial year that has just ended.Cheesewright said it was implementing a plan, including putting advanced time-keeping equipment in stores and getting workers to formally clock in, which should lower the risk of worker lawsuits.""A lot of the stuff in Brazil is just the basic stuff: do people properly clock out for their lunch breaks, do you manage overtime correctly, do they have the right breaks between shifts?"" he said. ""It's a lot of basic blocking and tackling.""Wal-Mart, whose sales at existing stores in the country edged down 0.6 percent in the August-October quarter, isn't the only retailer hurting in Brazil.With the economy in a deepening recession, market leader GPA , controlled by France's Casino, suffered a 2.3 percent sales drop at existing stores in the October-December quarter and has said it would slash investments in 2016.Carrefour bucked the trend, posting 8.5 percent growth in sales at existing stores, thanks to investments in hypermarkets and growth at Atacadão, the country's biggest cash-and-carry chain.BEATEN ON ACQUISITION The cash-and-carry format, which features bulk sales of food and other items paid for in cash and carried out by the customers themselves, has emerged as a rare bright spot in Brazilian retail.Cheesewright said Maxxi was now one of Wal-Mart's best performing formats after it had narrowed its focus to small business owners, giving up on competing head-to-head with the larger warehouses of Atacadão, which caters to both business shoppers and an increasing number of thrifty families.But after paring back to 44 locations, Maxxi gives Wal-Mart far less exposure to the cash-and-carry business than Atacadão and GPA's Assai, which have 123 and 95 stores, respectively. Some analysts and former executives say one of Wal-Mart's biggest missteps was losing a bidding match for Atacadão to Carrefour, which paid $1.1 billion for it in 2007.Cheesewright said Wal-Mart was piloting a larger version of its Todo Dia discount format in part as a way to attract some of the family shoppers now using rival cash-and-carry stores. Other plans include renovating supermarkets with a slightly smaller assortment and a focus on fresh food.The task of making all that happen falls to Flavio Cotini, who was promoted this month from chief financial officer to head the Brazilian operations.

743,"   By Nathan Layne  Wal-Mart Stores Inc on Thursday reported a lower quarterly profit and gave a lackluster sales outlook as declining prices for grocery products and sluggish apparel demand took a toll, and its shares fell more than 3 percent. Earnings at the world's largest retailer have been under pressure recently due to costs to raise entry-level wages, spruce up its stores and build out its e-commerce infrastructure as it grapples with faster-growing online rival Amazon.com Inc.Results for the fourth quarter ended on Jan. 31 show Wal-Mart is struggling to make those investments bring significant top-line growth, but it also suffers from a stronger dollar that has been slicing into the value of revenue generated overseas.The company said sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 0.6 percent from a year earlier. This was their sixth straight quarterly gain, but it missed market expectations for a rise of 1 percent.For the current quarter, Wal-Mart said it expected a U.S. same-store sales increase of 0.5 percent, slower than the year-earlier rise of 1.1 percent. The retailer also said it expected net sales to be flat in its new fiscal year, down from a previous forecast for 3 percent to 4 percent growth. The tepid sales forecast is troubling because it comes despite the investments in wages and renovations, Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said. He said some rival supermarket chains have been outperforming Wal-Mart in the grocery market.""It's the same old story,"" Yarbrough said. ""They continue to struggle to drive traffic and sales."" LOWER RESULTS Wal-Mart said fourth-quarter net income fell 7.9 percent to $4.57 billion, or $1.43 a diluted share. Excluding a charge for store closings and other items, earnings of $1.49 per share exceeded the analysts' average estimate of $1.46, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Wal-Mart announced last month that it would close 269 stores globally.     Consolidated revenue fell 1.4 percent to $129.7 billion, but Wal-Mart said it would have increased 2.2 percent if not for the dollar's rise.Greg Foran, head of Wal-Mart's U.S. business, said sales suffered from sluggish demand for winter clothes due to unusually warm weather that hurt most of the nation's retailers. The sales decline also reflected an industrywide drop in prices for meat, dairy and some other products, he said, and a delay in refund checks from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service curbed customers' spending. Foran said he was confident that various investments, such as to improve its fresh food section and expand grocery pickup, would yield results. He pointed to the $2.7 billion investment in higher employee pay, which includes a bump in the company's minimum wage to $10 an hour this month, as critical to accelerating growth. ""The labor investments that we are providing are absolutely crucial to improving the store experience and service to our customers, and I'm seeing that as I get around,"" Foran said on a call with reporters.Operating income in Wal-Mart's international business fell 19 percent to $1.7 billion, reflecting the firmer dollar, 115 store closures in Latin America, and tough market conditions in China, the United Kingdom and Brazil.

745,"  LONDON Feb 18 Supermarket chain Asda, the British arm of Wal-Mart, reported a 5.8 percent decline in underlying sales on Thursday in a further deterioration of its performance as it continues to lose shoppers to German discounters Aldi and Lidl.Asda's sixth straight quarter of decline follows a drop of 4.5 percent in the third querter and 4.7 percent in the second, which Chief Executive Andy Clarke had said was the company's ""nadir"". The 5.8 percent fall in the 13 weeks to Jan. 1, Asda's financial fourth quarter, cemented its position as the worst performer in revenue terms among Britain's four biggest supermarket chains. Asda's strategy in an environment where all Britain's supermarket companies are facing tough trading conditions because of industry deflation has been to protect profit margins rather than chase unprofitable sales. It said profitability in the quarter was stable.

746,"   By Nathan Layne  Wal-Mart Stores (WMT.N) said on Wednesday it would start offering fixed shifts and unveiled other details of planned scheduling changes aimed at retaining and motivating its rank-and-file workers.The changes are designed to offer employees greater control over their schedules, addressing an issue that has been a focus of labor activists who say retailers give little notice on shifts and generally exert too much control over worker hours.OUR Walmart, a labor group that has been pressuring the retailer on wages and benefits, described the move on scheduling as a positive step but said it believed Wal-Mart should still pay higher wages and offer more full-time jobs. Wal-Mart had flagged its intention to offer more reliable scheduling last year as part of a $2.7 billion investment in wages and training. Currently store managers allocate hours within the times employees say they are available to work.  Wal-Mart said that it would start introducing fixed shifts, under which workers can lock-in the same weekly hours, and flex shifts, which will allow workers to set their own schedules from a set of available time slots.The retailer aims to have the changes, which it has been piloting at 11 stores, in place at its roughly 4,600 locations by the end of 2016. The changes will not necessarily mean more hours for workers, whose options will still be limited based on when staffing is needed to match customer flow. ""Fixed schedules will provide associates a consistent schedule that does not change for up to a year,"" said Wal-Mart spokesman Kory Lundberg. ""Flex schedules offer flexibility for associates who want to choose their own schedules from shifts that vary according to customer demand.""The moves reflect broader efforts by Wal-Mart to motivate and retain its workforce of 1.3 million. Initial tests at pilot stores in Arkansas and Kansas showed an 11 percent drop in absenteeism and a 14 percent fall in turnover, Lundberg said.OUR Walmart issued a statement calling the scheduling changes a ""hard-won victory"" but said that workers still need better pay and additional hours to make ends meet. Jess Levin, spokeswoman for the United Food & Commercial Workers International Union, said some workers had complained about having their hours cut after the wage increase last year and urged the company to make sure better scheduling was made widely available. ""Walmart workers deserve the fair and flexible scheduling for which they have fought,"" Levin said in an emailed statement.

747,"   By Nathan Layne  Wal-Mart Stores Inc on Thursday reported a lower quarterly profit and gave a lackluster sales outlook as declining prices for grocery products and sluggish apparel demand took a toll, and its shares fell more than 3 percent. Earnings at the world's largest retailer have been under pressure recently due to costs to raise entry-level wages, spruce up its stores and build out its e-commerce infrastructure as it grapples with faster-growing online rival Amazon.com Inc.Results for the fourth quarter ended on Jan. 31 show Wal-Mart is struggling to make those investments bring significant top-line growth, but it also suffers from a stronger dollar that has been slicing into the value of revenue generated overseas.The company said sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 0.6 percent from a year earlier. This was their sixth straight quarterly gain, but it missed market expectations for a rise of 1 percent.For the current quarter, Wal-Mart said it expected a U.S. same-store sales increase of 0.5 percent, slower than the year-earlier rise of 1.1 percent. The retailer also said it expected net sales to be flat in its new fiscal year, down from a previous forecast for 3 percent to 4 percent growth. The tepid sales forecast is troubling because it comes despite the investments in wages and renovations, Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said. He said some rival supermarket chains have been outperforming Wal-Mart in the grocery market.""It's the same old story,"" Yarbrough said. ""They continue to struggle to drive traffic and sales."" LOWER RESULTS Wal-Mart said fourth-quarter net income fell 7.9 percent to $4.57 billion, or $1.43 a diluted share. Excluding a charge for store closings and other items, earnings of $1.49 per share exceeded the analysts' average estimate of $1.46, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Wal-Mart announced last month that it would close 269 stores globally.     Consolidated revenue fell 1.4 percent to $129.7 billion, but Wal-Mart said it would have increased 2.2 percent if not for the dollar's rise.Greg Foran, head of Wal-Mart's U.S. business, said sales suffered from sluggish demand for winter clothes due to unusually warm weather that hurt most of the nation's retailers. The sales decline also reflected an industrywide drop in prices for meat, dairy and some other products, he said, and a delay in refund checks from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service curbed customers' spending. Foran said he was confident that various investments, such as to improve its fresh food section and expand grocery pickup, would yield results. He pointed to the $2.7 billion investment in higher employee pay, which includes a bump in the company's minimum wage to $10 an hour this month, as critical to accelerating growth. ""The labor investments that we are providing are absolutely crucial to improving the store experience and service to our customers, and I'm seeing that as I get around,"" Foran said on a call with reporters.Operating income in Wal-Mart's international business fell 19 percent to $1.7 billion, reflecting the firmer dollar, 115 store closures in Latin America, and tough market conditions in China, the United Kingdom and Brazil. The company said its Mexican and Canadian businesses performed well during the quarter.Fourth-quarter e-commerce sales rose 8 percent, excluding currency moves, continuing a deceleration from growth of 17 percent in the first quarter, 16 percent in the second and 10 percent in the third.

""The customer is reacting positively to that,"" he said.The soft showing in Brazil reflects an economic slump impacting all retailers, while Wal-Mart's struggles in China are partly due to gains by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, a factor also likely cutting into Amazon's sales there, Profitero's Anderson said. But Wal-Mart's slowing growth also highlights broader challenges of logistics and price competitiveness, including in the key U.S. market, Anderson said.According to a recent Profitero survey of 2,461 products, Amazon had lower online prices than both Target and Wal-Mart across six product categories.

752,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Target Corp's (TGT.N) quarterly sales at established stores topped analysts' estimates as its initiatives around higher-profit items drove traffic, showing that the company's turnaround efforts under CEO Brian Cornell were gaining traction.The U.S. retailer, whose shares rose as much as 4 percent to $76.95, also forecast a higher-than-expected adjusted profit for the full year.Same-store sales at rival Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) missed market expectations last week, hurt by a strong dollar and sluggish apparel demand.Target's apparel sales rose in the fourth quarter, in contrast to weak sales at several retailers including Ralph Lauren Corp (RL.N) and Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N).Cornell, Target's chief executive since August 2014, has been aggressively trying to turnaround the company after several years of sluggish growth.Some of his efforts include promoting and investing in a narrower set of higher-margin ""signature"" categories such as baby and health and wellness, and pulling out of Canada. Comparable sales in higher-margin categories rose by more than three times the company average in the quarter ended Jan. 30, Target said, with  women's apparel, wearable electronics and food being the fastest growing.""Signs that CEO Cornell's strategic initiatives are gaining traction include: 'signature' categories re-accelerating to about 6 percent growth and traffic rising 1.3 percent,"" Sterne Agee analyst Renato Basanta said.Apparel sales were helped by better in-store and online presentation and the stocking of trendier styles, Target finance chief Cathy Smith said on a media call. ""We believe that Target performed somewhat above the market (in apparel) thanks to its more fashion-savvy shopper demographic and its strong marketing efforts around holiday looks,"" Neil Saunders, CEO of research firm Conlumino, wrote in a note.Concerns about a slowdown in Target's digital sales were also alleviated by its 34 percent growth in the quarter, Sterne Agee's Basanta said, terming it ""solid progress for Target's still nascent platform.""The concerns stem from Target's warning in November that it would miss its target of growing online sales by 40 percent in 2015 due to slowing electronic sales.

756,"   By Nathan Layne  Sam's Club, the warehouse club unit of Wal-Mart Stores Inc, is building a team of regional U.S. buyers to bring in more local and organic groceries, a strategy used by rival Costco Wholesale Corp to drive loyalty and attract wealthier customers.Attracting and keeping customers has taken on a new importance for Sam's Club after a 0.5-percent fall in sales at existing stores in the quarter ending in January, the first drop since early 2014. Costco, by comparison, posted rises in each month of the quarter and has outgrown Sam's for years.    Sam's Club has hired a handful of buyers in Dallas and is considering putting teams in up to five other markets, John Furner, chief merchandising officer at Sam's Club, told Reuters. Until now, all of its buyers have worked out of company headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas.Buyers find and purchase the products that end up on the shelf. Having them closer to local markets will make it easier to forge ties with up-and-coming suppliers of organic, healthy and premium foods, as well as products catering to local tastes, Furner said.""(Such items) end up by default being local products and regional products,"" Furner said in an interview, citing organics, craft beer and ""unique salsas"" as examples of the types of product buyers would look to bring into the club. People familiar with the matter said Sam's Club was considering having regional buyers handle 30 percent of its food items. Furner said he did not yet have a unit target and that his first priority was to make the Dallas operation successful before setting further plans.   Furner said a stronger pipeline of organic and premium foods would help attract wealthier shoppers, a key plank of Sam's growth strategy and increasingly the target demographic for warehouse clubs.  Costco has a location advantage when it comes to upscale shoppers, with many of its stores in wealthier regions near cities and along the coasts. Sam's Club stores are often located in less well-to-do areas; more than a quarter of its roughly 650 stores are next to a Walmart, which tends to attract a lower-income shopper.Costco has grown into one of the largest U.S. food retailers, selling more than $4 billion worth of organic products annually, surpassing even Whole Foods, according to a BMO Capital Markets research report last year. Sam's Club, which gets more than half its revenues from groceries and consumables, does not disclose its organic sales.Costco's decentralized organization, with buyers spread out across a network of regional offices, has also been critical to its success, enabling it to procure more local and exclusive items that drive ""excitement and retention"", said Sara Al-Tukhaim, a director at research firm Kantar Retail. A Kantar survey found ""high quality perishables"" such as meat and prepared fresh meals were a major factor in membership renewal for about one-third of Costco shoppers. At Sam's Club such food drives retention 23 percent of the time.""If I'm a shopper and I'm paying for a membership I want only the most relevant items in the club. I want something that speaks directly to me,"" Al-Tukhaim said. ""Costco has had a very longstanding regional buying structure where they have been able to do that.""

763,"  Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) said it will build a dairy processing plant in Indiana to supply private-label milk to about 600 stores, curtailing business with some suppliers in the retailer's sole foray into food processing in the United States.The move - announced by Wal-Mart on Friday but not widely reported by media until Tuesday - helped spark a 12 percent slide in shares of Dean Foods Co (DF.N), one of the suppliers of milk to the affected stores.In a securities filing on Tuesday, Dean Foods said the change by Wal-Mart could lead to the loss of 100 million gallons of ""very low-margin private-label fluid milk volume"" from late 2017. It said it did not expect any impact on the supply of its own national brands and would not be material on its results.Wal-Mart confirmed that Dean Foods would continue to supply milk for its Great Value and Member's Mark private label white and chocolate milk to other Walmart supermarkets and Sam's Club membership-based wholesale stores. The retailing giant is the largest grocer in the U.S. with more than 5,000 locations. The move comes with Wal-Mart's profits weighed down by costs to increase wages and invest in its e-commerce operations. The retailer is also facing tough competition from Kroger (KR.N)  and other national and regional grocery chains and has recently ratcheted up pressure on suppliers to help it lower costs.""This is a smart investment that enables us to aggressively manage costs, keep prices low for our customers and remain competitive with the majority of major grocery chains already bottling their own milk,"" said spokesman John Forrest Ales.

766,"   By Nathan Layne  A U.S. district court judge on Monday struck down a tax levied by Puerto Rico on retailer Wal-Mart Stores , dealing a blow to the debt-laden U.S. territory's efforts to shore up its finances.Implemented last year, the measure had increased the tax for on-island companies with more than $2.75 billion in revenues that buy goods from off-island ""related parties"" to 6.5 percent from 2 percent.Wal-Mart argued that it was the only company with that level of sales and sued Puerto Rico Treasury Secretary Juan Zaragoza-Gomez in December, saying the tax violated the commerce clause of the U.S. constitution by unfairly taxing interstate commerce.In court papers filed ahead of the trial, in U.S. District Court in San Juan, the retailer said it was being taxed at 114 percent of net taxable income. San Juan district judge Jose Fuste found that the tax ""on its face, clearly discriminates against interstate commerce"" while also pointing to Puerto Rico's dire finances, which he said would invalidate the argument that any company could seek refunds on the taxes in the future by challenging it in court.""That is the very definition of an inadequate remedy,"" the judge wrote in the 109-page ruling.

771,"   By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected two corporate challenges in class action cases, refusing to hear bids by Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Wells Fargo & Co to throw out large judgments against them.Wal-Mart had sought to get rid of a $187 million class action judgment over the retailer's treatment of workers in Pennsylvania. Wells Fargo & Co wanted the justices to toss a $203 million judgment over allegations the bank had imposed excessive overdraft fees.The court's decisions on whether to hear the cases had been on hold pending its action in a separate class action case involving Tyson Foods Inc.On March 22, the court in that case backed workers at a pork facility in Iowa who said they were entitled to overtime pay and damages because they were not paid for the time spent putting on and taking off protective equipment and walking to work stations.Entering the court's current term, which began in October, the justices had issued a series of rulings in recent years clamping down on class action litigation, a goal of big business. But that trend has not continued. The court has heard three important class action cases this term. In January, it ruled against advertising firm Campbell-Ewald and in March ruled against Tyson Foods.The justices have yet to issue a ruling in a case argued in November in which online people-search service Spokeo Inc sought to avoid a class action lawsuit for including incorrect information in its database. In declining to hear Wal-Mart's appeal, the court left intact a 2014 ruling by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court that largely upheld a lower court judgment awarding the $187 million to the plaintiffs.The case affects about 187,000 Wal-Mart employees who worked in Pennsylvania between 1998 and 2006. ""We are disappointed the Supreme Court decided not to review our case. While we continue to believe these claims should not be bundled together in a class action lawsuit, we respect the court's decision,"" a Wal-Mart spokesman said. The Pennsylvania court mostly upheld a 2007 lower court ruling in favor of the employees, who said the company failed to pay them for all hours worked and prevented them from taking full meal and rest breaks. The appeals court threw out a $37 million attorneys' fee award and ordered the trial court to recalculate that portion of the judgment. In the Wells Fargo case, the justices left in place a 2014 ruling by the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upholding the class action judgment against the bank.

Wal-Mart has made expanding its online assortment, currently at about 9 million items, a priority for its online business this year.While Wal-Mart procures and warehouses many of the high-volume products on its own, like other retailers it has turned to third-party sellers to round out its assortment. That includes online industry leader Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), which has more than 200 million products for sale.The move to expand its product line-up follows major investments on new distribution facilities dedicated to filling e-commerce orders and on an in-house technology platform that has boosted its capacity to process and analyze data. Seth Beal, head of Wal-Mart's online marketplace, said the retailer could expand the number of third-party sellers, currently less than 500, into the thousands as early as this year. He declined to give a specific timetable.""We think that number will be in the thousands pretty quickly,"" Beal said in an interview. ChannelAdvisor says it has more than 2,800 customers globally and that $6.8 billion, measured in gross merchandise value terms, ran through its platform last year. It connects sellers with marketplaces such as those run by Amazon and Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD.O) as well as search engines and comparison sites.Beal said Wal-Mart would not automatically open up its website to all sellers on the ChannelAdvisor platform but that the partnership would make the process easier.

782,"   By Nathan Layne  Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) is expanding free curbside pickup of groceries into eight new cities this month including Kansas City and Austin as the retailer gains confidence it can make the strategy work on a larger scale, a senior executive told Reuters.The expansion, which includes adding stores in markets where it already has a presence, will increase the number of stores with the service by a third to about 200 and widen its footprint to 30 cities, Michael Bender, chief operating officer of Wal-Mart's e-commerce operations, said in an interview on Monday.Bender said that Wal-Mart was preparing to expand further beyond this move, which could suggest the retailer may look to roll out the service to a more sizeable portion of its nearly 4,600 stores across the United States.""The data we’ve collected gives us confidence that with existing customers we are getting a larger share of their wallet and that's complemented by new customers we are bringing into the fold,"" he said. ""There will be more so stay tuned.""By focusing on in-store pickup, Wal-Mart is aiming to capitalize on its network of stores, drawing a sharp contrast with Amazon.com (AMZN.O), an online-only retailer which has struggled to find the right pricing model and is delivering groceries in a handful of cities for a fee.  Other traditional supermarkets are also trying to figure out a profitable way to sell groceries online. Kroger (KR.N) offers pickup at 47 locations and more than a 100 stores in its Harris Teeter chain, a company spokesman said. Kroger charges $4.95 per order after the first three orders. Wal-Mart does not have pickup fees. Bender said customer satisfaction scores in its own surveys from the 150 stores and 22 cities it had expanded to in October were in the mid to high 90's. He said the service was very popular among mothers with children who like having groceries delivered to their trunk without having to leave the car.In addition to Kansas City, Missouri and Austin, Texas, Wal-Mart will roll out the service later this month to select stores in Boise, Idaho; Richmond and Virginia Beach, Virginia; Provo, Utah; Daphne, Alabama and Charleston, South Carolina.Shoppers can choose from about 30,000 to 40,000 mainly grocery items, roughly the same assortment as in stores. After ordering and paying online, customers drive to the store at a designated time and a ""personal shopper"" - a new position that has been added to handle the job - brings the groceries to your car. The push in online grocery dovetails with a $2.7 billion investment that Wal-Mart has made over two years into boosting worker wages and in training, steps that it hopes will improve its customer service and translate into higher sales.Bender said the ""personal shoppers"" are getting to know their customers, such as how ripe they like their bananas, and sees grocery pickup as one way to ""help change the perception of the service at Wal-Mart.""

The pilot program was started last year, in part to counter the growth of a shipping plan offered by rival Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) for a $99 annual fee.As part of a push to speed up deliveries, Wal-Mart will turn to regional carriers for an increasing number of its packages, according to a person familiar with the matter. That could cut into the share of parcels delivered by FedEx Corp (FDX.N), which handles the bulk of Wal-Mart's packages. Wal-Mart has earmarked $2 billion in spending on digital projects and its e-commerce infrastructure over the two fiscal years to January 2017. Some of that investment will go toward large warehouses dedicated to filling online orders efficiently.The warehouses of about one million square feet in size, big enough to house two cruise liners, will utilize sophisticated computer programs and automated conveyor belts to sift and pack parcels efficiently. The company will open the eighth such facility in Florida later this year. Those warehouses are fed in part by more than 150 distribution centers located across the U.S. Wal-Mart also fills online orders from about 80 stores, where workers pull products off shelves, put them in boxes and ship them to homes.

A Delaware judge on Friday dismissed a lawsuit by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. shareholders who accused the board of the world's largest retailer of trying to cover up bribes paid by company executives in Mexico.Chancellor Andre Bouchard of the Court of Chancery in Wilmington said an earlier dismissal by an Arkansas judge of a nearly identical lawsuit by another group of shareholders precluded the Delaware case from going forward.He said that while the Arkansas plaintiffs may have chosen to rush their case rather than fully investigate alleged wrongdoing, their haste did not disqualify them from representing Wal-Mart shareholders.""We believe that the Arkansas ruling is correct and have said all along that the Walmart Board of Directors has the appropriate authority to conduct an investigation into the matters alleged in these cases,"" Wal-Mart spokesman Randy Hargrove said in a statement. Friday's decision is a loss for the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS) and New York City pension funds that had brought the Delaware case. Their lawyer, Stuart Grant, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The litigation stemmed from a 2012 New York Times investigation that found Wal-Mart had engaged in a multi-year bribery campaign to build its Wal-Mart de Mexico business.According to the newspaper, Wal-Mart sent investigators to Mexico City and found a paper trail of suspect payments totaling more than $24 million. However, top executives shut down the internal probe and did not notify U.S. or Mexican law enforcement until after the newspaper had informed Wal-Mart that it was looking into the issue.The Delaware lawsuit sought to hold Wal-Mart directors liable for damages they caused the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer, in what is known as a derivative lawsuit. Successful derivative cases usually result in corporate governance changes. While the Delaware shareholders were fighting for company documents to bolster their case, a federal judge dismissed a parallel derivative case in Arkansas for failing to prove the board was too conflicted to investigate itself.That ruling has been appealed.In his 60-page decision, Bouchard said the Arkansas plaintiffs' strategy ""does not rise to the level of litigation management that was so grossly deficient as to render them inadequate representatives"" of Wal-Mart shareholders.The Wall Street Journal in October said a U.S. probe into the alleged corruption uncovered few major offenses, and that Wal-Mart might be able to settle with a fine and no criminal charges being brought.

802,"   By Nathan Layne  Retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) said on Monday that it was expanding joint procurement of generic drugs with U.S. drug distributor McKesson (MCK.N) to lower costs as it battles drug inflation and other pressures on its pharmacy business margins.Wal-Mart, which has been sourcing generics with McKesson for several years, has been looking to strengthen its health-related business as well as cut costs in its pharmacy operations, which emerged as a significant drag on earnings last year.The deal is aimed at ""using our combined size and scale to drive efficiencies,"" George Riedl, senior vice president and president of the health and wellness division at Wal-Mart in the United States, said in a statement.For McKesson, the deal, which includes expanding a long-term distribution agreement, means a bigger role in sourcing most of the 6,000-plus generic drugs sold by Wal-Mart in the United States. Shares of McKesson rose 4.1 percent to $172.80 on the news.  Wal-Mart said in August that margins in its pharmacy business were being pinched by reduced reimbursement rates from drug plan administers as well as fewer people paying in cash, significant because cash transactions fetch higher margins.In October, Greg Foran, head of Wal-Mart's U.S. operations, told investors that the company was working on several measures to ""help offset some of the reimbursement pressures that we are seeing and we expect to see in the foreseeable future."" While Wal-Mart expects the McKesson deal to boost its buying power, it does not see it leading to lower prices for consumers. That is partly due to inflation, with U.S. prescription drug prices overall rising 10.4 percent in 2015 and generics up 2.9 percent, according to healthcare research firm Truveris.""While we don’t foresee a change in the pricing of generic drugs, we will be able to be more efficient, remain a competitive force in the pharmacy space, and continue to ultimately lower the cost of healthcare,"" Wal-Mart spokesman Randy Hargrove said. Since 2006, Wal-Mart has offered customers a 30-day prescription for more than 200 generic drugs for $4. It does not expect that offering, including the price, to change as a result of the expanded alliance with McKesson.Wal-Mart was the third-biggest bricks-and-mortar U.S. pharmacy in 2015 with $19.9 billion in prescription sales, according to Pembroke Consulting.

810,"   By Nathan Layne  Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) on Thursday reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit as increased drug prices and solid demand for basic apparel items boosted sales, and its shares jumped more than 9 percent.The discount retailer's performance bucked a string of weak results from competitors. On Wednesday, rival Target Corp (TGT.N), which caters to a higher-income customer than Wal-Mart, gave a cautious outlook and reported a lower-than-expected rise in quarterly sales due to unseasonable weather and soft demand.""It looks like the middle-to-higher-income customers have cut back, but the lower-income customer is spending,"" said Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough.    While Target cited sluggish demand for clothing and electronics, Wal-Mart said its sales of those products picked up. Even the mild weather provided a boost by lowering the cost of heating the company's more than 5,000 U.S. stores.The upbeat results also suggest Wal-Mart may be benefiting from a two-year, $2.7 billion investment to increase entry-level wages and train its workforce, and a campaign to make its stores cleaner and checkouts faster. Store visits increased 1.5 percent in the first quarter ended on April 29.Greg Foran, who heads the U.S. division, said dozens of improvements, like cleaner parking lots, better presentation of fresh food and inventory management changes that led to more fully stocked shelves, were boosting demand.""As you gradually improve on these 100-plus aspects, then the customer gets a better experience that's reflected in them coming to visit you more often and (putting) one extra item in the trolley,"" Foran said on a call with reporters.

While its listed British rivals have all reported profit declines and asset write-offs, Asda has maintained yearly profit at about 1 billion pounds ($1.46 billion).“The UK continues to struggle, due primarily to fierce competition,"" said Wal-Mart’s Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs.""Improvements in price and product availability throughout the quarter were not enough to overcome traffic and food volume declines in our large format stores."" Asda Chief Executive Andy Clarke prematurely called last year's second quarter the firm's ""nadir"" when underlying sales  fell 4.7 percent.Clarke is attempting to recoup sales by cutting prices to narrow the gap with the discounters and widen its price advantage over its three biggest rivals. It is also in the middle of a program to overhaul its product range, modernize its 95 largest stores and reduce costs.However, monthly industry data shows it has continued to lose market share.

818,"   By Lisa Baertlein   (This version of the May 25 story corrects paragraph eight to show that Trader Joe's sells produce by piece and package, not by the pound)By Lisa BaertleinLOS ANGELES Whole Foods Market Inc (WFM.O) unveils its new 365 grocery chain on Wednesday with a bright and airy store that offers lower prices and more technology than the company's namesake shops. To thrive, though, experts say 365 has to beat its many rivals without hijacking customers from Whole Foods itself.The chain, which debuts in Los Angeles' Silver Lake neighborhood, is critical to Whole Foods. In the fiercely competitive market for fresh fruit and vegetables, its sales are being whittled away by Sprouts Farmers Market Inc (SFM.O) and other rivals who are undercutting Whole Foods on price, if not always matching it on quality.Low prices are the top demand even among shoppers prioritizing goods promoting health and wellness, said Richard Vitaro of market research firm AlixPartners. ""I don't think we can underestimate the power of frugality,"" said Vitaro.From the start, 365 has targeted reduced overheads and increased customer convenience, said Jeff Turnas, president of the chain. Whole Foods said recently it has signed 19 leases for 365 stores around the United States, without disclosing financial targets for the new chain.""Our goal is to compete in the marketplace without lowering the Whole Foods standards,"" Turnas told Reuters during a recent store tour. He said 365 stores will complement Whole Foods' premium, full-service sister brand - often dubbed 'Whole Paycheck' in popular culture in reference to its perceived higher prices.  But the new chain will have to work hard to avoid being labeled ""a cheaper Whole Foods"", said Kevin Kelley, a principal at strategy and design firm Shook Kelley, which has worked with Whole Foods and other grocers. AIR GUITARS, FOODIES 365's messaging is breezier than its serious elder sibling's. One sign offers ""Free air guitars"", while a ""Silver Kale"" mural next to the meat case is a fun, foodie nod to the chain's first neighborhood, known for a hipster feel. About half of the brightly colored fruits and vegetables at 365 are non-organic, a greater proportion than at Whole Foods. Produce is priced per piece or per package, as at cult discounter Trader Joe's, rather than by the pound.365 stores will be about a third smaller than the average Whole Foods outlet, and carry roughly a quarter the number of products - reducing real estate and merchandise-related costs.Staffing is leaner and no longer specialized. An iPad app replaces wine experts, while meat, cheese and fish are in ""grab-and-go"" packages - meaning no butchers or cheese and fishmongers.    While 365 takes aim at budget gourmets and cash-strapped ""millennial moms"", grocery experts said it also needs to appeal to people who buy from a range of other food sellers, from Kroger (KR.N) and Walmart (WMT.N) to Amazon.com (AMZN.O), restaurant delivery companies and meal kit providers such as Blue Apron. Some are skeptical that 365 stores will hit the mark. ""I don't see them generating the efficiency they need to balance value and quality,"" said Bill Bishop of retail consultancy Brick Meets Click. Shook Kelley principal Kevin Kelley disagreed: ""Whole Foods gets culture,"" he said, and has the experience to successfully choose what goes on the shelves in smaller 365 stores.Roger Davidson, a consultant who has held key positions at chains such as Wild Oats, which was acquired by Whole Foods, Walmart and Texas grocer H-E-B, is betting on 365 succeeding. But amid intensive competition in the sector, Davidson said 365 has little room for error. ""They have to make it work,"" he said.

Federal regulators are still considering rules for commercial operation of drones that would be involved in package delivery - viewed as the next frontier for big retailers such as Walmart and Amazon Inc (AMZN.O). Walmart's Vice President of Last Mile and Emerging Sciences Shekar Natarajan demonstrated the use of drones to reporters in one of the company's regional distribution centers.

Natarajan said drones can reduce the labor intensive process of checking stocks around the warehouse to one day. It currently takes a month to finish manually. Finding ways to more efficiently warehouse, transport and deliver goods to customers has taken on new importance for Wal-Mart as it deals with wages costs while seeking to beat back price competition and boost online sales.

847,"   By Lauren Hirsch and Adam Jourdan | NEW YORK/SHANGHAI  NEW YORK/SHANGHAI Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) has sold its Chinese online grocery store in return for a stake in the country's no. 2 e-commerce firm, ripping up its previous strategy in efforts to cure ailing sales in one of the world's toughest retail markets.The deal will see the U.S. grocery giant swap its Yihaodian platform for a 5 percent stake in JD.com Inc (JD.O), worth about $1.5 billion by the firm's latest market value. The move also gives Wal-Mart a ringside seat in JD.com's bitter rivalry with Chinese e-commerce leader Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N).  The sell-off, announced on Monday, is a significant shift for Wal-Mart in China, where it operates more than 400 bricks-and-mortar stores. The firm has been shuttering underperforming outlets and grappling with soft online sales in the world's second-biggest economy since it bought full control of Yihaodian in July last year, saying the site would play a leading role in its China strategy.""The reality is that e-commerce is hyper-competitive in China and it is tough for any platform to make money,"" said Ben Cavender, Shanghai-based principal of China Market Research Group. ""Selling up in return for a 5 percent stake in JD.com is a good way of staying in the space while reducing the risk.""The deal echoes a strategy adopted by other international retailers and consumer goods makers - selling a local unit for a stake in a Chinese partner in order to prosper in a cut-throat marketplace. France's Danone SA (DANO.PA) sold its Dumex brand last year to raise its stake in local dairy giant China Mengniu Dairy Co Ltd (2319.HK). Wal-Mart's tie-up gives it access to JD.com's nationwide logistics and warehousing networks, as well as its over 150 million users - helping expand the U.S. firm's reach with China's increasingly tech-savvy middle class. For JD.com, the deal could provide a boost in its intensifying competition in the fast-growing online grocery business with Alibaba - a market set to boom to nearly $180 billion by 2020 from $41 billion last year, according to data from food research body IGD.Under the deal, JD.com will issue around 145 million new class A shares to Wal-Mart. JD.com will take ownership of Yihaodian, although the platform will continue to be operated by Wal-Mart. The world's biggest retailer had previously talked up Yihaodian as playing a key role in turning around its China business. Wal-Mart has worked to turn around falling same-store sales in China, where the firm said in May it was facing a ""challenging macroeconomic environment"".Analysts said that while Wal-Mart would give up a large amount of control and potential future profits from the business, the tie-up would allow the U.S. firm to concentrate on turning around its offline stores. ""It doesn't mean that (Wal-Mart has) pulled away, but to me it tells me they are trying to make smarter investments,"" said Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough. Wal-Mart's financial adviser on the deal was Morgan Stanley & Co LLC and its legal advisor was  Morrison & Foerster LLP.

860,"  BANGKOK Thai Union Group Plc (TU.BK), the world's largest canned tuna producer, said on Tuesday it would buy a majority stake in Canadian lobster processor Les Pecheries de Chez Nous (Chez Nous) for an undisclosed amount. Thai Union, which makes the ""Chicken of the Sea"" brand and counts Wal-Mart and Costco among its buyers, will give financial details about the deal in August, it said in a statement. Francois ""Frankie"" Benoit, the existing owner and chief executive of Chez Nous, will retain a minority share in the company which had sales of about C$50 million in 2015, the Thai firm said. The deal comes after Thai Union's Tri-Union Frozen Products unit acquired Orion Seafood International in 2015, making it one of the largest sellers of North Atlantic lobster in the United States.  Thai Union has been looking for more acquisitions after it scrapped a $1.5 billion deal to buy U.S. rival Bumble Bee Seafoods in December.

868,"  CHICAGO Wal-Mart Stores Inc has begun rolling out specialized carts designed to keep employees out on the floor culling produce and reducing wastage, the latest step in a push to improve its fresh food offerings and revive sales growth.    The world's largest retailer has deployed what it calls ""quality carts"" at 500 stores and plans to have them in all of its nearly 5,000 U.S. outlets by the end of the third quarter, Vice President for Central Operations Shana DeSmit told Reuters in an interview.      The carts, equipped with weighing scales and a box to collect the discarded produce, will help employees carry out tasks that were typically carried out in the back room, she said. With the carts, employees can sort fresh produce by removing items nearing expiration and weighing them to manage inventory counts and help with replenishment. Wal-Mart's service levels have suffered due to fewer employees in store interacting with consumers.DeSmit said the retailer is introducing one such cart per store and will eventually add more. The produce collected through the carts is either donated or sold through markdowns.         A renewed emphasis on fresh food, which includes produce, deli items, meat and baked goods, has been a crucial turnaround strategy under U.S Chief Executive Officer Greg Foran. Wal-Mart is the largest grocer in the United States, with nationwide sales of $167 billion last year.     In recent months, Wal-Mart has started revamping the layout of the food section at 3,000 stores, including super­centers and its smaller Neighborhood Market stores. It has taken steps such as lowering display cases and opening up floor space so that shoppers can see more clearly across the food area, and has replaced black plastic crates with ones that look like wood to give the store more of a farmer's market feel.     In February, the retailer said it would hire hundreds of fresh food managers to improve its offerings. The company is on schedule to have such managers in a third of its stores nationwide by the end of the year, Wal-Mart spokesman Lorenzo Lopez said.

872,"   By David Randall | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Amazon's long shadow is falling on retailers previously thought immune to the threat of e-commerce, forcing U.S. fund managers to rethink their approach to consumer stocks by focusing on companies whose businesses cannot be upended by the online giant.At the core of the problem: Amazon.com Inc, once thought of as a place to buy books and household goods, is on track to become the largest apparel retailer in the United States by 2017, according to estimates from Cowen and Co, displacing department store operator Macy's Inc. Amazon's push into higher-end clothing over the last three years only adds to its dominance in e-commerce overall, with a nearly 40 percent market share, one that is larger than the next 21 retailers combined - a group that includes Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Best Buy Co Inc, according to research firm Slice Intelligence. Amazon shares hit a record high on Monday, day ahead of its Prime Day sales event. By market value, the company surpassed Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ""Retail is a landmine and you just don’t know who is going to be disrupted by Amazon. You are seeing money rotate into names where people feel comfortable with companies that won’t be Amazon'ed away,” said Scott Moore, a portfolio manager at Buffalo Funds.

Overall, actively managed large-cap funds now hold more restaurant, home improvement, and leisure stocks - all sectors in which Amazon does not yet compete -  than at any other time in the last five years, according to Morningstar data, while they have steadily cut holdings of apparel and department stores over the same period. The number of large-cap funds that own shares of Amazon, meanwhile, has risen 15 percent over the last three years.  Susan Bao, a co-portfolio manager of the $9.9 billion JP Morgan Large-Cap Core fund, said she no longer holds traditional retailers such as Macy's or Target Corp, and does not expect to do so again. Instead, she is focusing on companies such as cruise-ship operator Carnival Corp, which should benefit from an improving jobs market. ""This is one of companies that's going to do better when the consumer is in better shape that's also Amazon-proof,"" she said. Shares of Carnival are down 13.8 percent year to date, in part because of fears of the Zika virus, while Amazon's stock is up 10.8 percent over the same time.  Fund managers who are bullish on department stores say that Amazon will likely continue to dominate the retail industry even as Macy's and others expand their online businesses. Lawrence Haverty, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said that he expects Sears Holding Corp to fold ""within the next calendar year,"" sending more shoppers to rivals such as JC Penney Company Inc at a time when the company is in the middle of a corporate turnaround that has helped it produce solid same-store sales growth.

He noted that Sainsbury's has the nationwide store network, with large fresh food ranges in all of them, and the online retail knowledge, to provide such a service if the market develops.Amazon launched Prime Now in London a year ago and it is now available to more than 30 percent of the UK population.The mobile app is available to Prime members and offers one-hour delivery on more than 15,000 items for 6.99 pounds, or delivery at no extra charge within a choice of two-hour, same-day delivery slots. Items available include essentials such as fresh milk, nappies, coffee and chocolate, as well as games consoles, toys, gifts and sports equipment.Last month Amazon also launched a British version of its U.S. AmazonFresh food delivery service, stepping up the pressure on the traditional big supermarkets. Coupe also told the Bernstein analysts that he sees no reason for rival Asda, under new CEO Sean Clarke, ""to go hard on price"", seeing his most likely action as moves to improve store standards, service and availability. Speculation of a racheting-up of an industry price war has been rife since Wal-Mart, Asda's American owner, said last month it would shift the balance of Asda's strategy from protecting profits to protecting market share.

878,"   By Daniel Wiessner  Wal-Mart Stores Inc and the five female former employees who brought a nationwide sex discrimination lawsuit against the retail giant have agreed to settle the outstanding claims in the case after 15 years of litigation that spawned a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision. Wal-Mart, represented by Gibson Dunn & Crutcher, and lawyers from Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll, who are representing Betty Dukes and the other plaintiffs, said in a joint filing in federal court in San Francisco on Friday that they had reached a confidential agreement in the 2001 lawsuit. But, a day earlier, Cohen Milstein had moved on behalf of six different former class members to intervene in the case and keep it alive.

879,"  Wal-Mart Stores Inc said on Wednesday it was pushing suppliers to remove or restrict the use of eight hazardous chemicals from products including household cleaning, personal care and beauty items.The retailer named the chemicals including formaldehyde, a carcinogen found in wood products and building materials, in the wake of pressure from consumers who are increasingly becoming conscious of what goes into their food and household items.Target Corp also moved last year to remove more than 1,000 chemicals from its household cleaning, personal care and beauty products, and has been promoting the products that comply.  The chemicals Wal-Mart wants to remove include butylparaben, used as a preservative in cosmetics, and triclosan, used in  clothing, kitchenware, furniture and toys. Triclosan is also used in toothpaste, but Wal-Mart said it would not press for its removal because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other regulators have deemed it safe for this use.Procter & Gamble, a major supplier to Wal-Mart, uses parabens within safe limits set by scientific and regulatory agencies and their presence is disclosed on labels, according to the company website.It also said it had eliminated triclosan from more than 99 percent of the products where it was used and had an exit plan for the few remaining. Wal-Mart committed in 2013 to increase transparency about ingredients in products it sells, advance safer formulations and attain the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Safer Choice certification for its private brand products. The policy, effective from January 2014, focuses on products sold at Walmart and Sam's Club stores in the United States, according to the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), which said it worked with Wal-Mart to develop and implement its policy. (bit.ly/2auuSDA) Wal-Mart said in April that its suppliers had removed 95 percent of the eight high-priority chemicals by volume weight from the products it sells in the United States.""These eight chemicals and chemical classes were among the most ubiquitous found in home and personal care products sold at Walmart,"" the EDF said in a statement. Wal-Mart's policy also requires that the use of any priority chemical must be disclosed on its packaging starting 2018, EDF said.

881,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) executives and directors persuaded a federal appeals court on Friday to reject shareholder claims that they permitted and then covered up pervasive bribery by officials at the world's largest retailer's Mexico unit.By a 3-0 vote, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis upheld a lower court dismissal of a federal lawsuit accusing the defendants, including former chief executives Mike Duke and Lee Scott, of breaching their duties in failing to stop alleged bribery at Wal-Mart de Mexico.Chief Judge William Riley said the claims ""do not give rise to a reasonable inference that Wal-Mart's board of directors learned of the suspected bribery by Wal-Mex while the alleged bribery was being covered up and the internal investigation quashed.""The decision could spell the end of derivative litigation, where shareholders seek to hold company officials liable for damages, stemming from the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer's 2012 bribery scandal.On May 13, a Delaware state judge dismissed a similar case, saying the April 2015 dismissal of the federal lawsuit by U.S. District Judge Susan Hickey in Arkansas precluded him from acting. Friday's decision upheld Hickey's dismissal. Judy Scolnick, a lawyer for the shareholders, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Wal-Mart's market value fell by roughly $17 billion over three days in April 2012, after The New York Times published a Pulitzer Prize-winning report saying the retailer paid bribes to Mexican officials to help it open stores faster. Shareholders claimed that Wal-Mart's board was put on notice about the bribery as early as 2005, when company investigators reported their early findings to audit committee chair Roland Hernandez.Riley, however, found no proof that the board knew or must have known about the bribery, no matter how pervasive it might have been, and even though Hernandez was ""only a degree or two"" removed from key directors.Applying Delaware law because Wal-Mart is incorporated in that state, Riley said the case ""boils down to the same logic Delaware courts have consistently rejected, namely the inference that directors must have known about a problem because someone was supposed to tell them about it."" Wal-Mart spokesman Randy Hargrove said: ""We are pleased with the decision.

883,"  Wal-Mart Stores Inc is in talks to buy Jet.com, a year-old online rival, as part of a multibillion-dollar revamp of its e-commerce division aimed at boosting online sales growth, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.Jet.com could be worth as much as $3 billion, the Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter. Wal-Mart spokesman Greg Hitt declined to comment and Jet could not be immediately reached for comment.The world's largest retailer is playing catch up with Amazon.com Inc on distribution and technology. The acquisition could give it access to Jet.com's innovative pricing software, its network of warehouses and customer data.For the past five years Wal-Mart has been on an acquisition spree, buying 15 startups in an attempt to bring in the talent and technology needed to drive e-commerce growth. That includes a social data analysis startup that became its core Silicon Valley technology arm, @WalmartLabs.While Wal-Mart has not said what it spent on those acquisitions, it has disclosed a total of $3.1 billion for e-commerce and digital projects, such as its platform and new warehouses, in the four fiscal years to January 2017. Wal-Mart acquired a majority stake in Chinese e-commerce firm Yihaodian in 2012 but sold it in June to JD.com Inc, which is China's second-largest e-commerce company.Despite its investments, Wal-Mart has not projected when its online business might turn a profit and its goal of growing by 20 to 30 percent a year may be tough to achieve.Wal-Mart's online business has struggled and posted its slowest growth in a year in the latest quarter. Its online sales were $13.7 billion in 2015, according to research firm Internet Retailer. Wal-Mart said recently that all the changes brought on by the e-commerce reboot, including installing a new technology platform and building new warehouses, contributed to its recent slowdown in growth.A July 2015 survey by consulting firm Kantar Retail showed the extent to which Amazon had eaten into Wal-Mart's customer base. The survey found that 48 percent of shoppers at Wal-Mart Supercenters were placing orders weekly or monthly on Amazon.com, double the percentage shopping at that frequency on Wal-Mart's own site. Acquiring Jet could help Wal-Mart in establishing a bigger presence online, analysts said. The startup was launched in July 2015 and has raised more than $500 million in capital from venture capital firms.    Jet's initial strategy was to offer large up-front discounts and the lowest prices on items based on a unique pricing formula that took into account factors like basket size, for an annual $50 fee. But three months after launch, Jet changed strategy and eliminated its subscription model.Wal-Mart shares closed 0.3 percent lower at $72.94 on the New York Stock Exchange.

888,"   By Nandita Bose  Wal-Mart Stores Inc, vying to better challenge Amazon.com Inc , will pay about $3 billion for internet retailer Jet.com and its innovative pricing software in the largest-ever deal for an e-commerce startup.The deal disclosed on Monday follows a five-year e-commerce acquisition spree in which Wal-Mart, the world's biggest traditional retailer, has already bought 15 startups, seeking the talent and technology to make it a dominant player online and narrow the massive gap with market leader Amazon.Wal-Mart's online division has underperformed against Amazon, posting its slowest growth in a year in the first quarter as it struggled to gain traction with consumers, especially millennials.Jet.com was launched by internet entrepreneur Marc Lore in July 2015 and includes software that can offer a customer lower prices as they add items to their shopping cart. Wal-Mart has said it would integrate that software into its main website  while keeping Jet.com as a separate entity.""One of the things we really like (about Jet) is that the customer is even more in-charge of the price that they pay,"" Chief Executive Doug McMillon said on a media call.McMillon said Wal-Mart will take time in getting the technology and design components from Jet and that they will grow both brands separately in the short-term.""Over time, piece-by-piece, we will end up running a business that is simpler and not completely independent.""McMillon said Lore would run its new U.S. e-commerce business. Lore had cofounded Quidsi, the owner of sites like Diapers.com and Soap.com, which was sold to Amazon. ""Marc's e-commerce experience and success are obviously attractive,"" McMillon said.Wal-Mart's current head of global e-commerce Neil Ashe will leave the company at the end of the fiscal year.The decision to run Jet as an independent website is a good step because it can stay focused on growth, but the price Wal-Mart paid is high, UBS retail analyst Michael Lasser said in a note to clients.Wal-Mart said it would pay around $3 billion in cash and $300 million in shares for Jet, with some of that paid over time. Given Jet's revenue of about $500 million, the cash purchase price represents six times Jet's revenue, according to analysts. Moody's retail analyst Charlie O'Shea said the acquisition gives Wal-Mart a leg-up on competitors in the race to be the No. 2 online retailer, citing the size of Jet.com's online offerings and number of customers. Wal-Mart said Jet has added nearly 400,000 new shoppers monthly.""The impact on Amazon will be fairly benign. However, this acquisition, in tandem with its joint-venture in China with JD.com, demonstrates that Walmart is attacking online retail with significant zeal,"" he said.In June, Wal-Mart said it sold its Chinese online grocery store in return for a stake in JD.com Inc, China's 2 e-commerce firm.  BILLIONS SPENT ON ONLINE EFFORTS Wal-Mart's first-quarter online sales grew 7 percent, a weaker rate than any of the four quarters just before that. In 2015, Wal-Mart's online sales rose 12.3 percent to $13.7 billion, compared with a 16 percent jump to $92.4 billion for Amazon.com.Wal-Mart has not said what it spent on acquisitions, but prior to the Jet.com deal it disclosed a total of $3.1 billion for e-commerce and digital projects, such as its platform and new warehouses, in the four fiscal years to January 2017.The deal should give Wal-Mart the scale to bolster its online presence, broaden its assortment of goods and offer the lowest prices at the same time, analysts said.Wal-Mart noted Jet has offered 12 million items in its first year of operation. Wal-Mart has said previously it wants to expand its online selection from around 10 million items to the tens of millions over the next few years. Rival Amazon has more than 200 million items for sale online.

""Marc's e-commerce experience and success are obviously attractive,"" McMillon said.Wal-Mart's current head of global e-commerce Neil Ashe will leave the company at the end of the fiscal year.The decision to run Jet as an independent website is a good step because it can stay focused on growth, but the price Wal-Mart paid is high, UBS retail analyst Michael Lasser said in a note to clients.Wal-Mart said it would pay around $3 billion in cash and $300 million in shares for Jet, with some of that paid over time. Given Jet's revenue of about $500 million, the cash purchase price represents six times Jet's revenue, according to analysts. Moody's retail analyst Charlie O'Shea said the acquisition gives Wal-Mart a leg-up on competitors in the race to be the No. 2 online retailer, citing the size of Jet.com's online offerings and number of customers. Wal-Mart said Jet has added nearly 400,000 new shoppers monthly.""The impact on Amazon will be fairly benign. However, this acquisition, in tandem with its joint-venture in China with JD.com, demonstrates that Walmart is attacking online retail with significant zeal,"" he said.In June, Wal-Mart said it sold its Chinese online grocery store in return for a stake in JD.com Inc, China's 2 e-commerce firm.  BILLIONS SPENT ON ONLINE EFFORTS Wal-Mart's first-quarter online sales grew 7 percent, a weaker rate than any of the four quarters just before that. In 2015, Wal-Mart's online sales rose 12.3 percent to $13.7 billion, compared with a 16 percent jump to $92.4 billion for Amazon.com.Wal-Mart has not said what it spent on acquisitions, but prior to the Jet.com deal it disclosed a total of $3.1 billion for e-commerce and digital projects, such as its platform and new warehouses, in the four fiscal years to January 2017.The deal should give Wal-Mart the scale to bolster its online presence, broaden its assortment of goods and offer the lowest prices at the same time, analysts said.Wal-Mart noted Jet has offered 12 million items in its first year of operation. Wal-Mart has said previously it wants to expand its online selection from around 10 million items to the tens of millions over the next few years. Rival Amazon has more than 200 million items for sale online.

Walmex will also receive an additional 3.3 billion pesos in items including declared dividends after the deal closes, it said in a statement.In January, the retailer said it was looking to sell Suburbia without giving a timeframe for completing the sale. Some Mexican media outlets had speculated the sale could fetch as much as $2 billion.Liverpool is one of Mexico's department store operators, with more than 100 outlets. Company representatives were not immediately available for comment.Wal-Mart has been looking to double sales in Mexico by 2024 by boosting its core business of running discount retail and membership stores, and expanding its fresh food business. The divestiture is part of Wal-Mart's strategy, announced in 2013, to streamline and sell businesses not central to its overseas operations. Wal-Mart's international division, which contributes roughly one-third of the company's total annual sales of nearly $480 billion, has divested some non-core businesses across Chile, Mexico and Canada in the past two years. In Mexico over the past three years, Walmex has sold its Vips restaurant chain to fast-food operator Alsea SAB (ALSEA.MX) for $626 million, and its Banco Walmart unit to Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim's bank Grupo Financiero Inbursa (GFINBURO.MX) for about $247 million.  Wal-Mart acquired Suburbia's parent supermarket chain Cifra in 1997. Suburbia has 119 stores in 46 cities and is popular with urban shoppers, ranking among Mexico's top five department stores, according to analysts.Suburbia, which is profitable, contributed 3 percent to Walmex's overall revenue in 2015. Walmex, Mexico's biggest private sector employer and the country's largest retailer, posted sales of about $26.35 billion in 2015.At the company's shareholder's meeting in June, David Cheesewright, head of Wal-Mart's overseas division, singled out the Mexican market as a top priority. Mexico has Wal-Mart's largest number of stores outside the United States.

The U.S. dollar was near an eight-week low against major currencies in the wake of minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting published on Wednesday showing policymakers were unlikely to raise interest rates soon.Key indexes on Wall Street edged up, aided by gains in the energy sector and by big-box retailer Wal-Mart that offset losses in the telecom sector.

Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will meet on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum in Algeria on Sept. 26-28. Brent last traded at $50.82 a barrel, up nearly 2 percent on the day. U.S. light crude oil CLc1 was up about 3 percent at $48.23.Oil prices were also helped by a falling dollar .DXY, which slipped to its lowest against a basket of major currencies since June 24 as traders marked down the odds of an interest rate increase by the Fed.""When we did not receive the unambiguous hawkishness from the FOMC minutes, that kind of opened up the door to additional (dollar) selling,"" said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York Oil is priced in dollars, so it becomes more valuable as the dollar's value falls.U.S. Treasury yields slipped as fixed-income investors were also doubtful of the likelihood that the Fed would tighten monetary policy soon, despite Dudley's comments and another drop in jobless claims.Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR rose 8/32 in price for a yield of 1.531 percent. The pan-European STOXX 600 index , which had fallen in the last four sessions on a run of weak company earnings, was up 0.72 percent.MSCI's All World index .MIWD00000PUS climbed 0.4 percent to head back toward a one-year high, lifted by a 0.47 percent rise in Asian shares, their biggest gain since Aug. 8. .MIAPJ0000PUSEmerging market shares also had sizeable gains, with MSCI's emerging markets index .MSCIEF up 0.68 percent.Japan's Nikkei .N225, however, bucked the trend, dropping 1.5 percent after data showed exports from the country falling at their fastest pace since the financial crisis.

Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will meet on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum, which groups producers and consumers, in Algeria on Sept. 26-28. However, analysts were doubtful on the prospects of an agreement.""We remain skeptical that renewed talks of a production freeze by OPEC and other large producers will lead to a deal. Prices are only marginally above where they were when the group met in Doha in April and couldn't agree to a deal,"" ANZ analysts said in a note.Oil prices were also helped by the falling dollar, which slipped to its lowest against a basket of major currencies since June 24 as traders marked down the odds of an interest rate increase by the Fed.The minutes from July's Federal Open Market Committee, released on Wednesday, showed members of the rate-setting group were generally upbeat about the U.S. economic outlook but showed a bias against raising interest rates soon. ""The market's take on the FOMC minutes is to read them in a somewhat more dovish fashion on the view that the Fed seems too divided to raise rates anytime soon,"" said Alan Ruskin, global head of FX strategy at Deutsche Bank in New York.Oil is priced in dollars, so oil becomes more valuable as the dollar's value falls.U.S. Treasury prices were little changed after Dudley's comments and the jobless claims data.Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes were flat in price for a yield of 1.562 percent.The pan-European STOXX 600 index, which had fallen in the last four sessions on a run of weak company earnings, was up 0.5 percent.MSCI's All World index climbed 0.2 percent to head back toward a one-year high, pushed higher by a 0.5 percent rise in Asian shares, their biggest since Aug. 8.Japan's Nikkei bucked the trend though, dropping 1.5 percent after data showed exports from the country falling at their fastest pace since the financial crisis.

The retailer employs about 1.5 million people in the United States.Barnett said the move is part of Wal-Mart's efforts to have more employees on the sales floor, and the retailer is offering affected workers consumer-facing positions in stores. In June, Wal-Mart, the country's largest private-sector employer, had said it would cut back-office jobs in hundreds of stores and if it was satisfied with the changes it would roll it out to other stores. Recently, the retailer launched a new system for scheduling workers at 650 U.S. stores in an effort to improve staffing levels during peak shopping times.Wal-Mart has also committed to investing $2.7 billion in programs that involve training its workforce and a series of wage hikes that took the minimum hourly pay for store workers to $10 an hour earlier this year.     The Wall Street Journal first reported the number of job cuts on Thursday. The eliminated back-office jobs typically include higher paid hourly workers who manage tasks like an individual store's daily cash flow or process claims from manufacturers delivering goods directly to stores. Starting early next year, those jobs will be automated and handled by a central office, the retailer had said in June.

920,"  Wal-Mart Stores Inc's (WMT.N) Canadian unit will stop accepting Visa Inc (V.N) cards at 16 stores in the province of Manitoba starting Oct. 24, a company spokesman said on Wednesday, raising the stakes in a high-profile fee dispute in the country.Manitoba was ""most ready"" for the move on Visa cards, Wal-Mart spokesman Alex Roberton said, without giving any details on why the province was chosen.Wal-Mart Canada stopped accepting Visa cards in three Thunder Bay, Ontario stores in July and said the step would be mirrored across the country.The retailer, which has over 400 stores in Canada, added that the decision will not affect Wal-Mart stores outside the country. In a rare example of talks between a major retailer and credit card company spilling out in public, Wal-Mart said in June it had been unable to agree with Visa on an ""acceptable fee"" and would no longer accept the company's credit cards unless it got a better deal.Visa cards may be banned in more stores if the companies cannot reach an agreement, Wal-Mart spokesman Roberton said, though he did not specify which ones. ""We're committed to continuing negotiations with Visa, and we are still hopeful of reaching an agreement‎.""Visa spokeswoman Connie Kim said Walmart's decision to limit Visa acceptance in Manitoba was ""disappointing.""

921,"   By James Davey | LONDON  LONDON Morrisons (MRW.L), Britain's No.4 supermarket group, reported better than expected results on Thursday as shoppers returned to its stores, suggesting a recovery under new management is gaining momentum and sending its shares sharply higher.The Bradford, northern England-based group reported a rise in first-half profit for the first time in four years and a third straight quarter of underlying sales growth. It also raised forecasts for cost savings, cash flow and debt reduction.Its shares rose by up to 9 percent, while those of bigger rivals, market leader Tesco (TSCO.L) and Sainsbury's (SBRY.L) increased by up to 4 percent and 3 percent respectively on renewed hopes Britain's traditional big supermarkets could fight back successfully against German discounters Aldi and Lidl.Paul Mumford, fund manager at Cavendish, noted Morrisons was currently the second most ""shorted"" UK stock. Some 18 percent of its shares are out on loan with investors betting they will fall, with levels for Tesco and Sainsbury's not far behind.""Should these positions be forced into reverse, prices will buoy (further),"" he said.Former Tesco executive David Potts joined Morrisons as CEO in March 2015 with a remit to revive the group after it was hurt by the rapid rise of the discounters in its northern heartlands.""We’re very much still in the foothills of our recovery programme,"" he told reporters. ""But so far, so good."" Potts has reversed Morrisons' loss of customers by cutting prices, improving product quality and availability and bolstering store standards and customer service.""When we get it right customers come back,"" he said, pointing to a 4 percent rise in the second quarter year-on-year.Potts has also overhauled Morrisons' online strategy through a renegotiated distribution agreement with Ocado (OCDO.L) and a wholesale supply deal with Amazon (AMZN.O). FIGHTING BACK In the 26 weeks to July 31, Morrisons' underlying pretax profit rose 11 percent to 157 million pounds ($208 million), beating analysts' average forecast of 150 million pounds.Sales at stores open over a year were up 2 percent in the second quarter versus a 0.7 percent rise in the first.  Potts said Morrisons’ supermarkets, stripping out online sales, saw a rise in like-for-like sales in the second quarter for the first time since 2011-12. Net debt was reduced by 477 million pounds to 1.27 billion pounds, below a target of 1.4-1.5 billion for the end of the fiscal year. That target has now been cut to 1.2 billion, with debt expected to be less than 1 billion by the end of 2017-18.Morrisons also said it would beat its cost savings target of 1 billion pounds this fiscal year and hit its goal of 2 billion of free cash flow six months early. It lifted a working capital improvement target by 200 million pounds to 1 billion pounds. The interim dividend was up 5.3 percent to 1.58 pence a share.Echoing other UK retailers, Potts said consumer behavior had not been impacted by Britain's vote to leave the European Union. However, he added the fall in sterling since the vote could lead to an easing of deflation in the industry as the cost of importing food is driven higher.

922,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, September 16 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.'s  (Walmart) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'AA' and Short-term IDR and  commercial paper ratings at 'F1+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. See the full  list of ratings at the end of this press release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Significant Scale, Defensible Market Position: Walmart's ratings reflect the operational and financial flexibility and strong  free cash flow profile that results from its substantial scale ($482 billion in  2015 sales) and dominant market position in North America. Despite its large  size and increased competition from alternative discount formats, including  online-only players, the company's ability to invest in its business while  exercising price leadership has led to Walmart maintaining market share in  nearly all categories in recent years.  The ratings consider Walmart's current investments in wages, e-commerce, and  other initiatives, which have resulted in near-term EBITDA margin contraction.  Despite the pressure on operating results, Fitch believes the company is making  appropriate decisions to drive long-term sales growth while using its  significant power vis a vis suppliers and other counterparties to support  near-term cash flow with working capital improvements. Positive U.S. Comps, Mixed Global Trends:  Walmart U.S., which represented 62% of revenue and 73% of operating profit in  2015, has reported eight consecutive quarters of positive comps, driven by seven  straight quarters of traffic growth. Growth is being supported by investments in  price and improved in-store execution and has been fairly broad-based across  categories although grocery has exhibited volatility due to food deflation,  which has had a 50 - 100 basis point (bp) impact in recent quarters.  Fitch expects U.S comps of 1% - 2% in 2016 and 2017 as positive store traffic  and a modest but increasing contribution from e-commerce offsets the impact of  deflation and price investments. Comp growth above 2% is not viewed as likely,  given Walmart's size and that Walmart's U.S. comp growth has averaged about 1%  since 2008.  Walmart International, which represented 26% of revenue and 20% of operating  profit in 2015, has reported mixed comps across its key markets.  Mexico is the  segment's best-performing market, as comps rose 7.3% in the latest quarter.  Conversely, the UK is the worst-performing, as comps declined 7.5% in the latest  quarter, despite price investments. Fitch expects challenges in the UK may  persist into 2017 due to heightened competition and a forecasted slowdown in GDP  growth in 2017, but potentially a more robust economy in Mexico next year should  support continued strong results in that region.   Sam's Club, which represented 12% of revenue and 7% of operating profit in 2015,  has made a flat to negative contribution to Walmart's revenue since 2014 due to  lower fuel sales. Excluding fuel, comps at Sam's Club have been consistently  positive, despite slightly lower traffic, while membership income is growing at  a low-single-digit rate.  Integrating Physical and Digital to Drive Revenue:  Walmart is improving the in-store experience while deepening its digital  relationship with customers in light of the increasingly competitive landscape  and shifting consumer buying habits. Cleaner and more organized stores, better  customer service, and a focus on fresh food offerings are examples of ways  Walmart is improving the in-store experience. Meanwhile, increased on-line  offerings, new distribution centers, and a $49/year unlimited 2-day shipping  pass are examples of how the company is strengthening its competiveness in  e-commerce.  Fitch expects the pending acquisition of Jet.com to equip Walmart with enhanced  technology and increased expertise to further strengthen Walmart.com and to  expand Walmart's appeal to younger and urban consumers. Sales from physical  stores will continue to represent the bulk of Walmart's revenue and the  contribution from e-commerce is expected to increase only modestly, given  Fitch's view that consumer shift towards on-line grocery will be more gradual  than that of other categories. Margins Reset, Stabilization Anticipated:  Fitch views the recent step-down in margins and EBITDA as a reset in Walmart's  profitability but is balancing that against the company's improved cash flow  generation. Walmart's operating margin declined from 5.6% in 2014 to 5.2% in  2015, due mainly to the impact of increased wages, benefits, and training for  U.S. employees.  Fitch expects Walmart's operating margin to decline another  50bps to 4.7% in 2016 due to the second leg of these investments. As a result,  EBITDA could decline from a peak of $36 billion in 2014 to the $33 billion range  in 2016 - 2017 before resuming modest growth in 2018.  Operating margin is expected to stabilize in the mid-to-high 4% range, absent  additional large increases in wages.  Over time, we expect gross margin to  decline modestly as Walmart invests in price, offset by leverage on SG&A  expenses.  Strong Cash Flow, Stable Leverage:  Walmart's considerable cash from operations (CFO), which has averaged over $26  billion annually since 2012, provides the company the financial flexibility to  invest in its business and return cash to shareholders while maintaining  relatively stable leverage.  Fitch anticipates that free cash flow (FCF; after dividends) will approximate $7  billion annually in 2016 and 2017, excluding any benefit from working capital  improvement.  This is despite a projected 7% decline in operating income in 2016  and flat operating income in 2017.  Improvements in working capital could add  another $1.5 billion to $2 billion to FCF in 2016 and 2017. Fitch expects adjusted leverage (debt plus capitalized leases/EBITDAR) to remain  stable at around 2x, as the current pace of share repurchases and investments  such as Jet.com can be largely funded with internally generated cash. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Walmart include: --Revenue growth of about 1% in 2016, and low to mid 2% range in 2017/2018,  reflecting gradually improving comps and about 1% square footage growth beyond  2016; -- Operating income declines 7% in 2016, is flat in 2017, and grows 3% in 2018; --Operating margin approximates 4.7% in 2016 and stabilizes in the mid-4x range  thereafter; --EBITDA margin approximates 6.8% in 2016 and stabilizes near this range  thereafter; --FCF after dividends of approximately $7 billion annually in 2016 and 2017,  excluding working capital benefit, and reflecting stable capex of roughly $11  billion and a projected 2% increase in dividends/share.  FCF could be $1.5 -$2  billion higher on working capital improvements;  --Adjusted leverage of approximately 2x through the forecast period. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive Rating Action: An upgrade is unlikely, given the rating is currently at  the high end of the rating spectrum and fully captures the company's financial  and qualitative strengths. Negative Rating Action: Future developments that may, individually or  collectively, lead to negative rating action include a weakening comp  trajectory, due to negative store traffic and in the absence of an acceleration  in e-commerce contribution. Adjusted leverage sustained above 2x as a result of  meaningful margin contraction beyond 2016, led by investments in business that  do not result in top line growth or due to debt-financed share buybacks would  also be rating concerns. LIQUIDITY Walmart had nearly $18 billion of liquidity inclusive of revolver availability  and readily available cash which excludes $700 million of oversees cash that may  not be easily transferable, as of July 31, 2016. Liquidity is supported by the  firm's meaningful FCF and good access to both bank and capital markets. Readily  available cash is defined as reported cash, which totaled $7.7 billion at July  31, 2016, less $0.7 billion of cash that may not be fully transferable to the  U.S. and operational cash of $650 million. Walmart has an undrawn $7.5 billion  364-day revolver expiring in June 2017 and an undrawn $5 billion revolver  expiring in June 2021, which back up its $20 billion commercial paper (CP)  program.  FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the following: Wal-mart Stores, Inc. --Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'AA';  --Senior unsecured debt at 'AA'; --Bank credit facility at 'AA'; --Short-Term IDR at 'F1+'; --Commercial paper at 'F1+'.  The Rating Outlook is Stable.

923,"   By Nandita Bose | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) on Monday said it has completed the acquisition of internet retailer Jet.com after agreeing to pay about $3 billion for the e-commerce startup last month.Wal-Mart Chief Executive Doug McMillon announced the closing of the deal, which was pending regulatory approval, in a blog post on the retailer's website.The acquisition will impact Wal-Mart's 2017 fiscal year earnings marginally more than the retailer's initial estimate of a 5 cents per share impact as the transaction closed ahead of time, Wal-Mart said. The deal, which was the largest for an online startup, will give Wal-Mart access to Jet.com's innovative pricing software and will help the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer to better compete with online rival Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). ""A lot of folks ask me 'Why Jet.com?,"" McMillon said in a blog post. The answer he said was in the savings both Wal-Mart and Jet can together offer shoppers.Jet, with its ability to lower prices as customers add more items to their shopping carts, will help the world's largest retailer reach more customers such as millennial shoppers. The deal would also strengthen Wal-Mart's existing e-commerce infrastructure, McMillon said. Wal-Mart has built its website into the second largest online retailer by traffic in the U.S. in the past six months, the blog post said. It has also expanded the assortment of products on its website from 7 million to 15 million items and is adding a million more each month. Jet's founder Marc Lore will join Wal-Mart as the President and Chief Executive of Wal-Mart's U.S. ecommerce business and will report to McMillon, the company said in a separate statement.""I'll be spending a lot of time with the team in the coming weeks and months focused on scaling Walmart.com and Jet.com,"" Lore said. Over a five-year period Lore will receive stock units that involve the issuance of 3.55 million shares of Wal-Mart's common stock valued at 10 cents per share, the statement said. This is a part of the $300 million of Wal-Mart shares that would be paid over time as part of the original transaction.The Jet deal follows a five-year e-commerce acquisition spree in which Wal-Mart has bought 15 startups, seeking the talent and technology to make it a dominant player online and narrow the gap with Amazon.

This was a jump from 880,000 employees in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and 687,000 workers in fiscal 2015.On a per-employee basis, the average bonus comes to about $220. Quarterly bonuses can account for up to 5 percent of a Wal-Mart store employee's total annual income, the retailer said.Wal-Mart is the largest private employer in the United States. Its 1.5 million workers include store staff, store management and truck drivers. Hourly employees at the company's nearly 4,600 U.S. locations are eligible for quarterly bonuses based on the performance of their store. This increase in bonuses comes after the retailer bucked a string of weak earnings by its rivals and reported a better-than-expected quarterly performance last month. Wal-Mart said  it benefited from more efficient U.S. stores and higher employee wages that fostered better customer service.At the same time the retailer is cutting back-office jobs, announcing earlier this month the elimination of about 7,000 positions, mostly in accounting and invoicing at its U.S. stores. It will offer these affected employees consumer-facing positions. Wal-Mart spokesman Kory Lundberg said until two years ago Wal-Mart's internal targets focused more on metrics like higher store sales. However, in the past two years the retailer has pivoted towards a greater emphasis on customer service by bringing more employees to the front of the store from its back rooms.Entry-level wages have also been increased to $10 an hour and $2.7 billion will be invested in employee compensation and training over two years, a move Wal-Mart says has contributed to improved service levels.

935,"  MUMBAI/HONG KONG Wal-Mart Stores Inc is in talks to buy a minority stake in India's largest e-commerce firm Flipkart, two people familiar with the matter said, as the world's biggest retailer aims to break into a fast growing but highly competitive online retail market.One of the sources said the U.S. retailer was looking to invest between $750 million and $1 billion in Flipkart, but the final value and size of the stake would depend on the outcome of talks about the Indian company's overall valuation.A deal would pit Wal-Mart against U.S. rival Amazon.com Inc, which has been expanding rapidly in a market that Bank of America Merrill Lynch has forecast will surge to $220 billion in value of goods sold by 2025 from about $11 billion last year. Wal-Mart operates 21 wholesale stores in the South Asian country, but is discouraged from setting up its own bricks-and-mortar shops by rules that limit foreign ownership for multi-brand retailers to 51 percent and the cost of setting up shops in a country as large as India.For Flipkart, a cash infusion from Wal-Mart would come in handy at a time when funding from traditional investors into the online space such as venture capital is proving harder to obtain amid worries about valuations in India.Kashyap Chanchani, managing partner of the Rainmaker Group, a Mumbai-based tech and digital media investment banking firm, said it was natural for Wal-Mart to want to partner with Flipkart.""India does not lend itself to big box retail since rentals are very very expensive,"" he said. If a deal is agreed, Wal-Mart would join other foreign strategic investors in India's online players. China's Alibaba Group Holding, Japan's SoftBank Group Corp and Taiwan's Foxconn last year led an investment of $500 million in Flipkart's smaller rival Snapdeal.Alibaba is also the biggest shareholder in India's One97 Communications, which operates payments services and an e-commerce market place under the PayTM trade name. The sources declined to be identified because the talks are preliminary and have not been made public. Wal-Mart in India and Flipkart declined to comment.CUT-THROAT COMPETITION Launched in 2007 by two former Amazon employees, Flipkart sells everything from cellphones to suitcases and cosmetics. Its current investors include Tiger Global Management and Accel Partners. A Wal-Mart bet on Flipkart would come at a time when Amazon is planning an aggressive expansion into India. Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of the online retailer, said in June it would invest an additional $3 billion in India after investing $2 billion already, and has recently rolled out its Prime membership service in the country.Bank of America estimated Amazon could increase its market share to 37 percent by 2019 from 31 percent now, approaching the 44 percent held currently by Flipkart.But concerns about profits continue to weigh on the sector, as severe competition is forcing the online retailers to resort to heavy discounts while they also need to invest in infrastructure such as warehouse centers. Indian brokerage Kotak estimated Flipkart, Amazon and Snapdeal lost a combined 50 billion rupees  ($751.46 million) in the year ended in March 2015. The online retailers do not disclose financial data but analysts say losses likely have increased since then. Flipkart has been valued at about $11.5 billion, local media reported last month, citing a U.S. regulatory filing from investor Valic, a division of American International Group Inc, down from as much as $15 billion earlier this year. Wal-Mart agreed in June to take a 5 percent stake in China's JD.com Inc, giving the U.S. firm a ringside seat in JD.com's bitter rivalry with Alibaba Group.

939,"   By Nandita Bose | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) said it plans to focus heavily on its e-commerce operations on Thursday and warned investors that the cost of the long-term plan would weigh on earnings over the next two years.The strategy by the world's biggest bricks-and-mortar retailer, which includes slowing the pace of new store openings, is centered on cracking the dominance of Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) in online retailing and face off against other rivals like Target (TGT.N).Wal-Mart's shares were down 2.9 percent in afternoon trading at $69.59.""This company over time will look like an e-commerce company,"" Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon told investors gathered at Wal-Mart's headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas.Wal-Mart's plan includes doubling the number of its large warehouses focused on e-commerce sales to 10 in 2016, Reuters reported. It now has the ability to ship to most of the United States in one day. The company spent more than $3 billion in August to buy e-commerce startup Jet.com, which attracts millennial shoppers, and could help boost sales.  Wal-Mart is looking for online sales growth of 20 percent to 30 percent in the second half of this year, excluding the recent sale of Chinese website Yihaodian, and for even faster growth in the next few years.Online sales currently account for about 3 percent of total sales. Wal-Mart reined in its profit expectations as a result of its investments in e-commerce, now forecasting flat earnings for the fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 2018, down from a previous forecast of profit growth. It estimated capital expenses at about $11 billion, similar to this year.Fiscal 2019 earnings-per-share growth is now likely to be at the low end of its previous forecast of 5 percent to 10 percent.While the investments in online growth will be a challenge to margins, they are ""essential for future-proofing the business for the long run"", Cowen & Co analysts said in a research note. The company has accelerated investments in e-commerce and digital from about $300 million in 2013 to $1.1 billion this year for a total of about $3 billion, excluding acquisitions, according to public filings and earnings reports.Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said only about 20 percent of capital spending would go to store openings. Now the company plans to increase revenue from existing stores and its online business instead of new locations, which generated the bulk of growth in the past four years, he added.In fiscal 2018, Wal-Mart plans to build 35 supercenters compared to 69 last year. It will only open 20 neighborhood markets from 161 last year.

942,"   By Nandita Bose | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) is accelerating its investment in e-commerce in a bid to narrow the gap with Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and to give it an even more dominant position against the rest of the field in retail. The world's largest retailer is now on track to double the number of giant warehouses dedicated to online sales to 10 by the end of 2016, according to Justen Traweek, vice-president of e-commerce supply chain and fulfillment.That pace is faster than the 8 large warehouses that industry consultants expected Wal-Mart to build by the end of 2017.At the same time, Wal-Mart in the last year has installed new technology such as automated product sorting and improved item tracking that for the first time puts them on par with Amazon's robot-staffed facilities, according to supply-chain consultants.""We have doubled our capacity in the last twelve months and that allows us to ship to a majority of the U.S. population in one day,"" Traweek said.Wal-Mart is holding its annual investor day on Thursday when, among other topics, it is expected to update on the progress it has made in its e-commerce business. Wal-Mart, which has about 4,600 stores in the United States and over 6,000 worldwide, has been investing in e-commerce for 15 years, but it still lags far behind Amazon.     ""These additions definitely give Wal-Mart the opportunity to compete better than other companies going head-to-head with Amazon,"" said Steve Osburn, director of supply chain with consultancy Kurt Salmon, referring to the likes of Target (TGT.N) and others. ""Having said that, choosing to race with Amazon is different than catching up with them.""Wal-Mart in the last four fiscal years has accelerated its investment in e-commerce and digital initiatives, excluding acquisitions, from about $300 million in 2013 to $1.1 billion this year for a total of about $3 billion, according to public filings and earnings transcripts. E-commerce accounts for about 3 percent of Wal-Mart's overall sales.  Since 2011, Wal-Mart has acquired 15 e-commerce startups, one of which became its core Silicon Valley technology arm, @WalmartLabs. Last month, it completed its purchase of online retailer Jet.com for about $3 billion and named Jet's founder, Marc Lore, the head of Wal-Mart's e-commerce business. The massive warehouses are key to Wal-Mart's e-commerce strategy because they enable the company to deliver packages more economically when shipping online orders with multiple items. Fulfilling such orders now can often mean multiple shipments from different warehouses or stores.""This improves two fundamental things: Wal-Mart's speed to market, which is how fast their products reach consumers, and it will help them reach an even larger audience,"" said Regenia Sanders, vice-president of supply chain at consultancy SSA & Co.     Even with Wal-Mart's new investments, though, Amazon has a commanding position in e-commerce with 40 warehouses of one million-plus square feet and plans to open five more by the first quarter of next year, according to data compiled for Reuters by retail technology firm ChannelAdvisor.Its online sales of $107 billion last year far outstrip Wal-Mart's $13.7 billion of online sales in the same period. The ten warehouses are designed to boost its overall distribution capabilities, which consists of smaller online warehouses, stores that stock online orders and 160 store serving distribution centers that stock online items. Amazon runs 104 warehouses and has announced 18 new ones, according to ChannelAdvisor data. An Amazon spokeswoman did not comment on specific questions for this story, but did say the company is laser focused on its customers and delivering unlimited, fast, free Prime Shipping.TRYING TO NARROW THE GAP   Inside Wal-Mart's 1.2 million square-foot warehouse in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, two 40-foot robotic towers shuttle products like Cheerio's from storage to packaging. It handles more than 70 percent of the orders for best-selling products, Traweek said.Workers inside wear smart-phone like devices on their wrists that tell them where to find a product, what box it needs to got into and even how much tape is required to seal the package.    The devices give Wal-Mart the ability to store items anywhere in the warehouse and increase efficiency and lower costs, Traweek said, though he would not detail cost savings.     The new warehouses allow Wal-Mart to now ship orders to 70 percent of Americans in a day, Traweek said, but it cannot yet do so profitably. That's why it has not yet begun to promise one-day delivery to customers, he said. Charles Sizemore, founder of Sizemore Capital Management LLC which owns Wal-Mart shares, said investors expect profitable growth from Wal-Mart, while Amazon is still given leeway to lose money in the hunt for longer-term growth.    ""Anything that crimps Wal-Mart's profits in the short term will not be met well by their shareholders, so trying to find a cost-effective shipping solution is a sensible approach,"" he said.Wal-Mart plans to complete at least one more giant warehouse, in addition to the ten, by the first quarter of 2017, Traweek said. The retailer had worked with five giant warehouses since launching its online business in 2000.

Fulfilling such orders now can often mean multiple shipments from different warehouses or stores.""This improves two fundamental things: Wal-Mart's speed to market, which is how fast their products reach consumers, and it will help them reach an even larger audience,"" said Regenia Sanders, vice-president of supply chain at consultancy SSA & Co.Even with Wal-Mart's new investments, though, Amazon has a commanding position in e-commerce with 40 warehouses of one million-plus square feet and plans to open five more by the first quarter of next year, according to data compiled for Reuters by retail technology firm ChannelAdvisor. Its online sales of $107 billion last year far outstrip Wal-Mart's $13.7 billion of online sales in the same period.The ten warehouses are designed to boost its overall distribution capabilities, which consists of smaller online warehouses, stores that stock online orders and 160 store serving distribution centers that stock online items. Amazon runs 104 warehouses and has announced 18 new ones, according to ChannelAdvisor data.An Amazon spokeswoman did not comment on specific questions for this story, but did say the company is laser focused on its customers and delivering unlimited, fast, free Prime Shipping. TRYING TO NARROW THE GAP Inside Wal-Mart's 1.2 million square-foot warehouse in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, two 40-foot robotic towers shuttle products like Cheerio's from storage to packaging. It handles more than 70 percent of the orders for best-selling products, Traweek said.Workers inside wear smart-phone like devices on their wrists that tell them where to find a product, what box it needs to got into and even how much tape is required to seal the package.The devices give Wal-Mart the ability to store items anywhere in the warehouse and increase efficiency and lower costs, Traweek said, though he would not detail cost savings.The new warehouses allow Wal-Mart to now ship orders to 70 percent of Americans in a day, Traweek said, but it cannot yet do so profitably. That's why it has not yet begun to promise one-day delivery to customers, he said.Charles Sizemore, founder of Sizemore Capital Management LLC which owns Wal-Mart shares, said investors expect profitable growth from Wal-Mart, while Amazon is still given leeway to lose money in the hunt for longer-term growth.""Anything that crimps Wal-Mart's profits in the short term will not be met well by their shareholders, so trying to find a cost-effective shipping solution is a sensible approach,"" he said.Wal-Mart plans to complete at least one more giant warehouse, in addition to the ten, by the first quarter of 2017, Traweek said.

949,"   By Daniel Wiessner and Nandita Bose  Wal-Mart Stores Inc has raised salaries for entry-level managers before a rule change that extends mandatory overtime pay to more than 4 million U.S. workers, in an attempt to shield itself from unpredictable additional costs for salaried employees.Wal-Mart raised salaries from $45,000 to $48,500 annually for employees including store management, spokesman Randy Hargrove said on Tuesday. The retailer did not break out the number of employees who received the raise.The new Obama administration rule, set to take effect Dec. 1, will require employers to pay overtime to salaried workers earning less than $47,500 a year, double the current threshold of $23,660.""We think the starting rate of $48,500 a year ... would make a lot of business sense for our company,"" Hargrove said. Wal-Mart is the largest private employer in the United States and employs 1.5 million workers, which includes store staff, store management and truck drivers.The managerial raises went into effect in September when Wal-Mart paid more than $201 million in second-quarter bonuses to hourly store staff as 99 percent of its stores met targets for cleanliness, faster checkout and better service. Earlier this year, Wal-Mart increased entry level wages to $10 an hour and in December 2015 said it would invest $2.7 billion in employee compensation and training over two years.These increases come at a time when the retailer is cutting back-office jobs and announced the elimination of about 7,000 positions, mostly in accounting and invoicing at its U.S. stores. The new overtime rule is likely to touch nearly every sector of the U.S. economy, with the biggest impact on retail, hospitality and restaurants.Last month, officials from 21 U.S. states filed a lawsuit claiming the new overtime rule will place a heavy burden on state budgets.

966,"   By Nandita Bose | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) is in talks with several mobile wallet companies to offer more payment options in its Wal-Mart Pay app, an executive at the world's largest retailer said, after signing up JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) last week. Starting next year, Chase Pay will become the first third-party digital wallet on Wal-Mart's website and app, they said on Thursday.Customers can pay within the app with any major credit, debit, pre-paid or Walmart gift card.Daniel Eckert, senior vice-president of services at Wal-Mart U.S., said in an interview late on Friday that the retailer would tweak its marketing for the app after the most frequent users turned out to be Gen X customers, born from 1965 to 1967, and baby boomers born from 1946 to 1964.""The target demographic during the launch of a technology product tends to be younger, more male, so we have had that target market in mind,"" Eckert said.U.S. mobile payments accounted for an estimated $67 billion in 2015, and are expected to grow this year to $83 billion, or 24 percent of all purchases made via smartphones, according to the latest Forrester Research data. Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) Apple Pay or Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Android Pay are the most popular digital wallets, and U.S. retailers have launched many mobile payment apps in the last two years. But acceptance has been slow, largely because most systems require new equipment at stores.Wal-Mart Pay was launched in December 2015 and can be used in all of the retailer's 4,600 U.S. stores.  Customers at the checkout counter must choose the payment option within the app on their smartphone, and activate the camera to scan the code at the register.An e-receipt is sent to the app.    Eckert also said more than 90 percent of transactions on the app involve customers are using the service more than three to four times a month.  He declined to give the overall number of users who use Wal-Mart Pay.    Wal-Mart leads a consortium of U.S. retailers developing a mobile wallet app called CurrentC. The group, which includes Target Corp (TGT.N) and Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N), said earlier this year it would delay launching the app after the project hit several roadblocks.

The National Retail Federation expects industry holiday sales to grow 3.6 percent this year to $655.8 billion.

Burt Flickinger, managing director of retail consultancy Strategic Resources Group, said investors should be more patient as Wal-Mart has taken the right steps to fix its business by raising workers' hourly wages, improving operations with cleaner stores and focusing on increasing e-commerce sales.""The Street is making a myopic mistake of punishing Wal-Mart's shares today over quarterly sales and profits,"" he said.Wal-Mart raised the low end of its fiscal-year profit forecast, in line with Target Corp and other rivals that expressed optimism ahead of the holiday shopping season.Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said declining prices for eggs and other important products for a food retailer remained challenging, and unseasonably warm weather hurt sales in the back half of the quarter.

975,"   By Toby Sterling | AMSTERDAM  AMSTERDAM Wal-Mart's (WMT.N) determination to remain the cheapest U.S. food retailer in the face of competition from German discount stores has pressured Ahold-Delhaize's (AD.AS) business in the U.S., the company's CEO said in an interview on Thursday.Ahold Delhaize, the Dutch-Belgian retailer that runs U.S. supermarket chains Stop & Shop, Giant, Hannaford and Food Lion, among others, earlier reported a 4.3 percent rise in third-quarter underlying operating income, to 513 million euros ($549 million) but missed analyst expectations due to its U.S. performance.    CEO Dick Boer said in an interview that the stores most feeling the pinch were its Food Lion shops, of which there are 1,100 situated in Southern U.S. states.“During the second and third quarter, there was aggressive pricing from Wal-Mart, it's well known in the market, and of course we had to follow to keep our competitive position,"" he said.For several years, Food Lion has been cutting prices, emphasizing fresh produce and remodeling stores to make them easier for customers to navigate and find on-sale items.Boer noted that despite price deflation of nearly 1.5 percent in the areas where Food Lion, the core of Delhaize's U.S. business, competes, the chain had grown sales by 1.3 percent in the past recent quarter, which he said was evidence of its resilience. The division's growth on a like for like basis however was down from 1.6 percent in the same period a year ago, and operating margins fell to 3.5 percent from 3.8 percent. Boer said Ahold Delhaize is keenly aware of the ongoing U.S. expansion of German retailer Aldi, and plans by another German discount chain, Lidl, to open stores on the U.S. East Coast.""For sure, every competitor coming into a market is, for us, and for everyone I think, a signal to be more alert than before,” he said.“Aldi is known in the markets, clearly we have seen them continue to grow in the markets where we operate.” He cited the Philadelphia area as an example. “So that's what drives also I think the actions of Wal-Mart in the Southern states, to be sure that with the discounters coming in that Wal-Mart still keeps its price leadership,"" Boer said.""I think that's one of the promises they continue to want to make. This will have a continuing effect on our markets.""Wal-Mart on Thursday reported third quarter earnings with worse than expected sales, also due to falling food prices. [L1N1DI0IN] Boer said Ahold Delhaize is familiar with both German chains due to their growth in the Netherlands. Ahold Delhaize owns the dominant Dutch chain Albert Heijn, which has thrived despite a German onslaught.""As a European retailer in the U.S...we are sharing a lot of our information about the work Lidl and Aldi are doing (in the Dutch market) to help our American colleagues to be well prepared.”Boer also said he expects commodity price deflation, which has impacted meat and dairy prices, to ease next year. He said it was too early to say whether the election of Donald Trump as the next U.S. president would lead to higher inflation, as some investors are speculating.Ahold Delhaize shares were down 3.5 percent at 19.92 euros at 1600 GMT in Amsterdam.

The NRF expects total sales this holiday season to increase by 3.6 percent to $655.8 billion.Amazon, which also discounted heavily, said on Friday the number of items sold this Black Friday would surpass last year.Apart from electronics, beauty products and overall sold well over the holiday weekend, analysts said, but handbag sales were muted.Overall, traffic trends appeared to be healthy, with strength at footwear maker UGG, owned by Decker's Outdoor Corp , and Gap Inc, the biggest surprises, Jefferies & Co analysts said in a client note.

990,"   By Daniel Wiessner  Wal-Mart Stores Inc on Friday said it would pay $7.5 million to settle a U.S. lawsuit claiming it discriminated against gay employees nationwide by denying health benefits to their spouses.Wal-Mart and lawyers for Jacqueline Cote, the worker who filed the 2015 lawsuit in federal court in Boston, said in a court filing that the money may be split among more than 1,000 people who were denied spousal benefits between 2011 and 2014, when Wal-Mart changed its policy. The settlement must be approved by a federal judge.Sally Welborn, a senior vice president at Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart, said in a statement that diversity and inclusion were among the company's core values. ""We will continue to not distinguish between same and opposite sex spouses when it comes to the benefits we offer under our health insurance plan,"" she said. Wal-Mart, the largest private U.S. employer, began offering health insurance benefits to same-sex spouses in 2014, a year after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a provision of the federal Defense of Marriage Act that denied benefits to married gay couples.Cote, who has worked at Wal-Mart stores in Maine and Massachusetts since 1999, said in the lawsuit that her wife, Diana Smithson, developed cancer in 2012 and Wal-Mart's denial of insurance coverage led to more than $150,000 in medical debt. Smithson died in March. Cote in a statement on Friday said she was pleased with the settlement.""It's a relief to bring this chapter of my life to a close,"" she said. Federal employment discrimination laws do not explicitly provide protections for gay workers. But LGBT groups and the Obama administration have aggressively pushed the argument that bias against gay people is a form of sex discrimination, and three federal appeals courts are currently considering that claim. The case is Jacqueline Cote v. Wal-Mart Stores Inc, U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, No. 15-cv-12945.
