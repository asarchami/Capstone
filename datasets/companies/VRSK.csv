2,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, December 17 (Fitch) In Fitch Ratings' view, Verisk Analytics, Inc.'s  (Verisk) 'A-' Issuer Default Rating (IDR) will not be affected by the $500  million incremental share repurchase program approved by the company's board of  directors. The program will be executed through an equivalent-sized accelerated  share repurchase program (ASR).  The ASR is incremental to the $280 million  remaining in the current share repurchase program as of Sept. 30, 2014. The  company anticipates funding the ASR with a combination of cash on hand and $150  million of incremental borrowings.  Verisk's dominant market position within its Property and Casualty (P&C)  insurance related businesses along with Fitch's view that Verisk's core products  are largely non-discretionary purchases for most if not all of its clients  provide sufficient flexibility within the current ratings to accommodate the  modest increase in leverage resulting from the ASR. Fitch estimates Verisk's  leverage increases to 1.8x on a pro forma basis from 1.6x on an actual basis as  of the LTM ended Sept. 30, 2014.  The pro forma leverage remains within the  company's 2x leverage target and Fitch's tolerance within the current rating.   Merger and Acquisition activity will remain core to Verisk's overall strategy to  grow the company's data and product offerings and expand internationally.  Fitch  believes the company's capital allocation strategy remains unchanged and focused  on maintaining its 2x leverage target.  The ratings have tolerance to exceed  targeted levels for an acquisition, with the expectation that leverage would be  reduced to target levels within a 12-to-18-month timeframe.   Verisk's decision to implement the ASR follows its election to discontinue  efforts to acquire EagleView Technology Corporation in a transaction valued at  $650 million, as a result of the vote by the Federal Trade Commission to  challenge the proposed transaction.       As of Sept. 30, 2014, the company had solid liquidity consisting of $432.5  million in cash, and full availability under its $990 million revolving credit  facility due 2019. Verisk's liquidity position and overall financial flexibility  is supported by anticipated free cash flow generation (FCF) which amounted to  approximately $358 million during the LTM period ended Sept. 30, 2014.  Fitch  calculates FCF to adjusted debt of 25%, which is solid for the ratings. Fitch  expects FCF to range from $350 million to $400 million during the ratings  horizon and FCF to adjusted debt to remain above 20%.  Verisk's maturity schedule is well laddered and within FCF expectations,  consisting of approximately $170 million due during 2015 and $50 million  scheduled to mature during 2016.   The ratings could be upgraded if the company were to target a more conservative  unadjusted leverage metric with a rationale for such a target. Ratings may be pressured if the company's performance does not materially meet  Fitch's expectations and leverage is unable to return to the 2x target level  within 18 months. While not expected, material share buyback activity or  additional debt-funded acquisitions that delayed the company's planned reduction  in leverage may also pressure the ratings. Fitch's ratings for Verisk and its wholly owned subsidiary, Insurance Services  Office, Inc., are as follows:  Verisk --Long-term IDR at 'A-';  --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'A-'. Insurance Services Office, Inc. (ISO)  --Long-term IDR at 'A-';  --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Revolving credit facility at 'A-'; --Unsecured private placement notes at 'A-'.

BakerMarch 9 Verisk Analytics Inc has agreed to acquire British energy data firm Wood Mackenzie for more than 1.85 billion pounds ($2.79 billion), according to a source familiar with the matter. Wood Mackenzie, a private research consultancy owned by buyout firm Hellman & Friedman LLC, is focused on gathering and analyzing data about the energy industry, and will expand Jersey City, New Jersey-based Verisk's offerings. Verisk is known primarily for providing risk assessment data to the insurance industry.The deal could be announced as early as Tuesday, the source said, not wanting to be named because the agreement has not been officially announced. Representatives for Wood Mackenzie, Verisk and Hellman & Friedman could not immediately be reached for comment. Hellman & Friedman bought Edinburgh, Scotland-based Wood Mackenzie in 2012.

7,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 28 (Fitch) Verisk Analytics, Inc.'s (Verisk) 'BBB+' Issuer  Default Rating (IDR) is not affected by today's announcement that the company is  exploring strategic alternatives for Verisk Health (Health), its healthcare  analytics business, according to Fitch Ratings. Verisk is exploring alternatives  given Health's lower margins and proprietary data concentration, and greater  competition and capital intensity relative to Verisk's other businesses.  In  addition, current valuations in the healthcare space are attractive. Verisk did  not disclose terms of any potential transaction.  Fitch expects that sale proceeds will be used to repay bank debt, accelerating  Verisk's efforts to de-lever back to the company's target leverage of 2.5x. As  of the last 12 months ended Sept. 30, 2015, Fitch estimates Verisk's pro forma  total leverage to be approximately 2.9x (incorporates a full year of Wood  Mackenzie [Wood Mac] which closed in May 2015.)  Fitch believes that a Health transaction would improve Verisk's operational  profile as exposure to transactional sales would decline and overall margins  would improve. Additionally, it would reduce Verisk's overall revenue volatility  and its exposure to consolidation in the healthcare market.  Fitch's ratings incorporate the expectation that Verisk will de-lever back to  2.5x by year-end 2016 given strong free cash flow (FCF) generation. Fitch  projects annual pro forma FCF of approximately $515 million to $615 million  (includes full year of Wood Mac and excludes Health.). Fitch notes that  management has a demonstrated track record of de-levering to target levels  following debt-funded acquisitions. Although Fitch assumes Verisk would use  proceeds from a potential Health transaction to repay bank debt, we do not  believe such an action is required for Verisk to de-lever back to 2.5x by  year-end 2016. In May 2015, Verisk completed the acquisition of Wood Mac, a UK-based data  analytics company focused on the energy, metals and mining and agricultural  spaces, for approximately $2.89 billion. The acquisition was financed by a  combination of approximately $721.9 million in net proceeds from a common stock  offering, $50 million from cash on hand, and $2.11 billion  from the issuance of  debt and borrowings under the revolving credit facility (RCF). As of Sept. 30, 2015 the company had solid liquidity consisting of $168.8  million in cash, and $850 million available under its $1.75 billion RCF due May  2020. Verisk's liquidity position and overall financial flexibility is supported  by FCF. Verisk reported $481 million in FCF as of September 2015. Verisk will  have no material maturities until 2019 when $250 million in unsecured notes is  due. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch does not anticipate an upgrade within the rating horizon given the  elevated leverage and the company's recent increase in its total leverage target  from 2.0x to 2.5x. Fitch could upgrade the ratings if the company were to return  to its previous leverage target of 2x with a rationale for such target and  FCF-to-adjusted debt in the 20%-25% range. Ratings may be pressured if the company's performance does not materially meet  Fitch's expectations and leverage is unable to return to the 2.5x target level.  While not expected, material share-buyback activity or additional debt-funded  acquisitions that delayed the company's planned leverage reduction may also  pressure the ratings. Fitch currently rates Verisk as follows: Verisk --Long-term IDR 'BBB+'; --Short-term IDR 'F2'; --Revolving credit facility 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured notes 'BBB+'.
