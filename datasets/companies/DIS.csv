Both will compete in the best picture race, along with Sony's hostage drama ""Captain Phillips"" and Warner Bros. computer-age romance ""Her.""One young producer, 27-year-old Megan Ellison, solidified her stature in Hollywood, grabbing two nominations for backing ""American Hustle"" and ""Her."" Ellison, the daughter of billionaire Oracle Corp co-founder Larry Ellison, runs production company Annapurna Pictures, which also produced a Sony nominee last year, ""Zero Dark Thirty.""Ellison is only the fourth person, and the first woman, to earn two best picture nominations in the same year.The other films competing for the best picture statue are ""12 Years a Slave"" from 20th Century Fox ; ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" and ""Nebraska"" from Viacom Inc's Paramount Pictures; ""Dallas Buyers Club"" from Comcast Corp's  Universal Pictures; and ""Philomena"" from the privately held Weinstein Company. Nominations invariably prompt an uptick in ticket sales for movies still playing in theaters, as studios are quick to roll out updated TV spots and plaster the news elsewhere.When Warner Brothers' Oscar-winning film ""Argo"" was nominated last year for the award, ticket sales jumped by 59 percent the next weekend, according to movie tracking service Rentrak.In 2012 the Weinstein Company put its film ""the Artist"" into 446 more theaters the weekend after the movie won a Golden Globe award, making it a front runner for the Oscar. Ticket sales nearly doubled. The film went on to win an Oscar. The Weinstein Company added another 235 theaters three days after ""The Artist"" was nominated for an Academy Award, increasing ticket sales by another 40 percent.""The nominations give studios new life for a film that may have played out and is headed for DVD,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Rentrak. ""That's why they spend so much money to get the nomination. They get it back.""For Sony, the nominations could particularly boost ""American Hustle,"" which earned nods in all four acting categories and will play in 2,200 theaters this weekend. ""Captain Phillips"" will be showing in 900 locations.""American Hustle"" and ""Captain Phillips,"" two modestly budgeted films, have already earned a combined $343 million around the world.

17,"   By Lisa Richwine | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Wall Street expects two new princesses and a muscular Marvel superhero to help lift Walt Disney Co's quarterly results, as the company reaps the benefits of strong performances from film sequel ""Thor: The Dark World"" and animated musical mega-hit ""Frozen.""On Wednesday, the media and theme park operator is forecast to report $1.6 billion in net income for the December quarter, a 14 percent gain from a year earlier, according to the average estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. They expect earnings of 91 cents a share.Disney's movie studio helped boost the results, analysts said, with big box office grosses for ""Frozen"" and ""Thor.""The story of royal sisters in an icy kingdom, ""Frozen"" is the fourth-highest grossing animated film released by Disney, so far collecting $868 million worldwide.""It is just blowing everyone away with how successful it is, how popular it is and how profitable we think it will be,"" said FBR Capital Markets & Co analyst Barton Crockett, who rates Disney ""outperform.""Crockett on January 29 increased his Disney earnings estimate for the December quarter by 6 cents to 91 cents per share, partly due to the unexpected strength of ""Frozen."" Before it opened in November, he expected the film would gross about $200 million. He now expects it will approach $1 billion. Cowen & Co analyst Doug Creutz raised his quarterly revenue estimates for Disney last week by $180 million to $12.54 billion, primarily on higher estimates for the movie division. He forecasts the studio will generate $362 million in operating income this quarter, up 55 percent from $234 million a year ago.""Thor: The Dark World,"" a Marvel sequel about the god of thunder, has sold $635 million worth of tickets worldwide. With ""Frozen,"" the two have surpassed a combined $1.5 billion.CONSEQUENCES OF NEW STRATEGY  Disney's latest crop of films followed an overhaul that Chief Executive Bob Iger ordered in 2010. The studio began focusing on a smaller number of films from the Disney, Pixar and Marvel brands that had the potential to become franchises that bring in box office receipts, spawn movie sequels, drive toy sales and inspire theme-park rides.In 2013, Disney's movies collected $1.7 billion worth of tickets at U.S. and Canadian theaters, just behind the $1.9 billion for industry leader Warner Bros., according to Box Office Mojo. Disney's returns came from 17 films, half as many as the 34 for Warner Bros., a unit of Time Warner Inc.Disney released three of last year's top six films. ""Iron Man 3"" was the year's second-bestselling film, with $409 million. Number four, ""Frozen"" has sold nearly $359 million in the United States. ""Monsters University"" was sixth with $268 million. ""Frozen"" also marked the reemergence of Walt Disney Animation Studios, the company's traditional animation arm that had fallen behind the films produced by the company's Pixar unit, which Iger acquired in 2006 for $7.4 billion.Disney's studio also aggressively used characters from Marvel, the comic book and toy company it acquired in 2009 for $4 billion. It bought back the rights to ""Iron Man"" and ""Thor"" from Viacom's Paramount studio.Marvel helped the company make good on Iger's pledge to make films from which Disney could produce TV shows, sell toys and create rides. It created the TV show ""Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."" for ABC based on its 2012 blockbuster ""Marvel's The Avengers,"" the industry's third-largest film with $1.5 billion in worldwide ticket sales.But focusing on a smaller number of larger-budget flicks has a clear downside. The company produced a dud in big-budget Western ""The Lone Ranger"" starring Johnny Depp as sidekick Tonto. Disney said in August it would lose up to $190 million on the film.With fewer films, ""if they all hit, you are going to have great results,"" analyst Creutz said. ""The problem is, if one of them misses, you don't have a lot of other places to make them up.""(Reporting by Lisa Richwine; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)",2014-02-04,DIS,"Tue Feb 4, 2014 | 5:59pm EST",Hit movies expected to boost Disney quarterly results,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-disney-studio-idUSBREA131Q020140204?type=companyNews

25,"  By Ronald Grover  and Lisa RichwineLOS ANGELES Feb 5 The CBS television network won a bidding war to air eight Thursday night National Football League games during the 2014 season, giving it one of the most highly prized programs on a night coveted by TV advertisers.CBS and the NFL announced the deal on Wednesday.CBS, which competed against the NBC and Fox networks, ESPN and Turner Broadcasting System, had been considered a long shot at the outset of the bidding because of its strong Thursday night lineup, which includes TV's leading comedy ""The Big Bang Theory,"" and ratings mainstay ""Two and A Half Men.""The bidding was less than $300 million for the single-season contract, which includes a one-year option at the NFL's choice, according to a person with knowledge of the bids. Prices were lower than they might have been for such a prized property because the CBS games will simultaneously telecast on the NFL Network. ""This is about making a strong night even stronger,"" said CBS Chief Executive Officer Leslie Moonves in an interview with Reuters. ""This adds 32 great hours at a pretty reasonable price.""Moonves said the NFL games, which will be telecast early in the coming season, give CBS the ability to use its strong Thursday programs on other nights and help new shows gain an audience. The network's regular Thursday night lineup likely would start around Nov. 1, he said. The deal gives CBS the opportunity to do more things in the future with the NFL, Moonves said, although he said there are no plans for CBS to operate the NFL Network or for the games to migrate to the CBS Sports Network cable channel.""This was about helping to build the NFL brand on Thursday nights and the NFL Network,"" he said. ""This was about putting those games on a broadcast network.""CBS, a unit of CBS Corp, already broadcasts NFL games on Sunday afternoon. Bids were also submitted by NBC, owned by Comcast Corp  ; Fox ; ESPN, owned by Walt Disney Co ; and TBS, owned by Time Warner, according to the person with knowledge of the bids.Shares of CBS were up 0.8 percent at $58.34 in afternoon trading.",2014-02-05,DIS,"Wed Feb 5, 2014 | 2:10pm EST",UPDATE 2-CBS wins bid to air eight Thursday night NFL football games,http://www.reuters.com//article/cbs-nfl-idUSL2N0LA1AM20140205?type=companyNews
26,"  * Initial jobless claims decline more than expected* Twitter slumps after results; LinkedIn off after the bell* Green Mountain surges on deal with Coca-Cola* Indexes up: Dow 1.22 pct, S&P 1.24 pct, Nasdaq 1.14 pctBy Rodrigo CamposNEW YORK, Feb 6 U.S. stocks posted their best day of the year on Thursday after a drop in applications for unemployment insurance boosted confidence in the economy and Disney's results overshot expectations.The rally came ahead of the widely-followed payrolls report for January due Friday, which some are expecting to be affected by the extreme weather that hit much of the United States. December's number was a much-lower-than-expected 74,000 and an upward revision wouldn't be a surprise.Initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 20,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 331,000. While the data has no direct bearing on January's employment report it bodes well for the jobs market and the overall economy. ""Investors recently have been choosing to look at the glass half empty data and not focus on the positives,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago.""Bad weather causes cancellations, flight problems, business closings. I'm hoping we get an upward revision to the December (payrolls) number tomorrow, but if we get a lousy number I'm not going to crawl under a rock.""Recent soft data added to jitters about growth in China and a selloff in emerging market currencies and stocks. But a near 6 percent decline on the S&P 500 from its record high last month to the session low Wednesday was seen by some as a buying opportunity, as earnings continue to grow.Walt Disney was the most recent bellwether to beat expectations as its profit topped estimates, sending its shares up 5.3 percent to $75.56. Disney led gains on both the Dow industrials and S&P 500. According to Thomson Reuters data, of the 330 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings through Thursday morning, 68.8 percent have topped Wall Street expectations, above the 63 percent beat rate since 1994 and the 67 percent rate for the past four quarters.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 188.3 points or 1.22 percent, to 15,628.53, the S&P 500 gained 21.79 points or 1.24 percent, to 1,773.43 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 45.57 points or 1.14 percent, to 4,057.122.It was the largest daily percentage gain for the S&P 500 and Dow since mid-December. However, the S&P was on track for its fourth consecutive negative week, a streak not seen since July-August of 2011.Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, one of the most shorted stocks on Wall Street, surged 26.2 percent to $102.10. Coca-Cola bought a 10 percent stake for $1.25 billion and said it would help launch Green Mountain's new cold drink machine. Coke shares gained 1.1 percent to $38.03 while home beverage device maker SodaStream International rose 7.2 percent to $38.35.The Nasdaq also received a boost from Akamai Technologies , which soared 20.6 percent to $57.18 after forecasting better-than-expected results.Bucking the bullish trend, Spirit AeroSystems shares fell 19.6 percent to $26.51.

While the data has no direct bearing on January's employment report, as it falls outside the survey period, it bodes well for the jobs market and the overall economy. ""Investors recently have been choosing to look at the glass half empty data and not focus on the positives,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago.""Bad weather causes cancellations, flight problems, business closings. I'm hoping we get an upward revision to the December (payrolls) number tomorrow, but if we get a lousy number I'm not going to crawl under a rock.""The recent soft data added to jitters about growth in China and a selloff in emerging market currencies and stocks. But a near 6 percent decline on the S&P 500 was seen by some as a buying opportunity, as earnings continue to grow.Walt Disney was the most recent bellwether to beat expectations as its profit topped estimates, sending its shares up 5.4 percent to $75.61. Disney led gains on both the Dow industrials and S&P 500. According to Thomson Reuters data, of the 330 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings through Thursday morning, 68.8 percent have topped Wall Street expectations, above the 63 percent beat rate since 1994 and the 67 percent rate for the past four quarters.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 178.66 points or 1.16 percent, to 15,618.89, the S&P 500 gained 21.4 points or 1.22 percent, to 1,773.04 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 48.395 points or 1.21 percent, to 4,059.947.Despite the gains, the S&P 500 was on track for its fourth consecutive negative week, something it hasn't done since July-August of 2011.Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, one of the most shorted stocks on Wall Street, surged 29.6 percent to $104.85 as the top boost to the Nasdaq 100 index.

Friday's payrolls report may not provide a clearer indication of the economy's health after last month's disappointing number. ""All eyes are on tomorrow's employment report number, although whatever it is, it's going to be quickly dismissed because of weather.

33,"   By Diane Bartz | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Consumer advocates and U.S. lawmakers are worried that Comcast Corp's proposed $45 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable Inc will create a company with too much power to decide what Americans can watch on television and do online, and they expect intense regulatory scrutiny of the deal.Their concerns are intertwined with a recent court decision to overturn U.S. open Internet rules, which enforced the principle that Internet service providers should treat all Web traffic equally and should not give preferential treatment to their own movies, websites and content. Comcast, a major provider of Internet services, is committed to network neutrality until 2018.Separately, some media companies are concerned that Comcast would attempt to pay them less for their television shows, movies and other content, and have scheduled discussions with their attorneys with an eye toward lobbying regulators in Washington, said an antitrust attorney who spoke privately to protect business relationships.Comcast's proposed takeover of Time Warner Cable would combine the country's top two cable providers into a colossus that could reshape the U.S. pay television and broadband Internet industry. The deal would put Comcast in 19 of the nation's 20 largest TV markets.The deal will be reviewed by the Federal Communications Commission and either the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission, the two agencies that share antitrust oversight in the United States.Eight antitrust experts interviewed by Reuters were split on whether the merger would be approved. While Comcast has agreed to divest 3 million Time Warner Cable subscribers to keep their combined share of the U.S. pay television market at under 30 percent, it is unclear if that is enough to satisfy antitrust regulators, the experts said.A Comcast-Time Warner combination could be especially troubling in light of the court ruling that struck down FCC rules aimed at preventing broadband service providers from favoring one website over another, said Bert Foer, head of the American Antitrust Institute.""I hope it (the deal) is going to be fought tooth and nail,"" said Foer. ""You're creating this giant and you're doing it in the absence of a network neutrality rule. That's dangerous to democracy.""Foer said that agreements between Comcast and federal agencies that were put in place at the time of the Comcast and NBC Universal merger in 2011 to assure network neutrality would end in 2018 and were nothing more than a ""short-term bandage.""NOTHING BUT NET  The advocacy group Consumer Watchdog bluntly called on the FCC and Department of Justice to block the creation of ""an unjustifiable monopoly"" that could raise prices to customers and would have ""no incentive to improve broadband service.""Antitrust authorities often challenge mergers or extract concessions when head-to-head competition would be diluted, although there are few areas of the United States where two cable companies compete directly.Reed Hundt, FCC chairman during the Clinton administration, said the current spotlight on the issue of open internet principles meant the commission would carefully examine the size and power of the new combined company.""The FCC will look at that broadband market share and they will say, 'Chairman Wheeler promised an open internet, what does this deal mean for that?'"" he said. ""The FCC will take a hard look at what is the durable, long-lasting, truly open internet commitment,"" Hundt said.Robert McDowell, a former FCC commissioner who voted to approve Comcast's acquisition of NBC Universal, said the company could be asked to extend its net neutrality commitment, and if they do so, chances of approval are good.""Comcast understood going into this that they'll have to agree to at least all of the same merger conditions that were put into the NBC merger deal plus some other things too. They will probably see an extension of the term of those conditions,"" McDowell said.

No date has been set so far.The Republican-run House Judiciary Committee is also expected to hold a hearing ""to ensure that the interests of American consumers and overall competition in the marketplace is protected.""Senator Al Franken was a critic of Comcast's previous deal with NBC Universal.

39,"   By Adam Jourdan | SHANGHAI  SHANGHAI PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N) has signed a deal to supply beverages to Walt Disney Co's (DIS.N) first China resort, breaking The Coca-Cola Co's (KO.N) quarter century monopoly over beverage supply to the U.S. theme park operator.PepsiCo and its partner in China, Tingyi Cayman Islands Holding Corp (0322.HK), will exclusively provide beverages to the Shanghai Disney Resort, its first on mainland China which is set to open at the end of 2015, PepsiCo, Disney and Tingyi said in a joint statement on Thursday.Coca-Cola has had a long-standing tie-up with Disney, while it has been at least 25 years since PepsiCo last sold its beverages through the theme park chain, a Dubai-based PepsiCo spokesman said.The deal is only a tiny segment of China's 421 billion yuan ($68.74 billion) soft drink sector, but marks a blow for PepsiCo against Coke in the highly competitive market, where both brands are coming under increasing pressure from Chinese rivals and changing consumer tastes for local flavors.""I wonder what kind of message it sends to Coke globally. Even though the Disney park is only one small thing, China has massive room to grow for the Disney brand. Tying up this deal could mean good things going forward,"" said Ben Cavender, Shanghai-based principal at China Market Research Group.Disney said it currently has no plans to ink similar deals with PepsiCo to supply its other resorts, although it is ""actively pursuing opportunities in a variety of different sectors,"" Murray King, vice president of public affairs for the Shanghai Disney Resort, said. The PepsiCo spokesman said he could not comment on whether PepsiCo and Disney planned other tie-ups. Disney has a further 11 theme parks and 44 resorts around the world, according to its official website.PEPSI VS COKE Coca-Cola edges the China market with a 15.7 percent share of China's soft drinks market in 2012, ahead of PepsiCo's 4.5 percent share by off-trade volume, according to data from Euromonitor. China's soft drinks sector is worth around 421 billion yuan ($69.12 billion). Chinese consumers are increasingly opting for healthier alternatives in food and drink, which has also hit growth for fast food chains such as McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) and KFC-parent Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N).Coca-Cola remains the soft drinks supplier for Disney resorts outside mainland China. It is the beverage provider for Disney's 11 parks in the United States, Hong Kong, France and Japan, a Singapore-based spokeswoman for Coca-Cola said.""The Coca-Cola Company and The Walt Disney Company share a long-standing partnership that dates to the first Disney television show in 1950 and the first Disneyland theme park in 1955. Today, our global partnership with Disney is as strong as ever,"" she added in emailed comments to Reuters. Though it retains the biggest market share in China, but local rivals are catching up. Pepsi's partner in the market, Taiwanese Tingyi, raised its market share from 9.9 percent in 2007 to 12.8 percent in 2012, according to Euromonitor.Tingyi and PepsiCo beverages will be the sole range of drinks sold at the Shanghai park, a Tingyi spokesman said. All three companies declined to put a value on the deal.The key question for Pepsi is if it can leverage its tie-up with Disney outside the limits of the resort, said Cavender.""If they can do more Disney-themed adverts elsewhere I can see this benefiting them a lot, and the fact Disney switched from Coke to Pepsi here could mean big things for the years ahead in other markets too,"" he said.

(link.reuters.com/mur47v)The studio said the multi-year partnership with Shanghai Media will expand training opportunities between Chinese and American writers and filmmakers.Tony To, the studio's executive vice president of production, will oversee the co-development program, which could allow for easier releases of English-language films in China.

70,"   By Lisa Richwine and Ronald Grover  Walt Disney Co shareholders are expected to vote at its March 18 annual meeting on a resolution that asks the company to allow large shareholders to nominate board members, the latest bid by investor groups to win ""proxy access"" rights.The Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds and the California State Teachers Retirement System proposed that the board allow owners of at least 3 percent of the company's stock be empowered to nominate up to 20 percent of the board, according to a regulatory filing from Disney on January 24. Under the non-binding proxy access proposal, shareholders must own their stake for three years before they have nomination rights.The company's shareholders rejected a similar proposal last year, with 40 percent voting in support.""Disney is a bellwether company and the vote will get a lot of attention,"" said Robert McCormick, chief policy officer of proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis, which has advised its clients to vote for the measure. This year, shareholders at as many as 20 companies will consider proxy access proposals, said Patrick McGurn, special counsel to proxy advisory firm ISS that has advised Disney shareholders to approve the measure. Of three shareholder votes so far this year, the non-binding proposal was adopted at slot machine maker International Game Technology and rejected at Apple Inc and Walgreen Co.On February 28, Apple shareholders soundly defeated such a measure, with only 4 percent of those casting votes in support of a non-binding resolution that would allow investors holding between 1 percent and 5 percent to nominate up to 24 percent of the board. Last year, 12 companies had the measure on their ballots, according to ISS, with shareholders at Verizon and CenturyLink approving proxy access. Among those who voted it down with Disney shareholders in 2013 were those at Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Staples and Netflix Inc.Proponents of the measure for the upcoming Disney meeting say the access to the nomination process would ""more easily promote independent director candidates to enhance accountability to shareholders,"" according to the regulatory filing from Disney.

72,"  By Ross KerberBOSTON, March 17 Big U.S. companies appear to have handed out smaller increases in compensation to their chief executives in 2013 than in 2012, mainly as a result of reduced grants of stock options, according to an early review of annual regulatory filings.Based on disclosures from 46 companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index that had filed annual compensation reports by March 11, the median compensation increase for a CEO was 1 percent to $8.64 million.That was a slower rate of increase than this group of 46 received for 2012 when its median CEO pay rose 15 percent to $8.53 million. The median compensation for CEOs in S&P 500 companies overall increased about 5.5 percent for 2012.The review, conducted for Reuters by proxy adviser and corporate governance consulting firm Institutional Shareholder Services, provides an early peek at compensation trends but ISS cautioned that there could be significant changes once all companies have reported and that the 46 companies may not be  representative of trends for companies in the entire index. Most companies will file their executive compensation data over the next few weeks.Some pay experts have been expecting to see slower growth in compensation for 2013 - despite the bull market in stocks - as S&P 500 corporate profits only increased 6.2 percent amid a stuttering U.S. economic performance, and due to the increasing use of performance measures to decide on levels of compensation.In the kinds of incentive plans becoming more popular, executives do not receive higher compensation just because a company's share price rises, but rather must perform well on a series of measures - not just profit, but often including revenue, margins, cash flow, and in some cases even a company's safety and environment records.""They're not going to get monster rewards,"" said Alan Johnson, managing director of pay consulting firm Johnson Associates in New York. ""The indications are that companies continue to do a better job of matching up pay with performance.""However, the figures are unlikely to assuage concerns that CEOs are reaping bigger increases than those received by many Americans further down the food chain, exacerbating inequality. President Barack Obama has been stressing policies intended to reduce inequality, such as a push for a higher minimum wage.The study looks at what was granted to CEOs for 2013 and does not include all the compensation CEOs actually pocketed in 2013 after stock and option awards granted to them in previous years were exercised or vested. With the S&P 500 surging 32.4 percent last year, including dividends, and almost tripling from the lows it hit in the financial crisis, some of those awards from 2009-2012 have proven very lucrative. A separate review by executive compensation data firm Equilar of 44 companies in the Fortune 1,000 that filed their statements in January or February shows that the median value executives gained from exercising stock options or stock vesting was $2.1 million in 2013, up 18 percent from 2012.RADICAL CHANGES Investor activists and proxy advisers, including ISS, have pressed companies for years to align pay with shareholder interests. In recent weeks, a handful of companies have made radical changes in the way they reward their CEOs, including semiconductor maker Intel Corp and mining group Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.Among the 46 S&P 500 companies surveyed, the median cash salary rose $27,584, or 2.6 percent, to $1,079,327. But the median stock award rose $337,493, or 9.5 percent, to $3,887,008, and the median cash incentive award rose $63,799, or 3.3 percent, to $1,998,102.Restraining the overall increase, though, were less generous stock options awards. Of the 46 companies, only 32 of them awarded stock options to their CEOs in 2013, down from 35 in 2012. For those 35 companies (including those who did not grant options in 2013), the average award fell by $548,543, or 23 percent, to $1,880,476 in 2013.Some companies said they reduced their option awards as they wanted to reduce the incentive to take certain risks. At financial services company Comerica Inc, total compensation for CEO Ralph Babb fell 10 percent to $6.46 million, as the value of his option awards fell to $314,729 from $1,047,682 in 2012. Comerica said in a filing it cut the weighting of stock option awards during the year to ""discourage inappropriate risk taking and better align with regulatory expectations."" At paint maker Sherwin-Williams, total compensation for CEO Christopher Connor fell 1.5 percent to $10.8 million, as the value of stock option awards fell to $3 million from $3.3 million in 2012. The company said in a filing that it has de-emphasized stock options in favor of stock awards related to performance to provide more focus on operating performance.""Most CEOs get it, an increase in stock price is going to be their greatest opportunity for compensation,"" said David Dorman, an investor and board member at a series of companies, including  network technology company Motorola Solutions Inc, pharmacy group CVS Caremark Corp and KFC and Pizza Hut owner Yum! Brands Inc.He said that generally compensation for executives in corporate America ""will be in a pretty tight range.""A few caveats apply to the ISS figures. They do not include set-asides for executive pensions and other deferred obligations, which are often established by formula. At some companies these set-asides fell in 2013 as interest rates rose.John Roe, ISS's executive director of corporate services, said companies have embraced new forms of pay. ""For the companies in this sample, it was a year of compensation adjustments rather than increases,"" he said.REFORMS SPREAD  The ISS review focused mainly on median figures as a way to exclude results from companies at the top and bottom of the pay scale that could distort the conclusions.On an average basis, CEOs among the early S&P 500 filers received $9.34 million in compensation in 2013 - an increase of 2 percent from the average in 2012.Since 2011, most U.S. companies have submitted their pay plans for non-binding shareholder votes amid concerns about excessive executive compensation.While investors have largely supported management, the contests have given some leverage to reformers, particularly as activist investors press companies to make pay depend on relative measures like share price versus peers.The pressure has made a difference at some companies.For example, Freeport got only 29 percent support from shareholders for its executive compensation plan last year. Citing shareholder views, the company on March 3 filed a plan that would cut in half the salaries of its three top executives to $1.25 million from $2.5 million.The company also said it gave them an annual compensation goal of $7.5 million, with the final figures to be based on the company's operating cash flow, copper and oil production volumes, and performance on safety and environmental scores. Executives could still earn more than that if the company outperforms peers.All of the elements, except for the base salary, are ""at risk"" and could be worth nothing in a bad year, Freeport spokesman Eric Kinneberg said via email.  There is ""real potential downside if performance is not good.""Other companies that reworked pay after facing vigorous opposition to its executive compensation policies from some shareholders include Intel, which won 68 percent support last year, and Walt Disney Co with 58 percent. (Intel and Disney were not among the 46 companies in the study as Intel has yet to file its proxy statement and Disney has a fiscal year ending in September)Disney said in a filing that it reduced the bonus paid to Chief Executive Robert Iger by almost $3 million to $13.6 million for fiscal 2013 after the company's results did not beat certain goals.Intel last month outlined changes for its new CEO Brian Krzanich such as allowing equity awards to fall in value if returns for shareholders don't meet targets. Although Krzanich was promoted to the CEO job last May his compensation was less in 2013, $9.1 million, than the $15.7 million he got in 2012 when he was chief operating officer. It is also less than half the $18.3 million his predecessor as CEO - Paul Otellini - got in 2012.Brit Wittman, Intel's director of executive compensation, said the changes were made because shareholders wanted pay to be more closely tied to performance, especially after the financial crisis soured many on pay models that once were widely used.""Pay for failure really seems to alienate investors,"" he said.",2014-03-17,DIS,"Mon Mar 17, 2014 | 8:00am EDT",RPT-INSIGHT-Growth in compensation for U.S. CEOs may have slowed,http://www.reuters.com//article/compensation-ceos-idUSL2N0ME02O20140317?type=companyNews

For those 35 companies (including those who did not grant options in 2013), the average award fell by $548,543, or 23 percent, to $1,880,476 in 2013.Some companies said they reduced their option awards as they wanted to reduce the incentive to take certain risks. At financial services company Comerica Inc, total compensation for CEO Ralph Babb fell 10 percent to $6.46 million, as the value of his option awards fell to $314,729 from $1,047,682 in 2012. Comerica said in a filing it cut the weighting of stock option awards during the year to ""discourage inappropriate risk taking and better align with regulatory expectations.""At paint maker Sherwin-Williams, total compensation for CEO Christopher Connor fell 1.5 percent to $10.8 million, as the value of stock option awards fell to $3 million from $3.3 million in 2012. The company said in a filing that it has de-emphasized stock options in favor of stock awards related to performance to provide more focus on operating performance. ""Most CEOs get it, an increase in stock price is going to be their greatest opportunity for compensation,"" said David Dorman, an investor and board member at a series of companies, including  network technology company Motorola Solutions Inc, pharmacy group CVS Caremark Corp and KFC and Pizza Hut owner Yum! Brands Inc.He said that generally compensation for executives in corporate America ""will be in a pretty tight range.""A few caveats apply to the ISS figures. They do not include set-asides for executive pensions and other deferred obligations, which are often established by formula. At some companies these set-asides fell in 2013 as interest rates rose.John Roe, ISS's executive director of corporate services, said companies have embraced new forms of pay. ""For the companies in this sample, it was a year of compensation adjustments rather than increases,"" he said.REFORMS SPREAD  The ISS review focused mainly on median figures as a way to exclude results from companies at the top and bottom of the pay scale that could distort the conclusions.On an average basis, CEOs among the early S&P 500 filers received $9.34 million in compensation in 2013 - an increase of 2 percent from the average in 2012.Since 2011, most U.S. companies have submitted their pay plans for non-binding shareholder votes amid concerns about excessive executive compensation.While investors have largely supported management, the contests have given some leverage to reformers, particularly as activist investors press companies to make pay depend on relative measures like share price versus peers.The pressure has made a difference at some companies.For example, Freeport got only 29 percent support from shareholders for its executive compensation plan last year. Citing shareholder views, the company on March 3 filed a plan that would cut in half the salaries of its three top executives to $1.25 million from $2.5 million.The company also said it gave them an annual compensation goal of $7.5 million, with the final figures to be based on the company's operating cash flow, copper and oil production volumes, and performance on safety and environmental scores. Executives could still earn more than that if the company outperforms peers.All of the elements, except for the base salary, are ""at risk"" and could be worth nothing in a bad year, Freeport spokesman Eric Kinneberg said via email.  There is ""real potential downside if performance is not good.""Other companies that reworked pay after facing vigorous opposition to its executive compensation policies from some shareholders include Intel, which won 68 percent support last year, and Walt Disney Co with 58 percent. (Intel and Disney were not among the 46 companies in the study as Intel has yet to file its proxy statement and Disney has a fiscal year ending in September)Disney said in a filing that it reduced the bonus paid to Chief Executive Robert Iger by almost $3 million to $13.6 million for fiscal 2013 after the company's results did not beat certain goals.Intel last month outlined changes for its new CEO Brian Krzanich such as allowing equity awards to fall in value if returns for shareholders don't meet targets. Although Krzanich was promoted to the CEO job last May his compensation was less in 2013, $9.1 million, than the $15.7 million he got in 2012 when he was chief operating officer. It is also less than half the $18.3 million his predecessor as CEO - Paul Otellini - got in 2012.Brit Wittman, Intel's director of executive compensation, said the changes were made because shareholders wanted pay to be more closely tied to performance, especially after the financial crisis soured many on pay models that once were widely used.""Pay for failure really seems to alienate investors,"" he said.",2014-03-17,DIS,"Mon Mar 17, 2014 | 1:00am EDT",INSIGHT-Growth in compensation for U.S. CEOs may have slowed,http://www.reuters.com//article/compensation-ceos-idUSL2N0M60LM20140317?type=companyNews
74,"   By Lisa Richwine | PORTLAND, Oregon  PORTLAND, Oregon Walt Disney Co amended guidelines on Tuesday for the selection of its chairman, persuading investors to withdraw a proposal to grant large shareholders more say in electing directors just hours before it was to have gone to a vote.The last-minute change states that the chairman should be an independent director unless justified in writing. It averted a potential contest, and investors re-elected Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger and nine other directors to the media company's board at its annual shareholder meeting.Disney shareholders had been scheduled to vote on a ""proxy access"" resolution that asked the company to allow large shareholders to nominate board members. The change scrapped that vote, after the resolution's proponents agreed to withdraw their proposal, according to a regulatory filing from Disney.Iger's dual appointment as chairman and chief executive, in effect since 2012, has drawn criticism from some investors and driven support for the proposal. A similar resolution won the support of 40 percent of voters a year ago.The latest amendment to the guidelines allows for exceptions to the rule, provided the company justifies in writing annually why that would be in the best interests of shareholders.In such cases, Disney said it will also designate one independent director its lead director. ""The chairman of the board shall in the normal course be an independent director unless the board concludes that, in the light of the circumstances then present when any such decision is made, the best interests of shareholders would be otherwise better served,"" Disney said in its early morning filing.A Disney spokesman said on Tuesday that the amendment clarified a standard that the company's board had previously committed to.At the shareholder meeting, all current board members were re-elected with at least 92 percent of the vote. They include Twitter Inc Co-Founder Jack Dorsey, who joined the board in December, and Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. Iger won the support of 99 percent of ballots cast. The results are preliminary based on votes cast ahead of themeeting.Shareholders approved the compensation packages for Iger and other executives in a non-binding vote, with support coming from 80 percent of ballots cast. Disney's shares have surged 42 percent in the past year to $81.99 after strong results from cable TV sports juggernaut ESPN, theme parks and the company's movie studio, which is riding a $1 billion hit with Oscar-winning animated film ""Frozen.""Iger told shareholders that ""Frozen"" is now poised to become the highest-grossing animated film of all time, surpassing ""Toy Story 3"" from Disney's Pixar unit.He also revealed that the new ""Star Wars"" movie set for release in December 2015 will be set 30 years after 1983 film ""Episode VI: Return of the Jedi.""In addition, Disney's movie studio is planning sequels to Pixar's ""Cars"" and ""The Incredibles"" movies, Iger said.(Reporting by Lisa Richwine and San Francisco Newsroom; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)",2014-03-18,DIS,"Tue Mar 18, 2014 | 4:59pm EDT",Last-minute Disney policy change averts proxy access vote,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-disney-shareholders-idUSBREA2H1N720140318?type=companyNews

84,"   By Lisa Richwine | PORTLAND, Oregon  PORTLAND, Oregon The highly anticipated next installment of the ""Star Wars"" franchise will be set 30 years after ""Episode VI: Return of the Jedi,"" Walt Disney Co.'s chief executive officer Bob Iger said on Tuesday at the company's annual shareholders meeting.Disney purchased ""Star Wars"" production company LucasFilm for $4.05 billion in 2012 and announced it would release three new films in the popular sci-fi series. Fans have been avidly awaiting details of the next film, ""Star Wars: Episode VII.""""Return of the Jedi"" was the third film in the first trilogy of ""Star Wars"" released between 1977 and 1983. The series is set in a galaxy far, far away, in the past. Iger did not reveal any casting news, other than to confirm the return of the robot character R2D2. The official Star Wars website posted on Monday the new films would feature ""a trio of new young leads along with some very familiar faces,"" and that filming would begin in May at London's famed Pinewood studios. Rumors have swirled for over a year on whether some of the franchise's stars, including Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher, would return. Trade magazines have reported that rising stars including Oscar-winner Lupita Nyong'o and ""Girls"" actor Adam Driver were being considered.The ""Star Wars"" franchise was created by director George Lucas and comprises six films that have grossed more than $4.4 billion at the worldwide box office since the first film was released in 1977. ""Episode VII"" will be released on December 18, 2015, and will be directed by J.J. Abrams, who helmed the recent ""Star Trek"" film franchise reboot.(Reporting by Lisa Richwine; writing by Piya Sinha-Roy; Editing by Mary Milliken and Amanda Kwan)",2014-03-19,DIS,"Wed Mar 19, 2014 | 2:22pm EDT",New 'Star Wars' film to be set 30 years after 'Return of the Jedi',http://www.reuters.com//article/us-starwars-idUSBREA2H20A20140319?type=companyNews
85,"   By Lisa Richwine | PORTLAND, Oregon  PORTLAND, Oregon Walt Disney Co appeased large shareholders who demanded more say in the naming of directors and splitting of the chairman and chief executive officer jobs in the future, persuading them to withdraw a proposal hours before it was to have gone to a vote on Tuesday.A last-minute change in board guidelines specified that the chairman should be an independent director unless the company justifies it in writing. Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger has also served as chairman since 2012.The shareholder deal averted a contest, and investors re-elected Iger and nine other directors at Disney's annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday.Disney shareholders had originally been scheduled to vote on a ""proxy access"" resolution that asked the company to allow large shareholders to nominate board members. The resolution's proponents agreed to withdraw their proposal, according to a regulatory filing from Disney.Iger's dual appointment as chairman and chief executive has drawn criticism from some investors and driven support for the proposal. A similar resolution won the support of 40 percent of votes a year ago.The latest amendment to the guidelines allows for exceptions to the rule, provided the company justifies in writing annually why that would be in the best interests of shareholders.In such cases, Disney said it will also designate one independent director its lead director.""The chairman of the board shall in the normal course be an independent director unless the board concludes that, in the light of the circumstances then present when any such decision is made, the best interests of shareholders would be otherwise better served,"" Disney said in its early morning filing. A Disney spokesman said on Tuesday that the amendment clarified a standard that the company's board had previously committed to.At the shareholder meeting, all current board members were re-elected with at least 92 percent of the vote. They include Twitter Inc Co-Founder Jack Dorsey, who joined the board in December, and Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. Iger won the support of 99 percent of ballots cast.The results are preliminary based on votes cast ahead of themeeting.ISSUES WITH PAY?  Large shareholders said on Tuesday they would continue to talk to Disney about board transparency and compensation.The California State Teachers' Retirement System, known as CalSTRS, withdrew support for proxy access proposal after Disney amended guidelines. CalSTRS spokesman Ricardo Duran said this showed the company was working to address many of the concerns that prompted that resolution in the first place.But CalSTRS ""continues to have issues with the magnitude and structure of the current pay program for the CEO, despite the outstanding performance achieved during Mr. Iger's tenure,"" he added. Those issues included an ""emphasis on short-term performance with large cash payments.""Another investor, the Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds, said it reserved the right to re-file the proposal ""if the engagement between the co-filers and Disney does not continue to demonstrate transparency on board leadership issues."" Still, shareholders on Tuesday approved the compensation packages for Iger and other executives in a non-binding vote, with support coming from 80 percent of ballots cast.CalSTRS voted against that resolution, Duran said.Disney previously slashed Iger's compensation for fiscal 2013 for the year that ended in October by some 15 percent. His bonus was reduced by $3 million because Disney did not outperform his targets by the same ""extraordinary amount"" as in the previous year, the company said at the time.Disney's shares surged 42 percent in the past year to $81.99 after strong results from cable TV sports juggernaut ESPN, theme parks and the company's movie studio, which is riding a $1 billion hit with Oscar-winning animated film ""Frozen.""Iger told shareholders that ""Frozen"" is now poised to become the highest-grossing animated film of all time, surpassing ""Toy Story 3"" from Disney's Pixar unit.He also revealed that the new ""Star Wars"" movie set for release in December 2015 will be set 30 years after 1983 film ""Episode VI: Return of the Jedi.""In addition, Disney's movie studio is planning sequels to Pixar's ""Cars"" and ""The Incredibles"" movies, Iger said.(Reporting by Lisa Richwine and San Francisco Newsroom; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)",2014-03-19,DIS,"Tue Mar 18, 2014 | 8:35pm EDT",Last-minute Disney policy change averts proxy access vote,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-disney-shareholders-idUSBREA2H1N720140319?type=companyNews

Animated ""Mr. Peabody & Sherman,"" produced by Dreamworks Animation Inc, took the No. 3 slot with $11.7 million.""Divergent"" is adapted from a popular series of young adult novels by newcomer author Veronica Roth. Ahead of the weekend, forecasters had predicted the film would debut with between $50 million and $68 million in North American (U.S. and Canadian) ticket sales.Shailene Woodley stars in ""Divergent"" as Tris Prior, a teenager who doesn't fit in to a faction because she has multiple dominant personality traits, making her a threat to the government. She chooses to join the Dauntless faction of warriors who defend the society's inhabitants. British actor Theo James plays Four, Tris' mentor and love interest. The debut of ""Divergent"" fell short of the box office heights of two other young adult franchises. ""Hunger Games"" started with a massive $152.5 million in March 2012 while  ""Twilight"" opened with $69.6 million in November 2008.Lions Gate said Friday it was confident ""Divergent"" would become an important franchise for the company and it was moving ahead with the second film in the series, called ""Insurgent,"" which will reach theaters in March 2015.Noting that the ""Divergent"" opening was shy of blockbusters ""Hunger Games"" and ""Twilight,"" Jeff Bock, senior box office analyst at Exhibitor Relations Co., said ""$56 million is a great opening for any film,  and virtually locked down the proposed trilogy."" ""This is something to build on for the series, and with the cast expected to be in high demand, the 'Divergent' legacy will continue to grow,"" Bock added.Richie Fay, the studio's president of domestic distribution, said, ""We're very pleased with the outcome for the franchise launch.""The movie's A+ CinemaScore grade from the under-18 audience bodes well for the coming weeks as spring break and Easter school holidays approach, Fay said, noting, ""The young adult audience has been underserved in the last couple of weeks."" The company spent $85 million to produce ""Divergent,"" plus $40 million to $45 million on marketing, according to a person with knowledge of the film's budget. The studio has recouped about $70 million of the cost through international licensing deals, the person said.""Muppets Most Wanted,"" a sequel to a 2011 ""Muppets"" movie, stars Ricky Gervais, Tina Fey and Ty Burrell alongside Miss Piggy, Kermit the Frog and other classic Muppet characters. In the new film, Kermit is imprisoned in a Russian gulag in a case of mistaken identity, while an evil impostor travels with his muppet friends on a European tour.""Mr. Peabody and Sherman"" brought its global sales through three weekends to $172 million. The movie was distributed by 20th Century Fox.Rounding out the domestic charts, Greek warrior sequel ""300: Rise of an Empire"" landed in fourth place with $8.7 million, while the independent faith-based new release ""God's Not Dead"" pulled in $8.6 million to claim the No. 5 spot.Warner Brothers, a unit of Time Warner, released ""300: Rise of an Empire.""

Its producers target the younger millennial generation, known for its high appetite for online video. ""This gives a presence online to reach the millennial group that is increasingly getting its video online,"" said Kevin Mayer, Disney executive vice president for corporate strategy. ""And it gives us a lot of data to help promote our other businesses to them.""The deal will be ""mildly dilutive"" to earnings per share through fiscal 2017, Mayer said. Disney's fiscal year closes at the end of September. Maker helps produce and distribute videos to more than 380 million subscribers worldwide across more than 55,000 channels. Its videos now collectively garner some 5.5 billion views every month, according to the source.The company, whose backers include Time Warner Investments, Upfront Ventures and Greycroft Partners, is partners with PewDiePie, the online persona of 24 year-old video gamer Felix Kjellberg. Kjellberg has more than 25 million subscribers and is YouTube's single most-subscribed star.

""Iron Man 3"" was last year's second-highest grossing film with domestic ticket sales of $409 million, according to the site Box Office Mojo.In 2012, ""Marvel's The Avengers"" was the third-biggest film in Hollywood history, with $623.4 million in domestic sales and $1.5 billion worldwide.""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is ""a safe bet"" to pass $250 million, said Box Office Mojo. Disney takes advantage of each hit by spinning it through its sprawling network of theme parks, TV studio and consumer products units. The movies sell well on DVD, and Disney will generate hefty revenue from sales of ""Captain America"" t-shirts, lunch boxes and action figures.The company is also making four original live-action TV series for Netflix that will begin streaming next year.""When you put the name Marvel on a movie, we think that it gives us essentially a head start with the audience,"" Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger told analysts during a conference call in February. ""Noah,"" starring Russell Crowe as the biblical figure, was second with $17 million in ticket sales from Friday to Sunday.The dystopian action film ""Divergent"" was third with $13 million, for a total of $114 million since its March 21 release in U.S. and Canadian theaters.""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" also scored the biggest opening weekend of 2014, and took in another $9.6 million at IMAX screenings, for which moviegoers a premium. That also set a new April record. ""I would certainly expect we can broaden out"" beyond the usual Marvel film buyers, said Dave Hollis, Walt Disney Studios' executive vice president of film distribution. Hollis noted that some 90 percent of critics gave positive notices as collated by the Rotten Tomatoes website and audiences rated the film an A.Fourth for the weekend, with sales of $7.7 million, was the independently released Christian drama ""God's Not Dead,"" which continued its impressive run despite being panned by critics.""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" rounded out the top five, taking in $6.3 million.

The trades took place the same month records show Scammell joined Madrone, an investment firm in Menlo Park, California, affiliated with Robson Walton, the chairman of Wal-Mart Stores Inc, and other members of the Walton family.A court filing by Scammell's lawyers earlier this month said Madrone fired Scammell in February 2010. A call to Madrone seeking comment was not immediately returned. Scammell faces a maximum of 25 years in prison, though under the plea agreement, prosecutors have agreed to recommend a term of no more than six months in prison followed by six months of home detention.Sentencing before U.S. District Judge James Otero is scheduled for July 28. A lawyer for Scammell did not respond to requests for comment.The case is U.S. v. Scammell, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 13-cr-00733.

It's a real-life story that warmed hearts over at the Walt Disney Co.By the standards of the studio known for big-budget blockbusters, ""Million Dollar Arm"" is a small film, with a budget of $25 million, a fraction of the $200 million it cost to make the soon-to-be-released ""Maleficent"" with Angelina Jolie. But it is in a league of Disney movies - along with last year's Disney history piece ""Saving Mr. Banks"" and the upcoming sports drama ""McFarland"" - that enhance the Disney brand with an uplifting, against-all-odds story.

After frustrating rounds of tryouts, the American agent finds two strong arms in Rinku and Dinesh in rural India and brings them to Southern California, where they undergo training before being shown to Major League Baseball scouts.  The young men find themselves struggling with the culture, the lifestyle and, most importantly, the business expectations that J.B. has for them. His neighbor Brenda, a doctor played by Lake Bell, works to suture the fraying relationship in time to save their chances of making it in American baseball.For the roles of the Indian pitchers, Disney chose Suraj Sharma, the actor stranded on a raft with the tiger in Ang Lee's ""Life of Pi,"" and Madhur Mittal, best known as Salim in the best picture Oscar winner ""Slumdog Millionaire"" - casting that might help widen the film's global appeal.Bell and Hamm, who are friends in real life, both highlighted one of the great advantages of working on a Disney film: for a change, they can send anyone in their families to see it and not have to worry about uncomfortable scenes.

The 35-year-old Bell wrote, directed and starred in her own independent movie ""In a World..."" in 2013, winning critical praise for her comic look into the rarefied world of voice over artists. ""It changed my life,"" she says of the experience.Now Bell stars opposite ""Mad Men"" star Jon Hamm in the Walt Disney Co feel-good sports drama ""Million Dollar Arm"" opening in U.S. theaters on Friday. She plays Brenda the neighbor and doctor who helps sports agent J.B. Bernstein in his improbable quest to train two baseball pitchers from India.Much to her disappointment, Bell didn't get to go to India to film. But she did get to talk to Reuters about what it's like to work in her first Disney film, how it is thankfully lacking in a ""weird boob scene,"" and what it's like working with Hamm (a question she clearly gets a lot these days).    Q: Is directing and starring in your own independent film and then going to a Disney movie quite a unique transition?A: It is. But I had a great experience. If anything it was refreshing to be in the hands of the very capable director Craig (Gillespie). And Disney, I have never worked for Disney before but it was a tremendous experience. And Jon is a really good friend of mine.As a writer-director, I like being on other people's sets. I am an actor first and foremost and I think being an actor for hire is how I learn, seeing other people's sets ... Especially with this movie having sports elements, I've never seen anything like that. Unfortunately, I didn't get to go to India.Q: You get to play the bridge between the young Indian men and the prototype- American sports agent.  A: I play the literal girl next door who is somewhat irrelevant initially and then becomes incredibly relevant in suturing that relationship between J.B. and Rinku and Dinesh.J.B. is kind of going down this straightaway of trying to find monetary gain from these investments he has brought back and he, with the help of my character, gets punched in the proverbial gut...'Hey check it out. This is so much more than monetary gain and the only way these boys will find success is if you respect that they are going through an emotional journey as well.'Q: What did you like about the character of Brenda?A: I enjoy Brenda's utter steadfast truth and her ability to express herself via tough love, which is something I relate to deeply in my own life. Q: It is such a cliche question, but millions of women would probably want to know what it's like playing opposite Jon Hamm. A: How do I answer that in a new way? Jon and I are good friends. We have known each other for a long time. He comes on (satirical TV series) 'Children's Hospital' occasionally as a recurring, so he is very playful and fun. He is really goofy and hilarious and people probably know that somewhat from his SNL career... But he really is a comedy fan and great comedy player.In this film, he plays the straight man to a lot of fish-out-of-water elements, which I think is incredibly difficult and takes a comedic brain to know how to play the straight man with perfection.Q: Some might say you are a knockout, but in your film and this film you play somewhat disheveled, messy women.  A: I really enjoy playing characters who are realistically put together, from ""In a World...,"" playing Carol, the character I wrote for myself to depict, to Brenda who lives her life in scrubs and sweatpants. I don't walk around in stilettos and fancy dress all the time. That's just not my life and I don't feel comfortable that way. I enjoy playing characters I can relate to personally who aren't 'glam squad' all the time. 'Glam squad' is fun sometimes, but I feel like I can breath a bit better in a character that speaks truth in her visual representation.Q: This might be your most high-profile role and a lot of people may get to know you with this role, right?A: It's interesting to think about it that way. Because it’s Disney, it's a very universally acceptable film for a lot of different demographics. This is the first time I am in a film I can say to any family member to go and check it out and I am not embarrassed by some weird boob scene or something. It's safe. It is incredibly sweet and it's relatable for young relatives, older relatives and everything in between. That, for me, is a big deal.

153,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 28 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to The Walt  Disney Company's (Disney) proposed offering of benchmark-sized three-, five-,  and 30-year senior unsecured notes.  The Rating Outlook is Stable. Approximately  $15.6 billion of debt was outstanding as of March 31, 2014. A full list of  ratings follows at the end of this release. Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of debt  and commercial paper (CP). Outstanding CP totaled $2.3 billion as of March 31,  2014.  The notes will be issued under Disney's existing indenture dated Sept.  24, 2001, and will be pari passu with all existing debt. Similar to existing  bonds, there are no financial covenants. KEY RATING DRIVERS --Fitch believes Disney has the financial flexibility and capacity at the  current rating level to accommodate a higher level of share repurchases during  its fiscal year 2014 in a manner neutral to its credit profile. --The ratings incorporate Fitch's expectation that the company's share  repurchase and M&A activity will likely exceed free cash flow (FCF) generation. --Disney is uniquely positioned to capitalize and monetize franchises and brands  across the company's various business segments and platforms, providing Disney  with a sustainable competitive advantage relative to its peers.  --Disney is well-positioned to address the secular threats and opportunities  presented by emerging alternative distribution platforms and continued audience  fragmentation across the media and entertainment landscape.  Disney's capital structure and credit protection metrics remain consistent and  within Fitch's expectations for the current rating. Consolidated leverage of  1.16x as of the LTM period ended March 31, 2014 is in line with fiscal year-end  2013 metrics. Going forward Fitch believes leverage will range between 1.2x and  1.4x during the ratings horizon after consideration of a modest increase in debt  levels related to the higher level of share repurchases. Fitch does not anticipate any meaningful changes to Disney's financial policy as  the company increases the level of share repurchases during fiscal 2014 to range  between $6 billion and $8 billion. Through May 6, 2014, Disney has repurchased  58.2million shares of its common stock for approximately $4.3billion.  As of  March 29, 2014, the company had authorization to repurchase 116 million  additional shares.  Given the strength of Disney's underlying businesses, strong  liquidity position, and Fitch's FCF expectations, Disney has the financial  flexibility to accommodate the higher level of share repurchases in a manner  consistent with its current ratings. Additionally, in Fitch's estimation the  company maintains an appropriate balance between returning capital to  shareholders, in the form of dividends and share repurchases, and investing in  the strategic needs of its business. Disney's operating profile positions it to generate meaningful levels of FCF  (defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and dividends),  providing the company with considerable financial flexibility at the current  ratings. Disney generated approximately $5.3 billion of FCF through the LTM  period ended March 31, 2014.  Disney's investment cycle within its Parks and  Resort segment is winding down, which will benefit the company's FCF generation.  Fitch anticipates that Disney will generate in excess of $4 billion of annual  FCF during the ratings horizon. Overall, the ratings reflect the company's leading market positions within its  core businesses. Further, Disney has a very consistent investment strategy that  is centered on creating or acquiring intellectual property and content that is  leverageable across Disney's various platforms (cable and broadcast network,  studio, parks and resorts, and consumer products). Disney is uniquely  positioned, relative to its peers to capitalize and monetize its internally or  externally developed franchises and brands, which in turn strengthens Disney's  operating and credit profile and provides the company with a sustainable  competitive advantage.  Disney's strong portfolio of cable networks underlines the company's ratings,  and its operating profile continues to benefit from the stable, recurring  dual-stream revenue profile and high operating margin characteristics  attributable to its cable network business. Disney's cable networks generate a  greater portion of total revenue and EBITDA, resulting in incremental stability  in the total revenue and FCF profile. Rising programming costs, particularly  sports programming, and Disney's ability to pass the higher costs along to  multi-channel video programming distributors (MPVDs) will remain a significant  risk to the company's operating profile. However, Fitch believes that Disney is  in a strong position to retain pricing power going forward as its collection of  top-tier cable networks continue to command audience and ratings and be a  must-carry for the MVPDs. In addition, Disney has in large part successfully  matched the tenor of its long-term sports programming rights with the terms of  its various affiliation agreements with the MVPDs.  Ratings incorporate the cyclicality of the company's businesses, particularly  Parks & Resorts (31% of Disney's year-to-date revenue), consumer products (8%),  and the advertising portion of broadcast and cable networks (19%). Should  macroeconomic volatility return, Fitch expects these cyclical businesses to be  under renewed pressure but that the company's credit and financial profile will  likely remain within expectations for the current ratings. The ratings  incorporate Fitch's expectation that the Studio Entertainment business, will  remain volatile and low margin, similar to that of its peers, given the  hit-driven nature. The decline of home entertainment sales, which is the window  in which many films become profitable, is becoming less of a concern amid the  growth of higher-margin digital distribution, and should be accommodated within  current ratings.  Disney is well-positioned to address the secular threats and opportunities  presented by emerging alternative distribution platforms and continued audience  fragmentation across the media and entertainment landscape. Fitch expects  alternative distribution platforms to generate incremental demand for  high-quality content across all major end-markets (broadcast, cable networks and  subscription video on demand) and large, well-capitalized content providers,  such as Disney, to remain crucial to the industry.  Disney's liquidity position and financial flexibility remain strong and are  supported by significant FCF generation as well as $6 billion of aggregate  available borrowing capacity (as of March 31, 2014) under three credit  facilities. Commitments under these facilities support the company's $6 billion  CP program and expire during March 2015 ($1.5 billion), June 2017 ($2.25  billion) and March 2019 ($2.25 billion). In addition, the company had  approximately $4.1 billion of cash on hand as of March 31, 2014. Scheduled  maturities (pro forma for the announced repayment of debt and CP) are  well-laddered and manageable considering FCF generation expectations and access  to capital markets.  Approximately $2.8 billion (including $2.3 billion of CP) of debt is scheduled  to mature during fiscal 2014 followed by approximately $2 billion annually  during fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016 (Fiscal year ends September). Fitch does not  expect debt reduction going forward.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Upward momentum to the ratings is unlikely over the intermediate term.  However, a compelling rationale for, and an explicit public commitment to, more  conservative leverage thresholds could result in upgrade consideration.  Negative: Negative rating actions are more likely to coincide with discretional  actions of Disney's management rather than by operating performance, reflecting  the company's significant financial flexibility. Decisions that increase  leverage beyond 1.75x in the absence of a credible plan to reduce leverage will  likely lead to a negative rating action. Total debt at March 31, 2014 was $15.6 billion and consisted of: --$2.3 billion of CP; --$12.2 billion of notes and debentures, with maturities ranging from December  2014 - 2093; --$256 million of debt related to Hong Kong Disneyland, which is non-recourse  back to Disney but which Fitch consolidates under the assumption that the  company would back the loan payments;  --$554 million of foreign currency-denominated debt; --$318 million of other debt. Fitch currently rates Disney as follows: The Walt Disney Company --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper at 'F1'. ABC Inc. --IDR at 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A'. Disney Enterprises, Inc. --IDR at 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A'. Fitch links the IDRs of the issuing entities (predominantly based on the lack of  any material restrictions on movements of cash between the entities) and treats  the unsecured debt of the entire company as pari passu. Fitch recognizes the  absence of upstream guarantees from the operating assets and that debt at Disney  Enterprises is structurally senior to the holding company debt. However, Fitch  does not distinguish the issue ratings at the two entities due to the strong 'A'  category investment-grade IDR, Fitch's expectations of stable financial  policies, and the anticipation that future debt will be issued by Walt Disney  Company. Fitch would consider distinguishing between the ratings if it appeared  there was heightened risk of the company's IDR falling to non-investment grade  (where Disney Enterprises' enhanced recovery prospects would be more relevant).

163,"   By Lisa Richwine and Malathi Nayak | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Walt Disney Co expects revenue from its 10-month-old Infinity video game to reach $1 billion even as rivals also combine physical toys with video games, Jimmy Pitaro, president of the company's interactive unit, said in an interview.Disney launched Infinity in August to help turn around its interactive gaming unit, which lost $1.4 billion from fiscal year 2008 to 2013. In an overhaul in March, the division laid off about one-quarter of the workforce, cut the number of games it develops and focused its advertising more on the fast-changing mobile market.A month ago, Disney reported global revenue of $550 million for Infinity. Sales of the game helped the interactive unit post a $14 million profit for the quarter that ended in March, its third consecutive quarterly profit.""We will be a billion-dollar franchise,"" Pitaro said of Infinity in an interview on Wednesday at the E3 video game conference. He declined to provide a time frame.A Disney spokeswoman said Pitaro's projection was ""just the beginning of what we expect it to do. This is a long-term game franchise with enormous revenue potential."" Infinity lets users play with characters from Disney and Pixar films such as Anna and Elsa from ""Frozen,"" Captain Jack Sparrow from ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and Lightning McQueen from ""Cars."" The company is launching the next version of the game, ""Disney Infinity 2.0: Marvel Super Heroes"" in the fall, bringing in Captain America, Iron Man, Spider-Man and others.  Infinity competes with Activision Blizzard Inc's ""Skylanders"" franchise that first successfully introduced the concept of toys coming to life on screen when placed on an electronic base.    Since its launch in October 2011 until the end of 2013, ""Skylanders"" has surpassed $2 billion in revenue.This week at E3, Nintendo Co Ltd announced it would release ""amiibo"" toys of characters such as Mario with a chip that activates them in games when placed on the GamePad controller of its Wii U console.Disney also plans more mobile ""Star Wars"" games before its scheduled December 2015 release of the seventh movie in the classic sci-fi series, Pitaro said. Disney also has a multi-year licensing deal with Electronic Arts Inc to develop a different line of ""Star Wars"" games.

168,"   By Ronald Grover  and Liana B. Baker  Univision Communications has had several informal sale talks in the past year, but the company's board could take a year or longer to decide on a potential deal, as the company seeks to boost profits and pay down debt, people familiar with the matter said. Owners of the Spanish-language U.S. media company think it could fetch more by further improving its earnings ahead of an initial public offering or sale in 2015, according to three people familiar with the board's thinking.Univision's reluctance to commit to a formal sale process at this stage highlights the challenges that the company's potential suitors face in winning what is widely considered to be one of the media industry's most highly coveted businesses. The company held preliminary talks with CBS Corp (CBS.N) and Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) earlier this year, but those talks were preliminary in nature, the people said.  The board, including members who represent private equity firms that bought Univision for $12.3 billion in 2007, could still decide to sell if Univision fetches an offer that is too good to turn down, said one of the people.For now Univision is focused on paying down its $9.2 billion in debt through its rising cash flow, that person added. New York-based Univision was taken private by a group of buyout firms including Haim Saban's Saban Capital Group, Madison Dearborn Partners, Providence Equity Partners, TPG Capital and Thomas H. Lee Partners.Mexican media company Televisa owns an 8 percent stake in Univision and has bought debt that could be converted into a stake of up to 30 percent. It holds three board seats and also collects hundreds of millions in licensing revenue and royalties every year from Univision which airs a large chunk of its programing. ""It is unclear if Televisa would be willing to divest its stake or even acquire the remainder of the company at this juncture,"" Barclays analyst Danish Agboatwala said.  A representative for Televisa declined to comment on its plans. Univision reduced its debt by nearly $130 million in the first quarter ended March 31, its most recent quarter, compared to a year ago, according to a financial statement on its website. Net cash flow from operations more than tripled, to $77.8 million in the quarter that ended March 31, as the company enjoyed higher ratings at its UniMas broadcast network and Univision Deportes Network cable sports channel. Representatives for CBS and Time Warner Inc declined to comment. Univision spokeswoman Monica Talan said the company does not comment on rumors. The talks underscore the consolidation sweeping the telecoms, cable and satellite TV industry, which is being shaken up by Comcast Corp's (CMCSA.O) proposed $45 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N and AT&T's (T.N) agreement to buy satellite TV provider DirecTV DTV.O.Walt Disney Co is another media company that could be interested in Univision, analysts said.

[ID:nL2N0OY1P5] The game also attracted 6.5 million viewers for Spanish language broadcaster Univision [UVN.UL], making it the most viewed U.S. World Cup match in the network's history, and beating last Monday's U.S.-Ghana game which garnered 4.8 million viewers.On Sunday, the U.S. team had nearly secured a come-from-behind victory with goals from Jermaine Jones and Clint Dempsey, until Portugal substitute Silvestre Varela scored with a flying header from a Cristiano Ronaldo cross. [ID: nL6N0P400P] The next match for the United States vs. Germany will air Thursday at 11:30 am Eastern on ESPN.While soccer is on the upswing in the United States, it still lacks the television audience numbers of some other sports.

171,"   By David Randall | NEW YORK, June 26  NEW YORK, June 26 Fund managers are making a big bet on Snoopy, Lucy and Charlie Brown.With a big-budget Peanuts film set to appear in theaters next year, an unusually high number of U.S. mutual funds have been buying shares of Iconix Brand Group Inc, the little-known company that owns 80 percent of the rights to the characters. The number of new funds owning shares swelled 36 percent last quarter, according to data from fund tracker Morningstar. That is a high number for a company with a market value of $1.9 billion and a slowing core business, fund experts say.Few consumers have ever heard of the New York-based company, though they are likely familiar with its roster of 35 brands, ranging from mass-market staples like Joe Boxer and Ed Hardy to Cannon linens and Material Girl, the line of apparel and accessories from Madonna and her daughter. But with many of its U.S. retail partners, such as Target, Macy's and Sears Holdings Corp, struggling with falling traffic and weak consumer demand, Iconix is looking elsewhere to expand.""With what is happening in America we don't see large growth there over the next couple of years but we do see stability,"" Chief Executive Neil Cole, the brother of fashion designer Kenneth Cole, told analysts after the company reported its quarterly results in April.PEANUTS BRAND Should the Peanuts movie prove to be a hit, it could help Iconix double its revenues, which hit $433 million in 2013, Cole told analysts. The company declined to comment for this story.Already, the brand has paid some dividends: Walt Disney Co's  ABC network renewed its long-standing contract to air the popular Peanuts holiday specials 18 months before it came due. Iconix recognized $17 million of the $21 million contract in the first quarter, which helped push revenue up 11 percent to $116.1 million and non-diluted adjusted earnings per share to 72 cents, a 33 percent increase from the same time last year. There is no telling how well the movie will be received, of course. For every hit like ""The Lego Movie,"" which has brought in $256.7 million at the U.S. box office, according to Box Office Mojo, there has been a film like 2013's ""The Lone Ranger,"" whose $89 million in U.S. box-office take paled against an estimated cost of $215 million.Though the percentage that Iconix could reap from next year's film was not disclosed, the Peanuts brand should command a premium, said Charles W. Grimes, a Norwalk, Connecticut, attorney who specializes in character licensing and has worked with properties including Archie comics and Disney characters. It would ""not be inconceivable"" for the company to get an upfront fee of $10 million or more for the theatrical release of the film, plus additional fees once the box office draw topped certain milestones, Grimes said.Iconix would also likely get between 7 and 14 percent of film merchandise tie-ins, such as T-shirts or toys, he said.Sesame Street Workshop, the non-profit company that owns the license to Elmo and the other Sesame Street characters, made $46.5 million from licensing in the year that ended June 30, 2013, according to its most recent financial statement. ""Peanuts has a huge growth ahead of it,"" said Cliff Greenberg, who manages $5.5 billion in the Baron Small Cap fund  and has been buying shares of Iconix on dips in expectations that it will continue to expand its entertainment division.Chris Terry, an analyst at Dallas-based Hodges Capital, said his firm began buying shares approximately six months ago on expectations that the Peanuts license will pay off.RISKS AHEAD There is caution, however, in some quarters. The lack of clear numbers regarding Peanut's contribution gives Steve Marotta, an analyst at C.L. King & Associates who covers the stock, pause.""The company is a bit of black box,"" he said. He estimates that Peanuts is the most important individual brand to the company, followed by Mossimo and Candie's.Nevertheless, he has a ""buy"" rating on the stock, and a target price of $47, slightly above the median target price of $46.50 among analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters.Shares closed at $42.71 Wednesday, and trade at a forward price to earnings multiple of 15.3, a full point lower than the 16.7 average among apparel companies.The company now largely depends on overseas licenses for growth and has several joint ventures to sell its brands throughout Asia, Marotta said.Eric Beder, an analyst at Brean Capital, said he has a ""hold"" rating because Iconix has not bought any new brands this year after typically adding two or three annually.""The company doesn't usually beat by much and usually never misses,"" he said. ""But right now it's a question of finding the right deals and that isn't happening.""

174,"  NEW YORK, July 9 Cartoon characters like Mickey Mouse and Spider-man have been adored by generations of children, but their costumed counterparts who roam New York City's Times Square are more a public nuisance, New York City lawmakers said on Wednesday.Indeed, tighter restrictions are likely ahead for the people who don the oversized costumes and pose for pictures with tourists for a fee, City Council members said at a meeting of the Times Square Alliance.The unlicensed workers, who are under scrutiny in the wake of unsavory incidents with tourists, can be very aggressive, said Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer.""They accost people,"" she said. ""They ask to take a picture. They ask for money. They chase people to the ATM sometimes for money.""Last month, a worker dressed as Spider-Man was fined $370 for punching a tourist who had pelted him with snow. Last year, a costumed Cookie Monster was arrested for shoving a 2-year-old child whose mother failed to tip him, and in 2012, a man dressed as Elmo was arrested for an anti-Semitic tirade.The council is likely to put forward legislation to regulate the characters but would protect their right to artistic expression, Brewer said. City lawmakers have said that dressing up in a costume in Times Square could be protected under the constitutional right to freedom of speech.Last year, legislation to regulate the characters, including licensing requirements, failed to pass the City Council. Brewer said that companies such as the Walt Disney Co , which holds the trademark for Mickey and Minnie Mouse,  and Japan's Sanrio Co which holds the trademark for Hello Kitty, could take legal action.Lawmakers at the meeting said the number of characters has proliferated.

180,"   By Ronald Grover  and Diane Bartz  Twenty-First Century Fox's plan to buy Time Warner could create an upheaval in the sports television world, creating the first meaningful challenge to Walt Disney Co's ESPN.Time Warner's board has rejected an $80 billion bid, but Fox Chairman Rupert Murdoch is unlikely to walk away quickly. A deal would bring him college basketball's ""March Madness"" championship tournament, prime time National Basketball Association (NBA) games, and Major League Baseball (MLB) games.Fox's sports rights include National Football League games, professional baseball games and NASCAR racing. In 2015 it gets the rights to women's World Cup soccer and in 2018 the men's World Cup.Disney's ESPN, with Monday Night Football, Major League Baseball games, NBA games and college football, will still be the team to beat, but for once there might be a match. ""You start to put it all together and you create a significant competitor to ESPN for ratings and advertising dollars,” said Marc Ganis, a sports TV consultant. In an age of DVRs and on demand viewing, sports stands out for its ability to draw television audiences which are large and watch live, two traits crucial for selling advertising, says Ed Desser, a former president of NBA Television and New Media Ventures, who advises teams and league's on their TV contracts.""It's TV's growth engine,"" he says. ""It drives subscriber fees and keeps people watching.""Ganis speculates that some key Time Warner sports, such as its professional basketball doubleheaders, could move from TNT to Fox Sports 1. Fox Sports 1 already airs major league baseball, motor sports, mixed marital arts and college football and basketball games from the larger conferences. The additions could allow Fox Sports 1, now in about 90 million homes, to add subscribers and raise the affiliate fees from cable and satellite operators that make up the majority of its revenues.ESPN is in more than 100 million homes, not too far ahead of Fox.However, ESPN currently can charge cable companies $6.04 per month for each subscriber, according to data compiled by consultant SNL Kagan. By comparison, Fox Sports 1 is paid 68 cents for each of its subscribers. Thanks in part to its National Basketball Association games, TNT gets $1.48 per subscriber.  SPREADING THE COSTS Murdoch could also use Time Warner's collection of channels to outbid competitors for key sporting events, spreading the costs among its Fox network and cable channels, said Derek Baine, Research Director at SNL Kagan.""One of the things driving this deal is that Fox will be more aggressively bidding on sports rights, so this will give them more fire power,"" Baine said in an email. ""Like NBCU with the Olympics, they can spread games across multiple networks."" Combining the two would also eliminate a major buyer of sports programming, which may raise concerns at the U.S. Justice Department when it reviews a deal, said Peter Carstensen, who teaches antitrust at the University of Wisconsin Law School.Carstensen says the review may focus on specific parts of the content business -- movies, sports, news -- rather than a new company's entire offering of content.""My guess is that enforcers are less likely to be concerned by the overall programming,"" he said. ""If you're not going to take the general market view, you may have to divest some sports programming.""Fox also will have to convince sports leagues or conferences to alter existing contracts to shift around the sports, said Desser. Contracts usually tightly prescribe where games can be shown, and leagues are loath to change them for fear of upsetting other TV rights holders.Fox already airs NBA games on many of its 22 regional sports cable channels, he says.""But anything is possible, and deals get rewritten,"" he said. ""Sports are such a pure growth engine that they may try.""

Low-budget horror film ""The Purge: Anarchy"" finished in second place with $28.4 million.Another new big release, Walt Disney Co's animated ""Planes: Fire and Rescue,"" grabbed third place with $18 million,  while the comedy ""Sex Tape"" took in $15 million for the No. 4 spot. ""Apes,"" a sequel to the 2011 franchise reboot ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes,"" has rung up some $242 million worldwide since its July 11 debut, according to distributor 20th Century Fox, a unit of Twenty-First Century Fox. The movie stars Andy Serkis as Caesar, a brainy ape who leads the interactions with humans in the battle for dominance.""The Purge: Anarchy,"" a follow-up to 2013 summer hit ""The Purge,"" tells the story of a couple whose car breaks down at the start of an annual purge, a 12-hour period in which crime is legal. Produced for $9 million, it ranks as another successful, inexpensive movie produced by horror filmmaker Jason Blum.""This is going to be a super-profitable film for the studio,"" said Nikki Rocco, president for domestic distribution at Universal Pictures, the Comcast Corp unit that released the film. Noting that ""the market has been depressed for these kinds of films,"" Rocco added that the solid $28 million opening ""was better than we would have hoped for.""The $50 million ""Planes: Fire and Rescue,"" another sequel, features the voice of U.S. comedian and actor Dane Cook as a crop dusting plane that joins forces with a team of rescue vehicles to fight a wildfire, and follows last summer's ""Planes,"" a spinoff of Disney's blockbuster ""Cars"" films. ""Sex Tape"" stars Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel as a married couple who accidentally upload a racy video of themselves onto the Internet. The movie cost about $40 million, according to Sony Corp's movie studio, which distributed it.""We hoped for a bit more domestically,"" said Rory Bruer, president of worldwide distribution at Sony, referring to the opening.""But at the end of the day we'll be profitable,"" he added, noting that, internationally, the film looked to be doing business on par with the earlier Diaz comedy hit, ""Bad Teacher.""Rounding out the top five, the summer hit ""Transformers: Age of Extinction,"" starring Mark Wahlberg and a cast of form-changing robots, grossed $10 million for a U.S. total of $227 million.

182,"  (For more Reuters DEALTALKS, double click on )By Liana B. Baker, Jennifer Saba and Soyoung KimNEW YORK, July 25 If Twenty-First Century Fox  succeeds in buying Time Warner Inc, it's likely to sell CNN and pay billions of dollars in taxes rather than go through the headaches of spinning the cable news channel off to shareholders of the merged company, according to people familiar with the matter.Fox plans to get rid of CNN because it already operates its own namesake news network and would likely face opposition from regulators even if it wanted to keep it. Potential buyers include CBS and Walt Disney's ABC - two broadcast news juggernauts in search of a cable news outlet.A sale would mean a tax hit of about 40 percent of the proceeds, which could range between $6 billion and $10 billion, according to tax experts and industry analysts. The entire sale price would be taxable because CNN is carried on Time Warner's books at near-zero, people familiar with the company said.""That's an additional cost to the deal and that tax liability is going to reduce the amount they are able to pay to Time Warner shareholders,"" said corporate tax and accounting analyst Robert Willens, referring to Fox. The 40 percent figure comes from a combination of federal, state and local taxes, Willens said.Fox isn't considering spinning off CNN, a structure that's popular with media companies when there is a dearth of buyers, according to people familiar with the matter. Time Warner recently cleaved off its magazine division Time Inc as a standalone public company after a possible merger with Meredith Corp fell through. Tribune Co also plans to spin off its newspaper assets from its faster-growing broadcast division next month.Fox would likely face tax consequences in a spin-off as well, a person familiar with the situation said.CNN would have difficulties as a standalone company because, unwound from a cable bundle, it would likely see its subscriber fees plummet, according to people familiar with the matter. CNN makes money from advertising sales and by charging cable companies to carry the channel.It's currently packaged with other Turner channels such as TBS and TNT. The average price cable operators pay CNN has been steadily climbing from 50 cents per subscriber per month in 2009 to 63 cents in 2014, according to estimates from SNL Kagan. Fox itself estimates that CNN would fetch about $6 billion to $7 billion in a sale, according to a person familiar with the matter. That would represent a low double-digit multiple of CNN's estimated annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of roughly $500 million, the person added.At those prices, Rupert Murdoch's media colossus would still reap about $3.5 billion to $5 billion after paying the tax bill.Many media assets have a low tax basis, and in CNN's case, its value has increased dramatically from when it was first acquired. In these cases, the seller is taxed on the proceeds of the gains in value.Time Warner got CNN as part of its $7.5 billion acquisition of Turner Broadcasting in 1996, a deal that included the Cartoon Network, the Atlanta Braves baseball team and other properties. Founded in 1980 by media mogul Ted Turner, CNN was the first cable news network in the United States and now has more than 40 news bureaus across the globe, with distribution in more than 200 countries.Representatives from Time Warner and Fox declined to comment.DISCIPLINE The idea to divest CNN was part of Fox's offer that Time Warner rebuffed worth $85 per share in a mix of cash and stock, which both companies disclosed on July 16. Sources told Reuters last week that Time Warner's board was concerned about the structure of the deal because the stock that Fox had on the table was only common shares, not the special class of voting stock that gives Murdoch control.To make a deal more appealing to Time Warner's board, Fox will have to come up with a significantly higher amount of cash, people familiar with Time Warner have suggested.While it remains to be seen how much more Murdoch is willing to put on the table eventually, one person said Fox currently is not considering a bid above the $90 to $95 per share range.The relatively high tax hit on CNN may play into that calculus, because it would force Murdoch to look elsewhere for additional funds for any premium.On Friday, Fox announced a deal to sell its European pay-TV assets in Germany and Italy to BSkyB in a deal worth $9 billion. Fox holds a 39 percent stake in British pay-TV channel BSkyB in a deal that will net Fox after-tax proceeds of around $7.2 billion.Some of the cash proceeds could be used to support a potential higher bid for Time Warner, but Fox plans to be prudent in its pursuit and will likely use part of the money toward buying back shares, people familiar with the matter said.Moody's analyst Neil Begley said he sees Fox as having enough financial flexibility to pay down debt over time, which could help it pursue a higher bid without sacrificing the company's investment grade credit rating.""Mr. Murdoch is a smart guy. I'd be very surprised if he's suddenly willing to bet the farm here,"" Begley said.        (Reporting by Liana B. Baker, Soyoung Kim and Jennifer Saba in New York.

""Guardians,"" the newest franchise from the Disney-owned Marvel universe, follows a rogue band of misfits on an intergalactic space adventure.As the Guardians try to save the galaxy from a planet-destroying orb coveted by evil warlords, they may also ""save the summer"" for a slumping movie industry if the film exceeds expectations, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Rentrak.""This is a movie that everyone has been waiting for,"" Dergarabedian said.

Early projections for the ""Guardians"" opening weekend at the U.S. and Canadian box office were estimated to reach between $65 million to $80 million. Dergarabedian said the movie could beat those forecasts especially if Saturday's attendance holds strong.

185,"  ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" Walt Disney Co's offbeat space adventure featuring extraterrestrial misfits and a talking raccoon, made $94 million in ticket sales this weekend, setting a record for an August film opening.The film's strong beginning, however, isn't likely to jumpstart a lackluster summer box office season.    The 3D movie, which stars lesser-known characters in Disney's Marvel comic book universe, added $66.4 million from international markets, for a global debut of $160.4 million, Disney said on Sunday.     ""Guardians"" outgunned last weekend's leader, the science-fiction thriller ""Lucy"" that collected another $18.3 million in sales at domestic theaters, according to estimates from Rentrak.""Lucy"" stars Scarlett Johansson as a woman with a super-powered brain.     ""Get On Up,"" a biography of the soul singer James Brown, was third with $14 million in its first weekend in theaters.       ""Guardians"" stars an ensemble cast that includes Zoe Saldana, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper and Chris Pratt. After  positive reviews, the film was the year's biggest Thursday night opening with $11.2 million in sales starting with 7 p.m. shows.    Even before the film's opening, Walt Disney said it was planning a sequel for release in July 2017.     Head of distribution for Walt Disney Studios Dave Hollis attributed the strong performance of ""Guardians"" to a combination of momentum started by ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" in June, skillful marketing, and strong reviews.    ""It starts with a great movie, and certainly the marketing was inspired,"" Hollis said.    Disney had marketed the film's lighter moments in trailers and commercials, including a machinegun-firing raccoon, to expand its popularity beyond traditional Marvel movie fans. The movie features a soundtrack of music from the 1970s, including the songs ""Hooked on a Feeling"" and ""Spirit in the Sky.""     ""Transformers: Age of Extinction,"" just passed $1 billion in global box office returns, according to Paramount Pictures.    ""Guardians"" performance, which beat Hollywood forecasts of a $65 million to $80 million opening, are not likely to energize the summer box office, however, as ticket sales are currently running 18 percent behind last year, according to Rentrak.    ""It doesn't end it but it's certainly a step in the right direction,"" said Rentrak's senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian about the slump.     It only gave the overall summer box office a two percent lift, he said.     ""Hercules,"" starring Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as the legendary muscle man, was fourth for the weekend with $10.7 million.     ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" was fifth with $8.7 million. The film has totaled more than $189.3 million in sales in U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Rentrak.    ""Lucy"" and ""Get On Up"" were released by Universal, a unit of Comcast Corp.

187,"   By Lisa Richwine  Media company Walt Disney Co's (DIS.N) quarterly profit blew past Wall Street expectations, with a muscular performance from its ""Captain America"" movie, higher attendance at U.S. theme parks and brisk sales of merchandise tied to mega-hit ""Frozen.""Net income rose to $2.2 billion in the quarter ended on June 28, up 22 percent from the year-ago period, the company said on Tuesday. Diluted earnings per share reached a record $1.28, beating analysts' average forecast of $1.17 in a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S survey.Revenue rose to 8 percent $12.47 billion.Shares of Disney rose 15 cents in after-hours trading to $86.90 after closing at $86.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger said the company's earnings per share for the first three quarters of fiscal 2014 were  greater than any previous full fiscal year.""Our strategy of building strong brands and franchises continues to create great value across our company,"" Iger said in a statement. Operating income at Disney's media networks division was flat at $2.3 billion and declined 7 percent for the unit's cable networks segment, due to a decrease at sports juggernaut ESPN. ESPN fell in part from higher programming and production costs for Major League Baseball and the FIFA World Cup, and the absence of ESPN UK, which had been sold, Disney said.At the movie studio, operating income more than doubled to $411 million, thanks to the success of ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" and ""Maleficent"" in theaters and home entertainment sales for ""Frozen."" The theme parks unit reported operating income of $848 million, up 23 percent from the prior year and driven by the company's U.S. operations. Both attendance and guest spending rose at domestic parks. The company is drawing up plans to add a ""far greater 'Star Wars' presence"" at its theme parks, Iger said, and hopes to announce details next year. He assured analysts the next ""Star Wars"" movie, ""Episode VII,"" remains set for release on December 18, 2015, despite an injury to star Harrison Ford.    Operating income for consumer products rose 25 percent to $273 million thanks to increases at Disney retail stores and in its licensing business for products related to ""Frozen,"" the Disney Channel, ""Spider-Man"" and ""Planes.""Disney's interactive gaming unit reported its fourth consecutive quarterly profit with help from sales of its Disney Infinity toy-and-game combo.

188,"  (Adds CEO comments from conference call)By Lisa RichwineAug 5 Media company Walt Disney Co's  quarterly profit blew past Wall Street expectations, with a muscular performance from its ""Captain America"" movie, higher attendance at U.S. theme parks and brisk sales of merchandise tied to mega-hit ""Frozen.""Net income rose to $2.2 billion in the quarter ended on June 28, up 22 percent from the year-ago period, the company said on Tuesday. Diluted earnings per share reached a record $1.28, beating analysts' average forecast of $1.17 in a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S survey.Revenue rose to 8 percent $12.47 billion.Shares of Disney rose 15 cents in after-hours trading to $86.90 after closing at $86.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger said the company's earnings per share for the first three quarters of fiscal 2014 were  greater than any previous full fiscal year. ""Our strategy of building strong brands and franchises continues to create great value across our company,"" Iger said in a statement.Operating income at Disney's media networks division was flat at $2.3 billion and declined 7 percent for the unit's cable networks segment, due to a decrease at sports juggernaut ESPN. ESPN fell in part from higher programming and production costs for Major League Baseball and the FIFA World Cup, and the absence of ESPN UK, which had been sold, Disney said.At the movie studio, operating income more than doubled to $411 million, thanks to the success of ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" and ""Maleficent"" in theaters and home entertainment sales for ""Frozen."" The theme parks unit reported operating income of $848 million, up 23 percent from the prior year and driven by the company's U.S. operations. Both attendance and guest spending rose at domestic parks.The company is drawing up plans to add a ""far greater 'Star Wars' presence"" at its theme parks, Iger said, and hopes to announce details next year. He assured analysts the next ""Star Wars"" movie, ""Episode VII,"" remains set for release on December 18, 2015, despite an injury to star Harrison Ford.Operating income for consumer products rose 25 percent to $273 million thanks to increases at Disney retail stores and in its licensing business for products related to ""Frozen,"" the Disney Channel, ""Spider-Man"" and ""Planes."" Disney's interactive gaming unit reported its fourth consecutive quarterly profit with help from sales of its Disney Infinity toy-and-game combo.

191,"   By Lisa Richwine and Ronald Grover  Shoppers entering a Walt Disney Co retail store these days can see company CEO Bob Iger's franchise strategy on display: walls packed with products linked to the company's famous characters, ranging from Mickey and Minnie to ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" Iron Man and Doc McStuffins.Ten years after being sold off and six years after Disney bought them back, Disney's 336 retail stores have helped make its consumer products division among the fastest-growing of the media company's five segments. In the quarter that ended in June, the unit earned $273 million, a 25 percent increase from a year ago. It was the unit's fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth, Iger said when the company announced its results on Tuesday.Iger's franchise strategy focuses on making larger-budget films like ""Maleficent"" that stand out in a crowd. Three years ago, he dispatched Bob Chapek, a veteran of the movie studio, to run the consumer products division, where he's done much the same thing. Chapek organized the unit around franchises, rather than categories such as footwear or lunch boxes. ""Consumers know that their children love a specific Disney franchise, whether it be Doc McStuffins, Frozen, or Minnie Mouse,"" Chapek said. Parents think ""I want to buy Doc McStuffins,"" he said, before considering the type of product. Iger's franchise strategy is the reason that over the past eight years the company paid $15 billion to buy Pixar, Marvel and George Lucas' Lucasfilm ""Star Wars"" factory. Iger directed the company's movie studio to focus on fewer films built around franchises.Part of Chapek's work at consumer products, which operates the Disney stores and licenses characters, is building on existing franchises.The company worked with licensee Hasbro to create 12-inch-tall Titan Heroes, from its ""Avengers"" line of figures, after research by Hasbro in Latin America showed customers wanted bigger toys. ""People who wouldn't otherwise be buying into the action figure category are now buying,"" Hasbro Chief Executive Brian Goldner said. The consumer products unit will be Disney's fastest-growing segment over the next five years, said Bernstein Research analyst Todd Juenger, who predicts earnings will grow at 13 percent compounded annual growth rate through fiscal 2018.New ideas from consumer-product staff include international dolls from Disney's ""It's a Small World"" ride and selling furry Tsum Tsum characters from a Disney video game.Chapek's strategy involves some risk-taking, said Stephen Berman, chief executive of Disney licensee Jakks Pacific. For Doc McStuffins, toys were in the market four months after the TV premiere, rather than waiting the typical 18 months to see if it was a hit. The bet was right on.  Sales of Doc McStuffins toys helped retail sales for the Disney Junior preschool business double to $1.9 billion in fiscal 2013.""He's taking a risk, but it's a calculated risk,"" Berman said. ""Who could have figured McStuffins would be as big as it's become?""The unit also is creating new franchises from book publishing. In May, it released the first in the ""Deep Blue"" mermaid series along with a song and music videos. In January it will launch ""The Zodiac Legacy"" thriller series from Marvel Comics creator Stan Lee.Not every Disney product is a mega-hit in toyland. Sales of products related to 2011 film ""Cars 2"" were big, but not as high as licensees expected, said Needham & Co analyst Sean McGowan. While its wide range of hot-selling toys is impressive, ""not all of them work that well,"" he said.

193,"  Aug 7 A 29-year-old San Francisco man was sentenced to three months in federal prison on Thursday after he pleaded guilty to insider trading ahead of news that Marvel Entertainment Inc would be bought by Walt Disney Co.Toby Scammell, a former associate at California investment firm, Madrone Capital Partners, admitted in April to illegally making $192,000 in August 2009 by purchasing stock options to buy Marvel stock just before Marvel's acquisition by Disney, where his girlfriend was working.In addition to the prison sentence, U.S. District Judge James Otero in Los Angeles ordered Scammell to pay restitution of about $122,494 to the victim broker-dealers.Scammell earlier had been ordered to pay civil penalties and interest of $800,985 in a civil action filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Scammell admitted that he had learned that Disney planned to acquire a company ""that people would recognize right away"" from his then-girlfriend, who was working as an extern at Disney in the summer of 2009. Later, Scammell learned from a supervisor at his then-employer that Disney had earlier been interested in acquiring Marvel. Scammell used the information to acquire 659 call options to purchase Marvel stock for $5,465, according to prosecutors.Immediately after Disney's public announcement of the deal, Scammell sold his options, realizing more than $192,000 in profits. Scammell's attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.The case is U.S. v. Scammell, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 13-cr-00733.

Disney does not perform strategic alliances with just anyone, and we are very proud to be associated with Disney,"" Leighton told Reuters.The Disney agreement gives Pandora access to its popular resorts and extends the company's footprint in the United States - a core growth market for the company, according to analysts. Pandora's second-quarter revenue was 2.5 billion Danish Crowns ($447.8 million) and the Americas led the way with 1.097 billion out of the total, followed by Europe on 1.064 billion.While revenue in Europe jumped 65 percent from a year earlier, it only increased five percent in the Americas.""Disney is definitely an opportunity to drive some more revenue in the U.S., and we are doing it to increase our sales,"" Leighton said, adding he hoped to see the impact on next year's revenue, without being able to elaborate on the range.

It is available exclusively for 30 days through Apple Inc's App Store and later on Google Inc's Android devices. Disney generates revenue by selling a currency known as crystals that can be used to speed up game play.On Sept. 29, the company will release computer-animated movie ""Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion"" online and on the Watch Disney XD app. The film debuts on Disney Channels around the world on Oct. 3, followed by a series based on the movie on the Disney XD channel starting Oct. 13.  This week, retailers began selling toys, bedding, backpacks and other products tied to the series, expanding the range of ""Star Wars"" items previously available.

The game will be promoted on Disney's StarWars.com website, which is drawing steady traffic from fans more than a year before the next film, ""Episode VII,"" hits theaters, said Jimmy Pitaro, president of Disney's interactive unit. ""We are still a decent amount of time from the movie, and yet we are seeing a huge amount of interest,"" Pitaro said.

""We are still a decent amount of time from the movie, and yet we are seeing a huge amount of interest,"" Pitaro said.It remains to be seen if ""Star Wars"" will be as much a draw as a couple decades ago. But the campaign is representative of Disney's strategy of banking on acquired names. This year, retailers generated $1 billion in sales from each of eight Disney's franchises, including Marvel's Spider-Man and Pixar movie ""Cars,"" Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger has said.The company says will release a film annually starting with  ""Episode VII."" It also plans to ""significantly"" increase the space adventure's presence at its theme parks, Iger said during an Aug. 5 earnings call.Although Iger didn't disclose how the company intends to use ""Star Wars"" at its parks, in 2012 it tapped another franchise when it opened a 12-acre Cars Land, based on the 2006 Pixar film, at Disney California Adventure park in Anaheim.""This is one of those franchises you just can't overexpose,"" said Peter Sealey, former head of marketing at Columbia Pictures.

203,"  (Adds details of show, reviews)By Piya Sinha-RoyLOS ANGELES Aug 26 After moving up a month and switching to a weekday evening, Monday's Primetime Emmy awards drew 15.6 million viewers, a drop from last year's Sunday night show despite a new host, a passionate kiss and a touching tribute.This year's Emmy awards, which saw AMC's drug drama ""Breaking Bad"" and ABC's hit ""Modern Family"" take home the top awards in drama and comedy, drew the second-highest viewership in the past eight years, NBC said on Tuesday, citing Nielsen ratings figures.The show, which was also moved a month earlier to August, drew 5.3 million viewers in the 18-to-49 demographic coveted by advertisers. On social media, Emmys were a top trending topic on Twitter throughout the telecast, while 6.2 million people discussed the show on Facebook.Key moments from the night included ""Veep"" winner Julia Louis-Dreyfus locking lips with Bryan Cranston for a passionate kiss as a throwback to their ""Seinfeld"" days as she went up to collect her best comedy actress award, and an audience question-and-answer session with Melissa McCarthy asking whether her illegally parked car would get towed.The show also featured Billy Crystal's touching and funny tribute to the late Robin Williams. Comcast Corp's NBC said the Emmys telecast beat rival broadcast networks in the 8 p.m.-to-11 p.m. time period, with CBS Corp's CBS, Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's  FOX and Walt Disney Co's ABC drawing a combined total of 13.8 million viewers on Monday.Last year's show, which took place on a Sunday in September and was hosted by Neil Patrick Harris on CBS, drew 17.6 million viewers. Critics this year picked on the complicated awards show categories, which saw some confusing entries such as HBO's ""True Detective"" in best drama rather than miniseries, and Netflix's ""Orange Is the New Black"" drama about a women's prison submitted in the best comedy category.The controversy served first-time Emmy host Seth Meyers well in his opening monologue as he joked about trying to submitting his ""Late Night"" show as a miniseries, but critics were left torn by the night's events.Alessandra Stanley at the New York Times said Meyers ""was charming, but he didn't take many risks, and overall, the ceremony was a brisk, rather tame event.""Tim Goodman at the Hollywood Reporter said the ""head-scratching awards show"" delivered winners ""all over the map,"" but praised Meyers for being ""affable and steady and kept the banter light and upbeat.""

208,"  (Corrects to say that Shamrock Capital is the investment arm of Roy E. Disney's family)* Funding round led by Shamrock Capital* Private equity firm KKR is new investor* FanDuel could look at IPO in next two or three years-CEOBy Liana B. BakerNEW YORK, Sept 2 - FanDuel, a startup that runs real-money fantasy sports leagues, said Tuesday it has raised $70 million in a funding round led by Shamrock Capital that also includes private equity firm KKR and NBC Sports.The company creates one-day tournaments for fantasy sports and expects to pay out $400 million in prizes this year. The valuation of the company after this funding round was not disclosed and neither was the amount that each investor contributed.NBC Sports is a division of NBCUniversal, a unit of Comcast Corp. Investors have been looking for new ways to capitalize on the rising value of live sports. FanDuel's latest move expands its previous total funding of $18 million by a wide margin. One of FanDuel's rivals, DraftKings raised $41 million in a funding round in late August.FanDuel's Chief Executive Officer Nigel Eccles said in an interview that the company turned profitable in the fourth quarter of last year. It generates revenue by keeping a cut of the entry fees fans pay to compete.Online fantasy sports that involves real money are not viewed by regulators as gambling since fantasy sports are considered to be games of skill that involve knowledge of professional athletes and statistics.Eccles said FanDuel will use the funds to invest more in the mobile version of the product and also increase spending on marketing. While some sources close to the deal told Reuters that FanDuel could one day be an acquisition target for a media company, Eccles said he would like the company to remain independent and he could see FanDuel pursuing an initial public offering.""We would look at an IPO in two or three years,"" he said.While season-long fantasy sports have been around for years they are dominated by companies such as ESPN, CBS and Yahoo Sports.FanDuel, meanwhile, is focused on contests that last one day. These term contests have the potential to spur a fan-following for late-season games in various sports that have no playoff consequences. ""The one day fantasy market has been very fast growing. It's right on the cusp of becoming mainstream,"" said Michael Lasalle, a partner at Shamrock who will join FanDuel's board.Shamrock Capital, which sold the Harlem Globetrotters last year, is the private equity firm that started as the investment arm of the family of Roy E. Disney, the son of Walt Disney's brother Roy.Previous investors in FanDuel that also participated in the round are Comcast's venture capital arm, Comcast Ventures, Pentech Ventures, Bullpen Capital, Scottish Enterprise and Richard Koch.Eccles said he was pleased that he can count large private equity firm KKR as a new backer for the company he co-founded.""Typically KKR focuses on much bigger companies but they approached us and we met them and liked the team. It's always good to have a very deep-pocketed investor supporting the company,"" he said.(Reporting by Liana B.

209,"   By Andrew Chung  The Walt Disney Co, creator of Mickey Mouse, is asking the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to refuse a trademark by electronic music star Deadmau5, who wears a LED-light powered, big-eared mouse helmet during concerts. Deadmau5, pronounced ""dead mouse,"" is the stage name for Joel Zimmerman, a Canadian disc jockey who has been nominated for and performed at the Grammy Awards. Zimmerman filed an application in 2013 with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to register his wide-smiling mouse symbol. In an opposition filing on Tuesday, Disney said the company would be damaged if he succeeds.""Lawyer up, Mickey,"" Zimmerman, 33, told his 3 million Twitter followers. ""Disney thinks you might confuse an established electronic musician/performer with a cartoon mouse. That's how stupid they think you are."" Disney representatives did not respond to a request for comment.  In 2010 Zimmerman trademarked a different mouse head symbol, with the face at a slight angle, and earlier this month applied for a trademark over yet another, this one with X's over the eyes. In its opposition this week, Disney presented the trademark office with a side-by-side comparison with its own three-circle mouse ears logo, saying Zimmerman's was likely to cause confusion and damage its brand.  Disney emphasized the popularity of Mickey, whose image it has used in films, music and cartoons and on clothing since 1928. ""Mickey Mouse is recognized as among the greatest animated characters of all time,"" the company said.Zimmerman's lawyer Dina LaPolt said in a statement: ""Our client will not be bullied by Disney and is prepared to fight to protect his rights to his property.""  She added in an emailed statement, ""(W)e wonder why Disney is only now coming after deadmau5,"" given the Deadmau5 symbol had been registered in 30 countries and had been used for a decade.

211,"   By Megumi Lim | TOKYO  TOKYO The artistic legacy of Hayao Miyazaki, the reclusive and bearded Academy Award-winning director and animator sometimes called Japan's Walt Disney, has never been more certain. Yet at the same time, the commercial future for Studio Ghibli, the privately held Tokyo studio he left behind in retirement, has never been more in doubt.Under Miyazaki, Ghibli became famous for intricate, hand-drawn animation and imaginative coming-of-age story lines that made films like 1988's ""My Neighbor Totoro"" into an international hit. A dozen years later, he masterminded what remains today as Japan's highest grossing film, the Academy Award-winning ""Spirited Away"".In recognition, Hollywood is about to add its ultimate honor by giving Miyazaki, 73, a lifetime achievement Academy Award.But the animation studio is finding that life after Miyazaki, who retired last year, is tough going. Ghibli's first release since the legendary animator's departure, ""When Marnie Was There"", has failed to catch fire with Japanese moviegoers over the summer.Besides the gaping hole left by Miyazaki, Ghibli, like Japanese companies in other industries, faces a range of challenges: high payroll costs, low productivity and the rise of new and cheaper hubs for production elsewhere in Asia.In six weeks, ""Marnie,"" the story of an asthmatic high school girl sent off for what becomes a summer marked by an unexpected and mysterious friendship, has taken in just $28 million at Japanese theaters. The mediocre takings comes as Ghibli’s fans and critics debate how and whether the studio will survive without the commercial magic of its founder.Senior producer Toshio Suzuki made waves last month when he said in a series of interviews that Studio Ghibli might have to dismantle the expensive production system set up under Miyazaki, which included employing full-time animators in Japan. ""We’re going to spring clean and restructure,"" Suzuki, 66, said in an interview with TBS broadcasting. Suzuki said the studio would take a break and could re-launch with a different and lower-cost business model that could shift production from Japan to Southeast Asia or Taiwan.""Ideas will be formed in Japan and the animation could be made in another country,” he said. “It will be ‘Made in Asia’.”Ghibli declined to make Suzuki or Miyazaki available for comment. A studio spokeswoman, who declined to be named, said the privately held company, had no further comment on its plans. QUALITY – AT A PRICE Famous for starting production without a complete script, Miyazaki insisted on working in pencil and spurned computer animation, resulting in intricately drawn frames and very long production spans. Some feature animations consist of about 10,000 drawings, but Ghibli’s sometimes exceed 80,000.In fact, Ghibli, under Miyazaki, made a virtue of its high-cost approach, doing everything - and working deliberately - from an ivy-covered, three-storey building in Tokyo's western suburbs. Ryusuke Hikawa, an expert on Japanese animation, estimates Ghibli was averaging just five minutes of animation production a month, given its recent pace of producing a feature every two years. That was sustainable when the studio, with Miyazaki at the helm, was turning out consistent hits. The nine Ghibli films that he directed averaged a box office take of $115 million. ""Spirited Away,"" which came out in 2001 and won the Academy Away for best animated feature, remains Japan’s highest grossing film, taking nearly $300 million at the box office - ahead of both “Titanic” and Disney’s “Frozen”.Box office takings are particularly important for Ghibli because the company has limited spin-off merchandising, another break from the approach of Hollywood studios which long ago abandoned hand-drawn animation for computers. In June, Suzuki, 66, told a podcast for fans he had cautioned staff to keep merchandising sales below $100 million to sharpen the focus on movie-making.In part, as a result, Ghibli has had a volatile earnings record, according to credit rating agency Tokyo Shoko Research, which audited the studio’s books. In the fiscal year that ended March 2012, it earned $9 million. That dropped to $5 million in 2013 and then jumped to $30 million in the just-ended fiscal year, reflecting the success of Miyazaki’s last film, “The Wind Rises”.Fans are focusing on ""Marnie"" because it is the first Ghibli film shaped entirely without the involvement of Miyazaki, Suzuki or the other famed Ghibli director, Isao Takahata. Yuichi Maeda, a movie critic, said the film's director, 41-year-old Hiromasa Yonebayashi, had delivered brilliantly drawn animation, but without the energy of a Miyazaki film. The studio said overseas distribution plans have yet to be decided.Maeda said he did not believe Ghibli could prosper without Miyazaki's guiding hand. “Ghibli’s popularity, unlike Pixar or Disney, depends on who directs its movies,” he said. “I don’t think Ghibli without Miyazaki can succeed.""

213,"   By Brendan Pierson  A federal lawsuit filed on Monday accuses Walt Disney Co, Sony Pictures and other leaders in special effects and animation of conspiring to suppress wages in the industry through ""no-raid"" agreements.The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in San Jose, California, also names DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc, Digital Domain 3.0 and ImageMovers LLC as defendants.The proposed class action alleges that the defendants agreed not to poach employees from one another, artificially depressing wages.Disney had already reached a $9 million settlement with  salaried employees in July 2013 as part of a broader class action lawsuit over no-raid agreements in the California technology industry.The proposed class in the new lawsuit consists of ""technical, artistic, creative and/or research and development"" employees and is not restricted to salaried employees.  The lawsuit alleges that the conspiracy in the animation industry dates back to 1986, when Lucasfilm Ltd and Pixar, now both part of Disney, agreed not to cold call each other's employees and not to outbid each other's pay offers, according to the complaint.Other defendants entered into similar agreements with one another by the mid-2000s or even earlier, according to the complaint.The lawsuit points to numerous emails from company executives referring to no-raid agreements. In one 2007 email, Pixar president Ed Catmull is quoted as saying that poaching each others' employees with higher pay offers ""seriously messes up the pay structure."" In another email, Catmull is quoted as saying that the animation companies had ""avoided wars"" because they had ""conscientiously avoided raiding each other.""Catmull acted as an enforcer, according to the complaint, urging other companies to stick to the no-raid rule even when they weren't directly threatening Pixar.In addition to the no-raid agreements, the lawsuit alleges that the companies' senior human resources and recruiting personnel met yearly to compare employee pay. A Disney spokesman said the suit was without merit and the company would defend it vigorously. A DreamWorks spokeswoman declined to comment.The new lawsuit comes about a month after U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose refused to approve a proposed $324.5 million settlement in the broader tech industry suit, partly because she found recovery for the class members would be too low compared with the Disney settlement approved earlier. Defendants in that case, including Google Inc and Apple Inc, are appealing her ruling.The case is Nitsch v.

215,"   By Brendan Pierson | Sept 8  Sept 8 A federal lawsuit filed on Monday accuses Walt Disney Co, Sony Pictures and other leaders in special effects and animation of conspiring to suppress wages in the industry through ""no-raid"" agreements.The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in San Jose, California also names DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc, Digital Domain 3.0 and ImageMovers LLC as defendants.The proposed class action alleges that the defendants agreed not to poach employees from one another, artificially depressing wages.Disney had already reached a $9 million settlement with  salaried employees in July 2013 as part of a broader class action over no-raid agreements in the California technology industry.The proposed class in the new lawsuit consists of ""technical, artistic, creative and/or research and development"" employees and is not restricted to salaried employees. The lawsuit alleges that the conspiracy in the animation industry dates back to 1986, when Lucasfilm Ltd and Pixar, now both part of Disney, agreed not to cold call each other's employees and not to outbid each other's pay offers, according to the complaint.Other defendants entered into similar agreements with one another by the mid-2000s or even earlier, according to the complaint. The lawsuit points to numerous emails from company executives referring to no-raid agreements. In one 2007 email, Pixar president Ed Catmull is quoted as saying that poaching each others' employees with higher pay offers ""seriously messes up the pay structure.""In another email, Catmull is quoted as saying that the animation companies had ""avoided wars"" because they had ""conscientiously avoided raiding each other.""Catmull acted as an enforcer, according to the complaint, urging other companies to stick to the no-raid rule even when they weren't directly threatening Pixar. In addition to the no-raid agreements, the lawsuit alleges that the companies' senior human resources and recruiting personnel met yearly to compare employee pay.The defendants could not immediately be reached for comment.The new lawsuit comes about a month after U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose refused to approve a proposed $324.5 million settlement in the broader tech industry suit, partly because she found recovery for the class members would be too low compared with the Disney settlement approved earlier. Defendants in that case, including Google Inc and Apple Inc, are appealing her ruling.The case is Nitsch v.

216,"  (Repeats to include link to graphic, no changes to text)By Megumi LimTOKYO, Sept 8 The artistic legacy of Hayao Miyazaki, the reclusive and bearded Academy Award-winning director and animator sometimes called Japan's Walt Disney, has never been more certain.Yet at the same time, the commercial future for Studio Ghibli, the privately held Tokyo studio he left behind in retirement, has never been more in doubt.Under Miyazaki, Ghibli became famous for intricate, hand-drawn animation and imaginative coming-of-age story lines that made films like 1988's ""My Neighbor Totoro"" into an international hit. A dozen years later, he masterminded what remains today as Japan's highest grossing film, the Academy Award-winning ""Spirited Away"".In recognition, Hollywood is about to add its ultimate honor by giving Miyazaki, 73, a lifetime achievement Academy Award.But the animation studio is finding that life after Miyazaki, who retired last year, is tough going.Ghibli's first release since the legendary animator's departure, ""When Marnie Was There"", has failed to catch fire with Japanese moviegoers over the summer.Besides the gaping hole left by Miyazaki, Ghibli, like Japanese companies in other industries, faces a range of challenges: high payroll costs, low productivity and the rise of new and cheaper hubs for production elsewhere in Asia.In six weeks, ""Marnie,"" the story of an asthmatic high school girl sent off for what becomes a summer marked by an unexpected and mysterious friendship, has taken in just $28 million at Japanese theatres. The mediocre takings comes as Ghibli's fans and critics debate how and whether the studio will survive without the commercial magic of its founder. Senior producer Toshio Suzuki made waves last month when he said in a series of interviews that Studio Ghibli might have to dismantle the expensive production system set up under Miyazaki, which included employing full-time animators in Japan.""We're going to spring clean and restructure,"" Suzuki, 66, said in an interview with TBS broadcasting.Suzuki said the studio would take a break and could re-launch with a different and lower-cost business model that could shift production from Japan to Southeast Asia or Taiwan.""Ideas will be formed in Japan and the animation could be made in another country,"" he said. ""It will be 'Made in Asia'."" Ghibli declined to make Suzuki or Miyazaki available for comment. A studio spokeswoman, who declined to be named, said the privately held company, had no further comment on its plans.QUALITY - AT A PRICE Famous for starting production without a complete script, Miyazaki insisted on working in pencil and spurned computer animation, resulting in intricately drawn frames and very long production spans. Some feature animations consist of about 10,000 drawings, but Ghibli's sometimes exceed 80,000. In fact, Ghibli, under Miyazaki, made a virtue of its high-cost approach, doing everything - and working deliberately - from an ivy-covered, three-storey building in Tokyo's western suburbs.Ryusuke Hikawa, an expert on Japanese animation, estimates Ghibli was averaging just five minutes of animation production a month, given its recent pace of producing a feature every two years.That was sustainable when the studio, with Miyazaki at the helm, was turning out consistent hits. The nine Ghibli films that he directed averaged a box office take of $115 million.""Spirited Away,"" which came out in 2001 and won the Academy Away for best animated feature, remains Japan's highest grossing film, taking nearly $300 million at the box office - ahead of both ""Titanic"" and Disney's ""Frozen"".Box office takings are particularly important for Ghibli because the company has limited spin-off merchandising, another break from the approach of Hollywood studios which long ago abandoned hand-drawn animation for computers. In June, Suzuki, 66, told a podcast for fans he had cautioned staff to keep merchandising sales below $100 million to sharpen the focus on movie-making.In part, as a result, Ghibli has had a volatile earnings record, according to credit rating agency Tokyo Shoko Research, which audited the studio's books. In the fiscal year that ended March 2012, it earned $9 million. That dropped to $5 million in 2013 and then jumped to $30 million in the just-ended fiscal year, reflecting the success of Miyazaki's last film, ""The Wind Rises"".Fans are focusing on ""Marnie"" because it is the first Ghibli film shaped entirely without the involvement of Miyazaki, Suzuki or the other famed Ghibli director, Isao Takahata.Yuichi Maeda, a movie critic, said the film's director, 41-year-old Hiromasa Yonebayashi, had delivered brilliantly drawn animation, but without the energy of a Miyazaki film. The studio said overseas distribution plans have yet to be decided.Maeda said he did not believe Ghibli could prosper without Miyazaki's guiding hand. ""Ghibli's popularity, unlike Pixar or Disney, depends on who directs its movies,"" he said. ""I don't think Ghibli without Miyazaki can succeed.""

Prosecutors said Faella is a member of the American Front, a nationwide, military-style, skinhead organization, which is modeled on Britain's far right, whites-only National Front. Faella was arrested in 2012 after an informant infiltrated his heavily fortified center for the AF on his isolated property in St. Cloud, about 11 miles from the Walt Disney World theme parks, according to an arrest affidavit.It said Faella had been ""planning and preparing the AF for what he believes to be an inevitable race war"" and had stated ""his intent ... to kill Jews, immigrants and other minorities"". The St. Cloud compound was shut down and 10 people arrested after the informant came to believe his life was in danger, the affidavit said. Prosecutors have since dropped most of the charges.

222,"   By Barbara Liston | ORLANDO, Fla., Sept 16  ORLANDO, Fla., Sept 16 Florida has a muscular new superhero, courtesy of Marvel Comics - Captain Citrus - a made-to-order crime fighter who promotes orange juice while battling evil through the power of the sun.""Maybe it's my solar pods - maybe it's my connection to these groves - or maybe you just really ticked me off. Either way, you're going down!"" warns Captain Citrus in the first digital edition of his adventures.The Florida Department of Citrus paid Marvel $1 million for the character and storyline as well as a marketing campaign that includes distributing a million free print copies of the comic book to elementary school students across the country, according to Citrus Department spokesman David Steele.The comic books come with lesson plans to teach children how to make smart nutritional choices, and feature orange juice as part of a healthy diet. The Marvel version of Captain Citrus is a square-jawed man with green hair and a skin-tight, orange-peel-colored suit, a full redesign of the Florida citrus industry's original 2011 version, which was a round orange character with legs, arms and a green cape.The updated character will also interact with the popular Avengers Assemble team of superheroes, and have its print edition debut in October at New York Comic Con, an industry trade show. The debut comic book introduces readers to John Polk, a.k.a Captain Citrus, who is empowered by mysterious solar pods in the grove where he grew up. Captain Citrus joins the Avengers to battle bad guys in Orlando.Marvel, owned by the Walt Disney Co, was an obvious choice for a marketing campaign given the target audience of fourth- and fifth-grade students, Steele said. ""They are the best in the world at what they do: developing dynamic characters, compelling storylines, cultivating lifelong relationships with fans and leveraging that good will to build brand loyalty,"" Steele said of Marvel.Orange juice sales have been hurt by citrus greening, a bacterial infection ravaging Florida groves that has reduced orange production to its lowest level in 50 years. Sales also have been hurt by campaigns to cut consumption of sugary drinks, including 100 percent juice that is naturally sweet, Steele said.The current digital edition and digital sequels in January and March can be accessed here.

The technology should arrive on the consumer mass market within two years.Virtual reality can transport audiences into the middle of the movie landscape, says Brendan Iribe, chief executive of Oculus, which Facebook Inc acquired this year for $2 billion.""In some decade or two, we are going to be at a point where watching things on 2D surfaces is going to feel pretty outdated,"" Iribe told Reuters.Virtual reality still has technological hurdles to overcome. The biggest problem is motion sickness in some users, which Oculus believes it is close to resolving.Hollywood directors are trying to figure out how to create 360-degree scenes, and it remains unclear if audiences will want to spend two hours in a virtual world, or just visit for shorter experiences. BABY STEPS FOR BIGGER SCREENS Iribe has big ambitions for Oculus Rift devices, the latest version unveiled at a developers conference on Saturday in Hollywood. A prototype is sold now to developers for $350 per headset.With a consumer version on the horizon, Iribe believes virtual reality devices could be in the hands of millions of consumers within a couple of years.Designers at Disney's Lucasfilm are playing around on the desert planet Tatooine, exploring how to bring virtual reality to the ""Star Wars"" universe as the studio prepares to release Episode VII of the film franchise in 2015. ""Lucasfilm absolutely thinks this is a phenomenal space to be in,"" said John Gaeta, Lucasfilm's Oscar-winning creative director of new media and experiences.To take smaller steps toward bigger screens, digital projection company Barco is introducing Barco Escape, a 270-degree panoramic screen, in movie theaters. The three-piece screen expands to the left and right of the theater walls.Fox is currently testing Barco Escape in select Cinemark theaters with young adult thriller ""The Maze Runner"",  where scenes were extended onto the expanded screens using computer-generated digital imagery.""Maze Runner"" director Wes Ball said the extended screens were intended to immerse viewers in the visually expanded world of the film, without detracting from the central screen. 'PLACES NOBODY HAS GONE' The bigger screens will attract younger audiences, especially those used to the bigger screens in video games, said Barco's ""cinemavangelist"" Ted Schilowitz. He is also Fox's resident ""Futurist,"" developing projects in a virtual reality bunker on the studio's Los Angeles lot. Disney's Pixar Animation Studios is also testing Barco Escape.Schilowitz calls Barco Escape the ""bricks and mortar version"" of virtual reality and films adapted to the 270-degree screen format can work on Oculus Rift.""This is the average consumer's entry point to what a more immersive experience feels like,"" he said.Oscar-nominated filmmaker Guillermo Del Toro, an early adopter of new technology in film, presented an Oculus Rift game based on 2013's ""Pacific Rim"" at San Diego's Comic-Con in July. But Del Toro told Reuters ""it will be hard to direct (a movie) because you have to show the audience what to see"" when viewers can look anywhere.But Robert Stromberg is undeterred. The Oscar-winning production designer of 2009's ""Avatar"" and director of Disney blockbuster ""Maleficent"" now splits his time between traditional filmmaking and virtual reality storytelling, developing content for Oculus devices.""I'm really trying to see how the two can marry together,"" he said.

Cable and satellite providers pay Disney and Time Warner richly for their sports-heavy content. ESPN executives insist they are committed to the current pay TV system, and that any programming sold directly to consumers will complement rather than compete with the content available through pay TV packages.But others said the streaming channel could have the same kind of transformative effect on sports programming that Netflix Inc has had on dramas and sitcoms. ""This is the first crack in the structure of the television business that has been in place for decades,"" said Forrester analyst Jim Nail. Under the new deal, ESPN will make a limited number of regular season NBA games available on the streaming channel, the sources said. The offerings will be expanded to include other sports, they said. The sources could not speak on the record because terms of the deal were not public.ESPN said in May that it was considering selling online access to live Major League Soccer games to consumers without pay TV subscriptions.  The network said in a statement on Monday it has a framework in place with the NBA for the streaming service, and that the league would have an equity interest in the product. ESPN offered the equity interest to the NBA as an incentive for the league to choose the streaming service - rather than a new programming partner such as Fox - for certain games, the sources said. The games being made available are those not already being shown on television ESPN and Turner as part of the rights renewal package, they said. NBA DEAL  Disney and Time Warner Inc's Turner Broadcasting System will more than double their annual payments to the NBA under the new nine-year deal, people familiar with the matter said.Starting in the 2016-17 season, the two networks will pay more than $2.5 billion, an increase from $960 million per year in the past agreement. Over nine years, the deal could be worth upwards of $22.5 billion. ESPN paid a bigger share than Turner because its deal includes international and radio rights, as well as WNBA games, according to people familiar with the matter. The agreement comes just days after satellite provider DirecTV agreed to pay $1.5 billion a year to extend its exclusive contract to sell its ""Sunday Ticket"" package of National Football League games.  Both deals are a reminder of the unique allure of sports programming for broadcasters and cable networks, whose non-sports lineups have been losing viewers to streaming services like Netflix or are being watched on digital video recorders that allow users to skip commercials.     ABC and ESPN, both owned by Disney, will televise 100 regular-season games per year, and TNT, which is owned by Turner Broadcasting, will televise 64, the NBA said.

245,"   By Jennifer Saba | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Ten years ago, Walt Disney Co, having fended off a hostile bid from Comcast, had to make a case why it was better off as an independent company.It succeeded. Disney's shares have soared more than 250 percent since.Now, Time Warner Inc Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes faces a similar moment of reckoning after rejecting a bid for $85 a share from Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox. Bewkes and other top brass will be under pressure at a meeting with analysts and investors next Wednesday to show they can repeat Disney's magic.""Disney pleaded the case to get its share price up on their own,"" said David Miller, an analyst with Topeka Capital Markets.""We think that Mr. Bewkes will attempt to drive home the same concept,"" he said, adding it remained to be seen if Bewkes would manage to replicate Disney's sterling stock performance.Time Warner is trading at around $73 - more than twice its price since Bewkes took over as CEO in 2008, but still below Murdoch's original $85 bid. Fox had considered boosting the offer to as high as $95 a share, people familiar with the matter said.  Rejection has had its price. Time Warner shares have dropped 15 percent since Aug. 5, when Fox walked away from its offer. Fox shares are up 5.7 percent over the same period.""It's too simple to say that Bewkes has to get the stock price over $85,"" said Gabelli & Co analyst Brett Harriss.  ""He has to tell us why he said no to Fox. Time Warner has said nothing - only that at no price would it combine with Fox.""Gabelli, an asset management firm, holds shares in Time Warner. Harriss thought a combined Fox and Time Warner would benefit both companies. Bewkes, who last stood in front of investors during a similar meeting four years ago, will lay out a long-term vision for the company's Warner Bros movie studio, Turner Broadcasting cable networks and pay TV channel HBO. Those plans could include letting consumers buy HBO without a cable subscription, given the popularity of the HBO GO mobile app, some analysts have said. Topeka's Miller said that a new broadband-only product similar to Netflix could crack open new markets.Topeka estimates that there are approximately 9 million households in the United States with Internet access but no pay TV and roughly 66 million households with pay TV but no HBO. Indeed, Bewkes has slowly changed his tune about Netflix that he once derided as a ""200-pound chimp."" He said Monday, at a conference hosted by Hollywood website The Wrap, that he wished he personally owned the streaming video service, given its market value of around $30 billion.There are other signs of Time Warner's long-term plan that have emerged over the past weeks. Turner Broadcasting and Disney's ESPN more than doubled their annual payments to the NBA under a new nine-year deal worth more than $22 billion. Collectively, TBS and ESPN will pay more than $2.5 billion, starting in the 2016-17 season, to the basketball league. The networks coughed up more to keep the rights out of the hands of Fox - which started its own sports network - and those of other rivals.The pricey content deal comes as Turner, which also operates the 24-hour news channel CNN, attempts to crack down on costs. The company, which employs about 14,000 full-time staffers, is poised to slash 10 percent of its workforce.Focusing on internal operations is how Disney jolted it shares, noted Topeka's Miller - a strategy likely to be embraced by Bewkes.

250,"   By Piya Sinha-Roy | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Oct 22 An oversized personal health-care robot assistant might seem out of place next to the princesses and furry animals that have won over legions of fans, young and old, in animated films.But for every young girl belting out ""Frozen"" princess anthem ""Let It Go,"" Walt Disney Co is betting there's a nerd who will root for the geeks and robot fighting evil in ""Big Hero 6.""Disney's big film this year leads a field of offbeat animated movies featuring little green monsters and a Day of the Dead love triangle that could lure new audiences to animation, an increasingly vibrant segment of the movie industry, both creatively and economically.The Marvel comics-inspired ""Big Hero 6,"" in theaters on Nov. 7, is centered in a futuristic world of robotics and takes place in Sanfransokyo, which imagines San Francisco fused with Tokyo.""It coincides with nerd culture being popular in pop culture,"" said Don Hall, who co-directed the film with Chris Williams, both self-described nerds.Princess tales and the animal world dominated animation until the late 1990s with movies such as ""The Lion King"" and ""The Little Mermaid.""Since then, unconventional heroes and edgier humor have emerged to push animated fare beyond kids-only consumption.There's the swamp-dwelling ogre ""Shrek"" from DreamWorks Animation SKG's and the child-frightening goofball monsters from Pixar Animation's ""Monster's Inc."" and Steve Carell's charmingly awful villain in ""Despicable Me"" - all which have gone on to sequels. ""Big Hero 6"" is Disney's first animated foray into the Marvel world, inspired by an obscure comic of the same name.The protagonist is scrawny teen robotics prodigy Hiro, who, after suffering a tragic loss, befriends inflatable waddling robot Baymax, designed to be a personal health-care assistant. Hiro and his university buddies use their scientific prowess to transform themselves and Baymax into superheroes to combat a Kabuki-masked villain.""(Animation) is attracting more and more talented people and they're creating more sophisticated stories,"" said Williams, adding that studios like Pixar have ""really done a lot to remove any stigma that animation is just for kids and families."" 'DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT' Animated films in 2013 accounted for $1.7 billion of the $10.2 billion in ticket sales at U.S. and Canadian box offices, according to movie tracking company Rentrak. Disney's ""Frozen"" alone has made $1.2 billion worldwide since its November 2013 release.With animation making more money than ever before at the global box office and technological advances allowing such films to be made faster, competition is heating up for distinctive content.""We know that we need to make a place for ourselves in the world and in the market, and we need to do something different,"" said Anthony Stacchi, co-director of independent Laika studios' ""The Boxtrolls,"" about grotesque green misunderstood creatures with caring hearts. Made for $60 million and distributed by Focus Features in September, ""The Boxtrolls"" has grossed $75 million worldwide.When making ""The Book of Life"" with Twenty-First Century Fox's Twentieth Century Fox, the first major studio animated film rooted in Mexican culture, filmmaker Jorge Gutierrez wasn't worried about how it would resonate with non-Hispanic audiences.""In order to be universal, you have to be specific,"" he said, citing France's ""Amelie"" and Brazil's ""City of God"" movies as ""being of their countries, but are so beloved over the world.""""The Book of Life,"" which opened with $17 million in U.S. theaters last week, follows a love story centered on Mexico's Day of the Dead festival that flits between the living and the underworld realms of the dead.Acclaimed director Guillermo del Toro, who produced ""Book of Life,"" said the film ""breaks a lot of molds"" that have been set in Hollywood's animated fare.""The problem is that people think animation is a genre for kids,"" Del Toro said. ""I think American animation is all much more poor by not tackling other subjects.""While the movie is targeted to all audiences, Gutierrez did make ""Book of Life"" to represent the Hispanic community, a growing force in the movie industry, in film.""The Latino audience ... has exploded, and they are hungry to see themselves up on the screen,"" he said. ""They go to the movies more than anyone ever thought.""

255,"  (Adds details and quotes throughout)By Piya Sinha-RoyLOS ANGELES Oct 28 The Marvel cinematic universe is expanding with new characters Doctor Strange, Black Panther and Captain Marvel, who will be the first female superhero to anchor her own Marvel film, the Walt Disney Co-owned studio said on Tuesday.Marvel's new slate of eight superhero films announced at a fan event includes both sequels to its stream of box office hits and new franchises, with ""Doctor Strange"" kicking off the newcomers in 2016.Doctor Strange is a former neurosurgeon who loses the ability to perform surgery and turns to magic. Despite widespread reports that he would be played by British actor Benedict Cumberbatch, Marvel did not confirm casting.""We are excited to tap into what excites us the most, which is the supernatural,"" Marvel studio president Kevin Feige said. ""If (casting) were confirmed, we would have introduced him today. Every single actor of a certain age has been rumored to be Doctor Strange,"" he added.Feige also said there is plenty of time to find an actress to play Captain Marvel, the alter-ego of a character named Carol Danvers, for the film that will be released in July 2018.While Marvel has female superheroes like Black Widow played by Scarlett Johansson, this is the first time a woman will anchor a film in what is widely seen as an effort to bring more women and girls to the fanboy heavy Marvel universe. Feige said there are no plans for a stand-alone Black Widow film, but that Johansson's character will continue to be featured prominently in the other Marvel films.Black Panther, the superhero alter-ego of T'Challa, will premiere in 2017 and will be played by ""42"" actor Chadwick Boseman, who will also appear in ""Captain America: Civil War,"" the third installment of the ""Captain America"" franchise starring Chris Evans.Boseman and Evans were joined by ""Iron Man"" Robert Downey Jr. at the event held where fans erupted in screams and cheers while the actors bantered on stage for a few minutes. Disney has had a succession of blockbuster hits from its recently acquired Marvel Studios, from Downey Jr's ""Iron Man,"" Evans' ""Captain America"" and Chris Hemsworth's ""Thor.""Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston, who plays popular supervillain Loki, will return in ""Thor: Ragnarok"" in July 2017, and Feige said the film will set a new timeline of events that will be followed in future Marvel films, which are often interconnected.""Avengers: Infinity War,"" the third installment of the ensemble superhero franchise, will be split into two parts, with part one released in May 2018 and part two in May 2019.With Disney Animation releasing its first Marvel-inspired movie ""Big Hero 6"" next week and ""Ant-Man"" and ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" scheduled for next year, Marvel is pushing ahead with new characters and franchises.In addition to new solo superheroes, Marvel will unveil the ensemble cast of ""Inhumans"" in 2018 for its 20th film, with Feige saying he hopes it will lead to numerous spin-off franchises.

From the floating wind turbines painted in the style of Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli films and characters inspired by anime, to finding Baymax's face in the two holes connected by a line in small Japanese bells, Japanese influences are woven into the Disney aesthetic. To create Sanfransokyo, Disney Animation's chief technology officer Andy Hendrickson devised software to map Tokyo-style buildings over the current layout of San Francisco.

262,"  Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) reported a better-than-expected 7 percent increase in quarterly revenue on Thursday, driven by hit movies ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and ""Maleficent.""""Guardians,"" which was released in July, and ""Maleficent,"" starring Angelina Jolie as a black-robed villain, helped drive almost 18 percent growth in Disney's movie studio unit.Disney's shares were off 1.8 percent at $90.35 in extended-trading, after closing at a record high of $92 on Thursday.""Guardians"" features a machine-gun-toting raccoon amid a cast of misfit super heroes. ""Maleficent"" brings back one of Disney's most popular character since she appeared as the wicked fairy in the 1959 animated feature ""Sleeping Beauty"".The studio business also benefited from strong DVD sales of ""Frozen,"" a story about two royal sisters in an icy kingdom.Operating income at sports behemoth ESPN declined due to higher contract rates for high-end National Football League and Major League Baseball games, which helped drag down the company's cable networks unit by 1 percent. The drop in operating income at cable networks likely drove Disney shares lower, said Gabelli & Company analyst Brett Harriss, who rates Disney a ""hold."" ""Cable networks were a little weak,"" he said.Harriss said he expected ESPN would make up for the higher programing costs in future quarters through higher fees from affiliates. Revenue in Disney's Media Networks, home to Disney channels,  ESPN and ABC, rose 5.5 percent due to higher broadcasting revenue from shows such as ""Shark Tank"" and ""America's Funniest Home Videos."" Parks and resorts revenue rose 7 percent due to increased attendance and higher ticket prices for theme park admissions.Net income attributable to Walt Disney rose to $1.50 billion, or 86 cents per share, in the fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 27, from $1.39 billion, or 77 cents per share, a year earlier.On an adjusted basis, the company earned 89 cents per share, in line with analysts' estimates. Revenue rose to $12.39 billion, marginally above the average analyst estimate of $12.37 billion.Disney's slate of releases for the current quarter are ""Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day"" released in October and ""Into the Woods"" to be released at Christmas.Up to Thursday's close, the stock has gained about 20 percent this year.

""Whenever the rules have potential to change everybody gets nervous.""UnitedHealth Group fell 2.7 percent to $93.61, ranking as the largest weight on the Dow industrials. Hospital operator Tenet Healthcare fell 6.5 percent to $47.85 while managed care facilities operator Humana Inc was down 6.6 percent to $130.58.Healthcare stocks had been pressured from the opening bell by Salix Pharmaceuticals, which closed down 34 percent at $91.47 in its biggest-ever daily drop.Salix on Thursday slashed its full-year forecast given swollen drug inventories, an issue that dissuaded Allergan from acquiring the drugmaker, people familiar with the matter said. On the flip side, employers added 214,000 jobs last month, below the 231,000 expected in a Reuters poll of economists, while gains in the previous two months were revised higher. The unemployment rate fell to 5.8 percent, the lowest since July 2008, even as more people entered the labor force.""With data like this the Federal Reserve doesn't feel compelled to come in and help, or squash a too-hot economy,"" said Fort Pitt Capital's Forrest. ""No more Fed (asset) buying but also no rate hikes quite yet.""Walt Disney Co fell 2.2 percent to $90 a day after earnings met expectations. The stock had closed Thursday at $92, a record high. First Solar sank 10.8 percent to $50.29 as the biggest decliner on the S&P 500 a day after the company said it would not spin off its solar power plants into a separate, publicly traded entity as some of its competitors have done.Energy shares on the S&P 500 were the day's strongest performers, rising 1 percent.

A Florida man accused of training members of a white supremacist group for a ""race war"" at a heavily fortified compound near Orlando and Walt Disney World was sentenced on Monday to six months in jail, according to court records.Marcus Faella, 41, was convicted earlier this year on two counts of paramilitary training. Authorities in central Florida called him the ringleader of a group they broke up in 2012, saying at the time it intended to kill Jews, immigrants and other minorities.He was a member of the American Front, prosecutors said, describing the group as a nationwide, military-style, skinhead organization modeled on Britain's whites-only National Front. At his sentencing, Faella was given credit for 61 days he had already served in jail, court records show. He also will serve two years of community control, the Orlando Sentinel reported.A confidential informant infiltrated the neo-Nazi organization, leading to his arrest in 2012 at a fortified compound on his isolated property in St. Cloud, Florida. It was located 11 miles from the Disney theme parks. According to an arrest affidavit, Faella had been ""planning and preparing the AF for what he believes to be an inevitable race war"" and had stated ""his intent ... to kill Jews, immigrants and other minorities.""Ten others were arrested and the compound shuttered after the informant came to believe his life was in danger, the arrest affidavit said. Prosecutors have since dropped most of the charges. Following his conviction, Faella's attorney said he would seek to have the conviction overturned, the Orlando Sentinel reported.

273,"   By Ronald Grover  Nov 17 Merger talks between Hasbro Inc  and DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc formally ended on Monday morning, when the toy company's board voted to walk away, according to a person with knowledge of the board's actions.Discussions had cooled after members of the board visited DreamWorks' Glendale, California studio complex, and press reports surfaced about the talks last Wednesday.Hasbro's enthusiasm for the deal also waned after executives at Walt Disney Co's consumer product unit voiced concern about the possible arrangement, said another person familiar with knowledge of the situation. Disney and Hasbro had agreed on Sept. 24 for Hasbro to make dolls based on Disney's Princess and ""Frozen"" properties. Both sources could not be identified because neither is authorized to speak publicly.The maker of the ""Shrek"" and ""Madagascar"" film series was seeking $3 billion, or $38 a share, although Hasbro never made a bid, the person with knowledge of the Hasbro board said. DreamWorks stock closed down 14 percent at $22.31 on the NASDAQ. Hasbro shares ended up 4.35 percent at $56.37 on the same exchange.Hasbro Chief Executive Brian Goldner brought the idea of buying DreamWorks to the toymaker's board, after working closely with DreamWorks' Chief Executive Jeffrey Katzenberg over several months on designing characters for the studio's movie based on its ""Trolls"" toy. Hasbro board members one night last week had dinner with Katzenberg at the CEO's newly-built Beverly Hills home, and spent the next day at the studio.The two companies signed a deal in 2013 for Hasbro to make toys inspired by DreamWorks' upcoming ""B.O.O.: Bureau of Otherworldly Operations"" and ""Trolls"" movies.A Hasbro spokeswoman did not return emails. DreamWorks and Disney spokeswomen had no comment.

274,"  LONDON Britain's Merlin Entertainments is to open a Legoland theme park in South Korea, as part of its long term expansion plans to generate more of its income from overseas markets.Merlin, the world's second largest operator of visitor attractions behind Walt Disney, said the new theme park  will cost up to 172 million pounds ($269.8 million).It will invest around a third of the total, with the rest coming from a property company funded by local investors.  The site will open in 2017 in the northern town of Chuncheon, Gangwon Province and adds to the group's growing portfolio of six Legoland parks around the world. Merlin, which listed on the London stock market in November last year, is aiming to expand its business in the Americas and Asia Pacific with new sites. It currently generates more than 60 percent of its revenues from Britain and continental Europe but its ultimate goal is for an equal split between Europe, the Americas and Asia Pacific.  The company said in July it was advanced talks to open more Legoland Parks overseas after a sales surge at its U.S. sites on the back of ""The Lego Movie""  helped boost first half-profits. Its shares added 1.2 percent to 371p by 0900 GMT (4 a.m. EST), compared with a flotation price of 315p.

277,"   By Joseph Kolb | ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.  ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. Hollywood is paying a tribute of sorts to the largest American Indian-speaking population in the United States by translating the wildly popular children's film ""Finding Nemo"" into Navajo. Advocates of the tribal language say it is slowly dying out, and that the move by Disney-Pixar could help it find a new generation of speakers by reaching out directly to children. Marilyn Reeves, an Albuquerque-area Navajo grandmother, said her two grandchildren already watch the 2003 movie about the loveable clownfish every day. ""I think translating it will give them a chance to catch on to Navajo faster because they can see how it is used,"" she said.Reeves said her family occasionally speaks Navajo at home, in part because she can see that each generation uses it less  as children grow up and leave the reservation. ""This translation helps legitimize our language,"" she said. The Navajo ""Finding Nemo"" will be released next spring and will be the second movie translated into the language, after ""Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope"" was translated in 2013. ""After dubbing Star Wars in Navajo and seeing the audience reaction, I knew we needed to do more for the kids,"" Manuelito Wheeler, director of the Navajo Nation Museum, said in a statement.""This movie is a true classic and we will work hard to uphold the Disney and Pixar standard while giving our Navajo kids an engaging and imaginative way to learn their language,"" Wheeler said. Navajo is a language that often employs a description of what the word does to relay its meaning. Therefore, a single English word can require several words in Navajo.Tribal member Anita Yazzie said she was amused by how much the dialogue was changed in last year's Star Wars translation.""It made me laugh, hearing R2D2 speak Navajo,"" Yazzie said. ""Sometimes it made it hard to follow the movie."" The most famous exponents of the Navajo language were the 29 ""code talkers"" who developed an unbreakable cipher based on their language that helped Allied forces win World War Two.The Navajo are not the only American Indian tribe to have a feature film translated into their language. In the mid-1990s, Disney translated another animated classic, Bambi, into Arapaho.U.S. Census data shows there are 286,000 Navajo living off and on the sprawling reservation in Arizona and New Mexico.

284,"  Dec 10 Dish Network Corp does not want to include broadcast channels in the basic package for its planned online TV service, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.The second-largest U.S. satellite TV company's plan to exclude broadcasters could become a sticking point in deals with major media companies, the Journal said.The video streaming service will allow customers to watch TV programs, sporting events and other content through a broadband connection.Dish's move to relegate broadcasters such as ABC, CBS Corp  , NBC and Fox to a different tier could cost consumers more, the Journal reported. The internet TV service is likely to become a cheaper alternative to traditional cable and satellite services.The service, which is expected to launch soon, will cost about a dollar a day, or about $30 a month, the Journal added. Walt Disney Co has already signed a deal that gives Dish the option to place the ABC network on a separate tier, the Journal quoted people as saying. Englewood, Colorado-based Dish's failure to convince other broadcasters to become a part of a separate tier within a certain time would result in ABC becoming a part of the basic Dish package, the Journal said.Earlier this month, Dish and CBS indicated there was a path to negotiate rights for streaming content, but did not elaborate further.Dish was not available for comment outside of regular business hours.

""We'll respond proportionally, and we'll respond in a place and time and manner that we choose.""Earlier, the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced it had determined that North Korea was behind the hacking of Sony, saying Pyongyang's actions fell ""outside the bounds of acceptable state behavior.""Obama said North Korea appeared to have acted alone. Washington began consultations with Japan, China, South Korea and Russia seeking their assistance in reining in North Korea. {ID:nL1N0U32BR]It was the first time the United States had directly accused another country of a cyberattack of such magnitude on American soil and set up a possible new confrontation between longtime foes Washington and Pyongyang.The destructive nature of the attack, and threats from the hackers that led the Hollywood studio to pull the movie, set it apart from previous cyber intrusions, the FBI said.A North Korean diplomat at the United Nations in New York said Pyongyang had nothing to do with the cyberattack.

289,"  LOS ANGELES Jan 2 The inaugural College Football Playoff drew more than 28 million television viewers to both semifinal games, sports network ESPN said on Friday, touting that number as the two largest cable television audiences ever.An average audience of 28.3 million watched Ohio State upset top-seed Alabama 42-35 in the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans on New Year's day, according to Nielsen.Oregon's 59-20 victory over defending champion Florida State earlier on Thursday in the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, was watched by an average of 28.2 million viewers. Second-ranked Oregon will meet No. 4 Ohio State on Jan. 12 in Arlington, Texas, for the national championship.The four-team playoff has replaced the poll system that would determine which college teams would face each other for the championship. Last year's Rose Bowl game drew 18.6 million and the Sugar Bowl drew 11.3 million. The highly profitable ESPN, a major revenue generator for owner Walt Disney Co, agreed in 2012 to pay more than $7 billion to broadcast college bowl games and the playoffs. The deal took effect in 2014 and runs for 12 years.Television networks reap some of their top advertising rates from sporting events because most sports viewers prefer to watch games live instead of recording them. Advertisers prefer viewers to watch programming live because they cannot fast-forward past commercials, as they can with programs they have recorded.

290,"   By Lisa Richwine | ANAHEIM, California  ANAHEIM, California Jan 7 At 5 a.m. on a Sunday, thousands of people stream down Disneyland Drive dressed in a mix of running gear, homemade costumes and face paint as Captain America, Thor or The Hulk.It's the first Avengers Super Heroes Half Marathon, a 13.1-mile contest that is part of an expanding slate of sold-out races at Walt Disney's theme parks in California and Florida.Runners come to Disney races for the chance to dash past Space Mountain or Cinderella Castle, grab high-fives from costumed characters, and show off their fandom.For Disney, which has become one of the nation's biggest race organizers, the multi-day influx of runners, relatives and friends provides a chance to earn extra cash and help fill theme parks and hotels during slower weekends.""I love the atmosphere,"" said Lauren Harrell, 27, after she finished the November super heroes race in a hand-painted T-shirt and foam headpiece as Groot, the human-like tree in Disney's Marvel Studios film ""Guardians of the Galaxy.""""People are cheering you every step of the way. And nobody judges you for dressing in costume,"" said Harrell, who had a speaker attached to her waist so she could dance and sing to the ""Guardians"" soundtrack. What started with one race in 1994 has swelled to 190,000 people registering for the seven Disney race weekends from October 2013 to September 2014. Many races sell out within hours.This weekend's Walt Disney World Marathon in Orlando, Florida, is the largest race weekend in the country, according to race director Jon Hughes.Starting Thursday, more than 53,000 runners will compete over four days in a marathon, half-marathon, 10K or 5K. Some will enter more than one race, and enthusiasts will finish all four, a 48.6-mile feat called the Dopey Challenge.Two more race weekends have been added to this year's runDisney schedule, including a Star Wars Half Marathon at Disneyland in California, from Jan. 15 to 18. Other upcoming events include half marathons with Disney Princess or Tinker Bell themes.The races take place inside Disney resorts and on neighboring streets but outside of regular park hours. Related events include kids' races, a Diaper Dash for crawlers, and a carb-loading Pasta in the Park party.Disney designs the races for first-time runners up to elite athletes, said Maribeth Bisienere, a senior vice president who oversees the runDisney business. Competitive runners can use their Disney marathon results to qualify for the Boston Marathon. Contestants there for fun can stop for photos with Disney characters. ""It is unusual that you get both ends of the running gamut,"" Bisienere said.Entry fees, which include a shirt and medal, range from $60 for a 5K, to $170-$195 for a marathon or half marathon. A visit to the park to ride the attractions costs extra.Fans say the Disney experience is worth the price.At the Avengers race, which wound through Disneyland and the nearby Angel Stadium, runners carried red, white and blue Captain America shields and cardboard versions of Thor's hammer, or sported Mickey Mouse ears.JT Rose, 42, from Kingsport, Tennessee, in his seventh Disney race, ran as Thor's brother Loki, with a homemade staff and helmet. ""Everybody who comes to Disney gets into it,"" said Rose. ""All the fans are just going crazy. It's just a really fun race.""(Reporting by Lisa Richwine, Editing by Jill Serjeant and Michael Perry)",2015-01-07,DIS,"Wed Jan 7, 2015 | 9:00am EST","FEATURE-Off to the races!

299,"  (Adds CEO comments, details from conference call; updates shares)By Shailaja SharmaJan 30 Mattel Inc needs to move with a ""sense of urgency"" to create toys that connect with young customers, its interim CEO said, as dolls based on Disney's blockbuster film ""Frozen"" stole the show from its Barbie dolls in the holiday quarter.The company, which also makes Fisher-Price preschool toys and Monster High and American Girl dolls, reported its fifth straight fall in worldwide quarterly sales on Friday.Mattel's shares were unchanged in noon trading, recovering from a 2.6 percent drop earlier.Worldwide sales of Barbie fell 12 percent in the fourth quarter, while those of Fisher-Price toys declined 11 percent.Christopher Sinclair, who took Mattel's reins after it removed Bryan Stockton as CEO on Monday, said the company's brand propositions were not compelling enough, mainly for Barbie and Fisher-Price. Mattel spent 40 percent more on advertising in the quarter, but that did not translate into sales, Sinclair said.Industry-wide toy sales in the United States rose 4 percent in 2014, according to consumer research firm NPD Group.In the period, Mattel's sales fell 7 percent, highlighting the company's failure to innovate faster than smaller rivals Jakks Pacific Inc and Hasbro Inc. Jakks makes dolls based on ""Frozen"", such as Snow Glow Elsa and Anna Ice Skating doll. Hasbro's products include My Little Pony toys and ""Hunger Games"" inspired Nerf Rebelle bow and arrow toys.Mattel's sales fell in six of the 12 quarters that Stockton was CEO. He took the top job in 2012.Barbie sales have been falling for the past two years as young girls increasingly favor electronic toys, tablets and toys based on popular films. Denmark's privately held Lego Group dethroned Mattel as the world's largest toymaker by sales in the first half of 2014, helped by the success of its toys based on ""The Lego Movie"". Lego is yet to report full-year sales.Most of Mattel's revenue comes from brands that are at least three decades old. Fisher-Price was launched in 1930, Barbie in 1959 and American Girl in 1986.The company's net income plunged nearly 60 percent to $149.9 million, or 44 cents per share, in the fourth quarter.Excluding items, Mattel earned 52 cents per share, lower than the average analyst estimate of 92 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Worldwide sales fell about 6 percent to $1.99 billion.Mattel's shares were at $27 in noon trading on the Nasdaq.

The stock reached record highs in recent months on strong performances across its TV networks, theme parks and movie studio. Each of its five divisions reported higher operating income for the quarter, ended Dec. 27.At Disney's parks unit, operating income rose 20 percent to $805 million as more people visited its U.S. parks and increased spending on tickets, merchandise, food and drinks.Chief Executive Bob Iger told CNBC that there had been no discernable impact on parks from a measles outbreak that health officials have said began at Disneyland in Anaheim, California, in December.Disney now plans to open its Shanghai Disneyland theme park in the spring of 2016, Iger told analysts. The company had earlier set a target of a late 2015 opening but decided to add attractions to the park, a $5.5 billion joint venture with China's state-owned Shanghai Shendi Group. ""Frozen"" toys sold particularly well during the holiday shopping quarter, helping Disney's consumer products unit earn a $626 million profit, up 46 percent from a year earlier. Disney will fuel the franchise with ""Frozen Fever"" a seven-minute film that features a new song and will be shown in theaters ahead of its live action ""Cinderella"" movie, to be  released on March 13.""We actually believe it's going to generate some more buzz for 'Frozen,' and that should generate more buying in terms of consumer products,"" Iger said.  Disney's movie studio recorded a 33 percent jump in profit, driven by home entertainment sales of ""Frozen,"" Marvel's ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and ""Maleficent."" Profit at cable networks fell 2 percent, hurt by higher programming and production costs and lower advertising revenue at sports channel ESPN. Broadcasting unit ABC recorded a 35 percent increase in operating income from higher affiliate fees and program sales.Net profit attributable to Walt Disney rose to $2.18 billion, or $1.27 per share, in the quarter, from $1.03 per share a year earlier.

318,"  SEATTLE A century-old Seattle house that was featured in a marketing stunt to publicize Walt Disney Co's balloon adventure movie ""Up"" because it is wedged in the middle of a modern development could be sold at auction next month, media reported on Friday.Edith Macefield drew national media coverage when she refused in 2006 a $1 million offer for her 1,000-square-foot house from an investment company that eventually developed a 131,000-square-foot retail and office center around the home. She died in 2008 and willed her house to a construction superintendent she had befriended. He sold the house in 2009.The company that now owns the boarded-up house owes nearly $186,000 and, unless the debt is paid off, the property will be auctioned on March 13, newspaper website Seattlepi.com reported, citing a foreclosure notice. Publicists in 2009 tied a cluster of balloons to the little two-story bungalow in Seattle in a marketing stunt for ""Up,"" about a curmudgeonly old man who refuses to sell his home and flies off in the house tied to balloons. The display fell flat, however, as many of the balloons popped after being driven into surrounding walls by winds and it never achieved its intended aesthetic, Seattlepi.com reported. The movie, by Disney-Pixar, made more than $700 million at worldwide box offices and won an Oscar for the best animated movie in 2010. Newspaper photos from earlier this week show the home wrapped in a graffiti-streaked fence wedged between the soaring modern building.  (Reporting by Eric M.

331,"   By Lisa Richwine | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES The Walt Disney Co has started work on a sequel to ""Frozen,"" the best-selling animated movie of all time and a global merchandising phenomenon that helped push the media giant to record profits.Directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee are returning for the sequel, Disney said on Thursday. No release date was set for the follow-up to ""Frozen"", a surprise smash in 2013 that brought in nearly $1.3 billion in global ticket sales.Disney also said it will release the eighth episode in the ""Star Wars"" sci-fi film series on May 26, 2017. A spinoff film called ""Rogue One"" debuts on Dec. 16, 2016, shortly after the release of highly anticipated seventh episode, ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens.""The company made the announcements at its annual shareholder meeting in San Francisco, where investors re-elected 10 board members including Chief Executive Bob Iger and defeated a proposal to split the roles of CEO and chairman.The news of a ""Frozen"" sequel comes hours before short film ""Frozen Fever"" opens for Disney's live-action ""Cinderella"" movie, which debuts Friday. ""We enjoyed making 'Frozen Fever' so much and being back in that world with those characters,"" said John Lasseter, chief creative officer for Walt Disney Animation Studios and Pixar Animation Studios. ""Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck have come up with a great idea for a sequel.""   Lasseter spoke alongside Josh Gad, who provided the voice of the snowman Olaf in ""Frozen."" Iger said Olaf will appear in the second film. ""Frozen"" tells the story of two royal sisters, Anna and Elsa, in an icy Nordic kingdom. Kristen Bell voices Anna, and Idina Menzel is Elsa.On ""Star Wars,"" Iger said ""Rogue One"" will star Oscar best actress nominee Felicity Jones. British director Gareth Edwards, who did the ""Godzilla"" remake, had previously been announced as director of the spin-off.""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is one of the most anticipated films of the year, directed by J.J. Abrams and starring returning franchise stars Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher and newcomers Oscar Isaac and Lupita Nyong'o. Two shareholder proposals were rejected at the meeting, according to preliminary tallies. One would have required that future CEOs be prevented from also holding the title of chairman, as Iger does now. A second proposal would have placed limits on accelerated executive pay.Disney shares rose 3.9 percent to $106.78 on the New York Stock Exchange and are up 25 percent in the past year.

332,"  * Wall St coming off extended decline* Bank stocks higher after Fed stress tests* Intel shares fall after lowered outlook* Indexes up: Dow 1.5 pct, S&P 1.3 pct, Nasdaq 0.9 pct   (Updates close with latest volume, Disney, Mattel shares up)By Caroline ValetkevitchNEW YORK, March 12 U.S. stocks rose in a broad rally on Thursday, bouncing back from two days of losses, helped by weaker retail sales that paused the dollar's recent rally and tempered the outlook for interest rates.The day's gains lifted the Dow and S&P 500 back into positive territory for the year so far. Banking shares rallied following the Federal Reserve's annual check-up on the industry's health. The S&P financial sector rose 2.2 percent and was the day's biggest gainer. A weak outlook from Intel, however, limited gains in the tech sector.Retail sales unexpectedly dropped for a third month in February, which helped the euro rebound from a 12-year low versus the dollar. Recent weakness in stocks has largely been driven by Friday's stronger-than-expected jobs data, which underscored views the Fed could raise rates as early as June.""To me, it shows maybe that moving the rate increase closer has potential fallout with regard to the ever-stronger U.S. dollar, and that's a headwind for growth and a headwind for earnings for a lot of companies that do business outside the U.S.,"" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 259.83 points, or 1.47 percent, to 17,895.22, while the S&P 500 gained 25.71 points, or 1.26 percent, to 2,065.95. The day's percentage gains were the biggest for both the Dow and S&P 500 in about a month.The Nasdaq Composite added 43.35 points, or 0.89 percent, to 4,893.29.The rally represented just a partial rebound after a recent bout of weakness, which has left the S&P 500 down 2.4 percent from its March 2 record closing high. Citigroup passed in the Fed review, allowing it to raise dividends and sending shares up 3.3 percent to $54.08. Bank of America was told to get a better grip on internal controls and its data models; shares slipped 0.1 percent to $16.09.Intel Corp slashed its first-quarter revenue forecast, citing lower-than-expected demand for business PCs and lower inventory levels across the PC supply chain.  Shares of the Dow component fell 4.7 percent to $30.80 and limited the Nasdaq's advance.Shares of Walt Disney Co rose 4.2 percent to $107.17 and were the biggest percentage gainer in the Dow after it said it has started work on a sequel to ""Frozen,"" the best-selling animated movie of all time. Shares of Mattel gained 4.2 percent to $25.65.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 2,241 to 823, for a 2.72-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,982 issues rose and 765 fell, a 2.59-to-1 ratio.The S&P 500 index posted 22 new 52-week highs and 8 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 136 new highs and 73 new lows.About 6.5 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.6 billion average for the month to date, according to data from BATS Global Markets.

338,"  Walt Disney Co CEO Bob Iger learned that Steve Jobs' cancer had returned less than an hour before Disney announced it was buying Jobs' Pixar studio in 2006, and Iger kept the Apple co-founder's condition a secret for three years, according to Bloomberg, citing a new biography of Jobs.Iger told the authors of ""Becoming Steve Jobs"" he thought about the implications of keeping such a secret at a time when regulators were calling for more disclosure and holding executives more accountable to their fiduciary duties, Bloomberg reported.The $7 billion deal to buy Pixar made Jobs Disney's largest shareholder and put him on the entertainment company's board. Iger decided that Disney was assessing the transaction on the value of Pixar, not Jobs, and his medical condition did not need to be disclosed, the biography said.Iger said Jobs told him that the cancer had returned while they were on a private walk at Pixar's Emeryville, California, campus about 30 minutes before the deal was to be announced. ""Frankly, they tell me I’ve got a 50-50 chance of living five years,"" Iger quoted Jobs as saying. According to the book, Iger said he told Jobs: ""You’re our largest shareholder, but I don’t think that makes this matter. You’re not material to this deal. We’re buying Pixar, we’re not buying you."" Jobs was diagnosed with a rare form of pancreatic cancer in 2003 and underwent surgery the following year. The tumor returned and he had a liver transplant in 2009. Jobs died in October 2011.The book, which will be published on Tuesday, paints a more sympathetic picture than the 2011 biography by Walter Isaacson, who devoted several passages in his book to Jobs’ messy personal life and mercurial temperament, Bloomberg said.

340,"   By Barbara Liston | ORLANDO, Fla.  ORLANDO, Fla. A passenger killed in a crash at a Walt Disney World Speedway race-car attraction has been identified as an instructor who was riding in a Lamborghini that hit a guardrail after the driver lost control, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.The instructor was 36-year-old Gary Terry, a senior operations manager at Exotic Driving Experience, the highway patrol said. Terry, who lived in Davenport a few miles south-west of Orlando, died at the scene on Sunday.The driver, Tavon Watson, 24, of Kissimmee, who was taking the ride as a 24th birthday treat, suffered only minor injuries.The estimated speed of the crash was 100 mph (160 kph), according to the highway patrol.     The Exotic Driving Experience attraction is offered by North Carolina-based Petty Holdings, which markets products licensed under the name of retired NASCAR stock car racer Richard Petty. No racing experience is required to drive one of the exotic cars, which also include Ferraris, Audis, Nissans and Porsches, according to the attraction's website. Maximum speeds vary depending on the driver's experience, location and other factors.A professional driving instructor provides coaching and feedback from the passenger seat, according to the website.“There are no pedals or steering wheel (on the instructor’s side of the car),” said spokeswoman Lauren Swoboda. “There’s a throttle control.” The FHP reported both men were wearing lap and seat belts, as well as helmets, in the Super Leggera Lamborghini.""Yesterday we lost a long-time, valued team member of the Exotic Driving Experience family,"" the company said in a statement on Monday. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with Gary’s family and friends. He will be sorely missed,"" it added.The company also announced the attraction would remain closed Monday and Tuesday.Unrelated to the fatal accident, the Driving Experience, which opened in January 2012 at the Walt Disney World Speedway, is scheduled to close on Aug. 9.

342,"  (Adds forecast, background)By Shailaja SharmaApril 16 Mattel Inc's quarterly net sales topped analysts' estimates for the first time in six quarters as new Chief Executive Christopher Sinclair focuses on turning around the business in the face of flagging sales of Barbie dolls.Mattel's shares rose 6.6 percent to $26.94 in aftermarket trading on Thursday. They have lost more than a third of their value in the past 12 months.The toymaker reported a 2.5 percent decline in net sales in the three months ended March 31, during which Sinclair was appointed as interim CEO. He took the post permanently this month.Worldwide sales of Barbie dolls fell 5 percent on a constant currency basis, while sales of Fisher-Price preschool toys rose 3 percent. Sinclair, a former PepsiCo Inc executive who has been on Mattel's board since 1996, has said the company needs to move with a ""sense of urgency"" to create toys that connect with young customers.""The board and I don't want to waste time in moving forward with the necessary changes to revitalize the business... We certainly were too slow to adapt and react to rapidly changing technology and competitive landscape,"" Sinclair said on a post-earnings conference call on Thursday.Barbie dolls, which have been around for 56 years, have been losing ground to electronic toys, tablets and merchandise based on popular films such as Disney's ""Frozen"". Mattel also faces intense competition from rivals such as Denmark's Lego Group and U.S.-based Hasbro Inc, which have been growing sales despite weak consumer spending and high competition.Analysts, however, do not expect Mattel's sales to return to growth before 2016, when it loses the license to make Walt Disney Co's Disney Princess dolls, including those based on the movie ""Frozen"". Hasbro has won the license. But for this year, its sales are expected to receive a boost from sequels to ""Star Wars"", ""The Avengers"" and ""Jurassic Park"".A strong dollar will hurt Mattel's revenue growth by 4-6 percent and earnings by 30-35 cents per share in 2015, Sinclair said.Net loss attributable to Mattel widened to $58.2 million, or 17 cents per share, in the first quarter from $11.2 million, or 3 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, the loss was 8 cents per share. Sales were to $922.7 million.Analysts on average had expected a loss of 9 cents per share on revenue of $901.3 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

343,"  (Adds Verizon comments)By Lisa Richwine and Malathi NayakApril 22 Verizon Communications Inc acted on its own when the company decided how to offer ESPN and other Walt Disney Co channels in smaller custom TV packages, a spokeswoman for ESPN said on Wednesday.Disney, Comcast Corp's NBCUniversal and 21st Century Fox have said Verizon's slimmer TV bundles violate existing agreements. The new offerings let customers sign up for a slimmed-down, cheaper bundle of 36 fixed channels through Verizon's FiOS TV and add on genre-specific packages such as kids, sports or news.""The issue here is that Verizon made unilateral decisions on how to offer ABC Family, Disney Channels, ESPN and ESPN2 that are in violation of our existing agreements,"" the spokeswoman said. Disney has teamed with other distributors on new TV packages. It made a landmark deal last year to include its programming on Dish Network Corp's Sling TV, a smaller channel bundle delivered over the Internet.""The Walt Disney Company is at the forefront of working with distributors to create new and innovative consumer offerings,"" the ESPN spokeswoman said.

344,"   By Malathi Nayak and Lisa Richwine | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Verizon Communications Inc said on Thursday that Walt Disney Co and Twenty-First Century Fox are not running ads promoting the wireless carrier's recently launched FiOS Custom TV service on its channels in the New York market.Since Verizon unveiled its cheaper, slimmer pay-TV plan on Sunday, Disney, Comcast Corp's NBCUniversal and 21st Century Fox have pushed back and said Verizon's FiOS TV was violating existing agreements. A Verizon spokeswoman said Disney was refusing to run the Custom TV ads on channels such as ABC and ESPN in New York. Fox did the same in New York, specifically on its stations WNYW and YES Network, she added. An ESPN spokeswoman on Thursday said, ""The issue here is that Verizon unilaterally decided"" how to offer Disney-owned channels ABC Family, the Disney Channels, ESPN 1 and ESPN 2 on the Custom TV service.  When Verizon kicked off its marketing campaign on Tuesday, the Verizon spokeswoman said, an ESPN radio spot did not go on air and a video ad that was expected to run was not shown on ABC's local New York affiliate channel. However, Disney did run Custom TV ads in Washington, D.C., Boston and Pittsburgh, she added.   Verizon's new pay-TV plan lets customers sign up for a slimmed-down, cheaper bundle of 36 fixed channels through its FiOS TV and then add on genre-specific packages such as kids, sports or news. It hopes the flexibility will lure them away from cable rivals and upstart online TV companies.""Disney's anti-competitive tactic is only hurting the consumer,"" Verizon's spokeswoman said.

347,"   By Jennifer Saba and Malathi Nayak  ESPN sued Verizon Communications (VZ.N) on Monday for breach of contract involving a new pay TV offering, as the cable sports network fired the latest volley in a mounting battle with the telecommunications company.ESPN, a unit of Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), said in a legal document sent to the Supreme Court of New York State that Verizon violated its obligations ""under certain license agreements"" and it wants Verizon to pay.The dispute involves Verizon's new pay TV plan, offering consumers a slimmer package of channels targeting genre-specific packages such as sports, kids or news. In traditional subscriptions, customers pay for a large group of networks that often include ESPN.ESPN and other media companies with a lot of sports content say the package violates their contracts with Verizon. A Verizon spokesman said the company is in compliance of existing agreements. ""Consumers have spoken loud and clear that they want choice and the industry should be focused on what the consumer wants and giving them what they want,"" A Verizon spokesman said. ESPN said in a statement, ""ESPN is at the forefront of embracing innovative ways to deliver high-quality content and value to consumers on multiple platforms, but that must be done in compliance with our agreements.  We simply ask that Verizon abide by the terms of our contracts.""Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) and Comcast's (CMCSA.O) NBC Universal also said last week that the new Verizon offering violated the terms of their contracts. It was unclear whether Fox and NBC planned to follow ESPN's lead and file suit.A spokeswoman for NBC declined to comment. A spokesman for Fox was not immediately available to comment.

361,"   By Lisa Richwine | ANAHEIM, California  ANAHEIM, California The mobile technology that helps Walt Disney Co theme park guests beat lines and pay for Mickey Mouse ears at the company's flagship resort in Florida will expand in some form to other Disney resorts, Chief Operating Officer Tom Staggs said.   The $1 billion MyMagic+ program features wristbands and a mobile app that let Walt Disney World visitors unlock hotel room doors, pay for food and merchandise, and book dinner reservations or ride times. The technology aims to help people plan trips in advance, move more quickly through the park and personalize visits. More than 11 million wristbands, called MagicBands, have been used. ""The folks who are saying the MyMagic+ experience is excellent is the vast, vast majority of folks who are using it, and that, we know, is good for our business,"" Staggs said on Thursday.Staggs spoke in an interview on the patio of an apartment once occupied by Walt Disney at the Disneyland Resort, which is celebrating its 60th anniversary this year.The executive ran the Disney parks and resorts division from 2010 until his promotion in February to chief operating officer, which put him in the lead to succeed Chief Executive Bob Iger in 2018.  The parks unit's earnings have climbed over the past few years as Disney invested billions to add Cars Land at the Anaheim resort, expanded Fantasyland at Walt Disney World, built a new cruise ship and made other improvements. For the six months that ended March 28, operating income rose 22 percent to $1.4 billion. It is Disney's second-largest division.  Adding new technology is one way Disney aims to keep the business growing.   ""We will bring variations on MyMagic+ to our parks and other businesses around the world,"" Staggs said. He said it was ""possible"" the use of the MagicBands will be enabled at parks outside of Walt Disney World. The company also is exploring if other wearable technology could offer some of the same functions as consumers adopt new products such as the Apple Watch. ""We are really open to doing that,"" Staggs said, though he said there were no plans specifically for the Apple Watch. As part of its 60th anniversary, Disneyland is unveiling new night-time entertainment including a fireworks show that adds projections inside the park. Classic characters such as Mickey will appear along with new ones such as Anna and Elsa from blockbuster movie ""Frozen,"" part of Disney's strategy of bringing its hit franchises into the parks.

362,"  NEW YORK Walt Disney Co could climb 50 percent over the next three years on its uncanny ability to generate profits from its businesses including movies, merchandise and parks and cruise lines, Barron's said in its latest edition published on Sunday.Wall Street analysts forecast the Burbank, California-based entertainment and media company will grow its earnings per share by 16 percent this year to $5.03 and 13 percent next year to $5.67. This put Disney's stock price at 18 times earnings, the financial weekly said.On Friday, Disney shares closed at $110.37, about $3 below its high set on May 5. This compared with the $165 Barron's said they could achieve by 2018.Analysts anticipate a string of box office hits over the next few years including the seventh installation of the ""Star Wars"" saga by the end of this year, according to Barron's. Shanghai Disney, which is set open next spring, should score handsomely for the company's parks and resorts division. Disney is a 43 percent owner of the park, while Chinese firms own the rest, Barron's said.It hasn't been all smooth sailing for Disney.  Its ""Tomorrowland"" took in $32.2 million in its opening weekend at the movie box last weekend, falling short of expectations.The Internet has cut into its television ratings, Barron's added. ""These seem offset by potential rewards. Few companies right now have more or bigger likely winners on the horizon,"" the paper said.

372,"   By Lisa Richwine | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Walt Disney Co's interactive unit is considering bringing Disney Infinity or other video games into the world of virtual reality.Adapting elements of current titles is one option the company is exploring, James Pitaro, president of Disney Interactive, said in an interview. Disney also might create new games specifically for VR or for another emerging platform known as augmented reality, he said.Virtual reality headsets offer a 360-degree view that immerses players in fantasy settings, while augmented reality projects computer images onto real-world settings. The technology has been touted for decades but never reached mass adoption, and the entertainment industry is debating whether it will take off this time.Disney Infinity, which has achieved $1 billion in global retail sales, mixes characters from Disney, Pixar and Marvel franchises. Star Wars will come to the new edition set for release this fall. The game includes a ""toy box"" mode allowing  players to mix backdrops and characters from different franchises.  ""You could easily imagine a scenario where we were to expand the toy box component of Infinity into AR or VR,"" Pitaro said in an interview at the E3 video game conference, although he added Disney does not have that project or any other VR projects in development.Disney is talking to the VR ""platforms,"" he said, without specifying which companies. Facebook Inc's Oculus unit, Sony Corp and other companies will offer modern VR headsets to consumers later this year and next year. Microsoft Corp generated buzz at E3 with a demonstration of its HoloLens AR headset using the Minecraft game. Pitaro said he was impressed with recent VR technology and was enthusiastic about its possibilities. ""I do not think this is going to be a fad,"" Pitaro said.Some other companies showed VR prototypes at E3. Ubisoft, for example, demonstrated an experience that features its Rabbids characters and makes viewers feel like they're riding a roller coaster.

374,"   By Barbara Liston | ORLANDO, Fla.  ORLANDO, Fla. Walt Disney Co will ban selfie sticks starting next week at its theme parks around the world, the company said on Friday, joining a growing list of attractions that restrict the camera accessories for safety reasons.Beginning Tuesday, the company will not allow selfie sticks - extension rods used for taking self-portraits with smartphones - at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, or Disneyland in Anaheim, California. The ban will begin on Wednesday at parks in Hong Kong and Paris.“We strive to provide a great experience for the entire family, and unfortunately selfie sticks have become a growing safety concern for both our guests and cast,” Disney spokeswoman Kim Prunty said in a statement. Disney tried allowing selfie sticks in the park but not on rides, according to Prunty. But violators were forcing park staff to stop rides for extended periods of time, including on Wednesday when a roller coaster was shut down at Disneyland, frustrating other guests.Starting next week, security personnel will ask Disney guests who arrive with selfie sticks at the parks to stow them at a storage facility or return the sticks to their hotels or cars, the company said. Major museums worldwide, including those in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, have banned the sticks. Other major tourist destinations such as the Palace of Versailles outside of Paris and the Colosseum in Rome as well as music festivals such as Coachella and Lollapalooza have also prohibited them.Universal Studios also bans selfie sticks on rides in its parks, spokesman Tom Schroder said  SeaWorld Entertainment Inc allows selfie sticks in the company's parks but not on rides or over animal habitats, spokeswoman Becca Bides said.

375,"   By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Investors who have the most to win if Amazon, Disney and other consumer discretionary companies continue to push the sector higher are getting increasingly nervous, judging by their options activity.Options bets tied to declines in an exchange-traded fund tracking the sector have been unusually popular, even as the S&P 500 consumer discretionary index has logged an 8 percent rise for the year, handily beating the S&P 500 and turning in the second-best performance among the nine S&P 500 sectors.Earlier in June, the open interest in puts on the consumer discretionary sector ETF touched highs not seen since October 2011. Currently there are two put contracts open for each open call, the most bearish this ratio has been in nine months.Open interest in puts has more than doubled to about 303,000 contracts over the last three months, compared with an 18 percent drop in calls, according to Trade Alert data.    Puts are option contracts that convey the right to sell shares at a predetermined price in the future and are often used to place bearish bets on shares.    But in this case, the surge in puts activity may not be signaling outright bearish sentiment.    “I think it’s more of a hedge,” said Scott Elisha, chief options strategist at Perigon Partners in San Francisco.Elisha was looking in particular at puts betting on the ETF's shares dipping below $75 by mid-July, which at over 90,0000 contracts represents the biggest block of open interest in the ETF's near-term options. The ETF's shares were up 41 cents at $78 on Friday. There are another 82,0000 put contracts open at the $69 and $74 strike prices and these expire in September.“The (ETF's) shares are up about 8 percent this year and with July earnings around the corner, and big names set to report results, it looks like investors might have been picking up some protection,” Elisha said.The ETF touched an all-time high of $78.30 on Wednesday, and the low cost of buying downside protection might be the driving factor behind the increased hedging activity, suggested Susquehanna derivatives strategist Christopher Jacobson. For example, the cost of 3-month 10 percent out-of-the-money XLY puts is now cheaper than it has been 95 percent of the time over the last five years, he said.  The appetite for cheap protection is understandable given that a lot of active managers are overweight the sector, strategists said.Investors taking a longer-term view might also be concerned about the impact from the looming U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hike.“The sector typically under-performs when the Fed raises rates,” said Jill Carey Hall, equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, who is underweight the consumer discretionary sector.The Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade in September. “Investors could just be starting to pay more attention to that,” Hall said.The threat of higher wages putting pressure on margins might also be on investor's minds. A number of big retailers and national chains, including McDonald's - one of the top five constituents of the ETF - have been raising wages of late.""Given that the sector is labor intensive there could be concerns about this hurting margins,"" Hall said.Recent corporate results, however, at two of the ETF's top ten constituents, - Walt Disney Co's and Nike Inc - have been strong, helped by increased consumer spending, and bode well for quarterly results from McDonald's, Amazon.com Inc and Starbucks Corp, due in July.

389,"  (Recasts with share drop, lowered guidance)By Lisa Richwine and Arathy S NairAug 4 Walt Disney Co lowered profit guidance for its cable networks unit and reported quarterly revenue slightly below Wall Street forecasts, sending its shares down 6 percent on Tuesday.The media company now expects annual operating income growth at the unit in the mid-single digits for fiscal years 2013 to 2016, Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy said on a conference call. It previously had forecast growth in the high single digits.The company cut its forecast because it expects lower revenue from a decline in subscribers and the impact of foreign exchange rates, McCarthy said. Sports network ESPN has experienced ""modest"" subscriber losses as viewing habits have shifted to digital platforms, Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger said.Walt Disney shares dropped 6 percent to $114.10 in after-hours trading. The reduced guidance and revenue miss likely sparked the decline, said Edward Jones analyst Robin Diedrich. ""That's where some of the concern lies,"" Diedrich said of the cable outlook. Overall, the company produced ""a good solid quarter.""Disney posted record profit in the June quarter, but its revenue missed Wall Street expectations for the first time in two years. It had net income of $2.48 billion, up 11 percent from a year earlier, and revenue of $13.1 billion, just shy of the $13.23 billion projected by industry analysts.The weaker euro cut revenue at the Disneyland Paris theme park by about $100 million, McCarthy said.

399,"   By Lisa Richwine | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Aug 5 Walt Disney Co has acknowledged that even powerhouse network ESPN and its live sports programming are not insulated from the massive changes shaking up the television landscape, confirming warnings from skeptics.The entertainment giant's frank admission raised questions about whether the pace of ""cord cutting,"" or dropping of pay TV service, will hasten.""There has been this enormous run with ESPN without any speed bumps of any kind over the last decade,"" said Marc Ganis, president of SportsCorp, a sports business consulting firm. ""Now there is a disruption in the flight path.""Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger said on Tuesday that ESPN has seen ""modest"" declines in subscribers as viewers move to cheaper digital platforms. He would not be more specific but he defended the network's ability to navigate the shifts.It did not convince some investors as Disney shares dropped 9.2 percent to $110.53 on Wednesday after the company warned that subscriber losses as well as currency impacts will hit profits.Some Wall Street analysts are also concerned about ESPN's rising costs for sports rights as pay TV comes under pressure from new players. In a note to clients, Nomura Securities International said, ""ESPN and cable ecosystem-related fears may become marginally greater concerns in the minds of investors, this despite the power of the ESPN brand and, what we believe to be its ability to benefit from new online and direct-to-consumer monetization potential.""Disney executives are realists about the impact of technology and changing viewing habits, particularly among younger audiences, Iger said. But he said he expected the expanded basic cable package with ESPN and hundreds of other channels to ""remain the dominant package of choice for some years to come.""Iger said he does not plan to take any radical steps in the near term to sell ESPN online. He also stressed that live viewing on ESPN remains strong. On TV, 83 percent of households tuned in to ESPN at some point during the first quarter of the year. ESPN has rights to major sporting events locked up for years.Live sports are one of the few types of programming that still draw massive audiences at one time, making them valuable to advertisers. And for many customers, sports is the reason they keep their pay TV subscriptions.""All this adds up to a very strong hand and gives us enormous confidence in ESPN's future no matter how technology disrupts the media business,"" Iger said. Some analysts agreed. ""Their claim on audiences that advertisers want to get in front of - people that watch big, live sporting events - is very strong,"" said Barton Crockett, analyst at FBR Capital Markets.Iger, speaking on the company's quarterly conference call, said 80 percent of ESPN's customer losses came from a reduction in the number of households that subscribe to pay TV, and only a small percentage from customers taking slimmer channel bundles.SNL Kagan estimates ESPN will average 94.6 million subscribers this year, down from 98.8 million in 2012.Iger said Disney's contracts provide flexibility to sell channels directly to consumers if the marketplace changes.

400,"   By Lisa Richwine | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Walt Disney Co has acknowledged that even powerhouse network ESPN and its live sports programming are not insulated from the massive changes shaking up the television landscape, confirming warnings from skeptics.The entertainment giant's frank admission raised questions about whether the pace of ""cord cutting,"" or dropping of pay TV service, will hasten.""There has been this enormous run with ESPN without any speed bumps of any kind over the last decade,"" said Marc Ganis, president of SportsCorp, a sports business consulting firm. ""Now there is a disruption in the flight path.""Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger said on Tuesday that ESPN has seen ""modest"" declines in subscribers as viewers move to cheaper digital platforms. He would not be more specific but he defended the network's ability to navigate the shifts.It did not convince some investors as Disney shares dropped 9.2 percent to $110.53 on Wednesday after the company warned that subscriber losses as well as currency impacts will hit profits.Some Wall Street analysts are also concerned about ESPN's rising costs for sports rights as pay TV comes under pressure from new players.In a note to clients, Nomura Securities International said, ""ESPN and cable ecosystem-related fears may become marginally greater concerns in the minds of investors, this despite the power of the ESPN brand and, what we believe to be its ability to benefit from new online and direct-to-consumer monetization potential.""    Disney executives are realists about the impact of technology and changing viewing habits, particularly among younger audiences, Iger said. But he said he expected the expanded basic cable package with ESPN and hundreds of other channels to ""remain the dominant package of choice for some years to come.""Iger said he does not plan to take any radical steps in the near term to sell ESPN online.He also stressed that live viewing on ESPN remains strong. On TV, 83 percent of households tuned in to ESPN at some point during the first quarter of the year. ESPN has rights to major sporting events locked up for years.  Live sports are one of the few types of programming that still draw massive audiences at one time, making them valuable to advertisers. And for many customers, sports is the reason they keep their pay TV subscriptions. ""All this adds up to a very strong hand and gives us enormous confidence in ESPN's future no matter how technology disrupts the media business,"" Iger said.Some analysts agreed. ""Their claim on audiences that advertisers want to get in front of - people that watch big, live sporting events - is very strong,"" said Barton Crockett, analyst at FBR Capital Markets.Iger, speaking on the company's quarterly conference call, said 80 percent of ESPN's customer losses came from a reduction in the number of households that subscribe to pay TV, and only a small percentage from customers taking slimmer channel bundles. SNL Kagan estimates ESPN will average 94.6 million subscribers this year, down from 98.8 million in 2012.Iger said Disney's contracts provide flexibility to sell channels directly to consumers if the marketplace changes. The company is testing new approaches, such as putting ESPN on Dish Network Corp's $20-a-month Sling TV package. Ganis, who believes ESPN is well-positioned to weather the industry's shifts, applauded the company for looking for ways to adapt.

Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger wrote in a note. ""But today is not just any day. Today is the day after Disney spooked the sector with their comments that cord-cutting is worse than they thought.""Disney cut its profit forecast for its cable networks unit on Tuesday, citing a decline in subscribers. The company's shares fell about 10 percent on Wednesday. Time Warner and Disney are remodeling their businesses to grab a larger share of the video-streaming market as consumers increasingly take to watching television shows online, a trend dubbed as ""cord cutting"".In April, Time Warner's Turner division, owner of channels such as CNN and TNT, granted exclusive subscription video-on-demand rights for its programs from Cartoon Network and Adult Swim to Hulu.Time Warner also launched its own standalone streaming service, HBO Now, in the same month. Less than 1 percent of HBO's cable subscribers had switched to HBO Now, HBO CEO Richard Plepler said on a post-earnings conference call.Time Warner's revenue rose 8 percent to $7.35 billion, helped by its Turner division and Warner Bros. studio, which together make up more than 80 percent of the total revenue.The rest comes from Time Warner's HBO network, which airs the hit medieval fantasy series ""Game of Thrones"".Excluding items, the company earned $1.25 per share, well above the $1.03 analysts had expected.Time Warner's shares were down 7.5 percent at $81.07 in afternoon trading.

408,"   By Tim McLaughlin and David Randall  U.S. media stocks have taken an indiscriminate beating this week, but many big fund managers still like entertainment conglomerate Walt Disney Co while turning negative for the long term on Discovery Communications, owner of several niche television franchises.Shares of leading media stocks slid again on Thursday as investors sorted winners and losers. Television advertising has been drying up as consumers downsize or eliminate expensive cable TV packages and watch more programs on mobile devices. The stock decline, fanned by a slew of disappointing financial reports, hurt a number of U.S. funds this week. Portfolio manager Don Yacktman has seen the performance of both his $11.2 billion Yacktman Fund and the $7.6 billion Yacktman Focused fund tumble into the 98th percentile of their Morningstar peers.Along with 7.7 million shares of Viacom Inc spread between those two funds, Yacktman owns about 30 million shares of Twenty-First Century Fox, down about 22 percent for the year. Viacom is off 22 percent this week and down nearly 45 percent over the past 12 months. Yacktman did not respond to a request for comment.Shares of Disney are off nearly 10 percent this week amid concerns that its leading sports channel franchise ESPN is losing subscribers. Disney Chairman and Chief Executive Jeff Iger admitted to ""modest losses"" during a conference call with analysts and investors this week. But he said cable packages are not dead and ESPN will still be the centerpiece of any offering. Pound for pound, the $866 million Fidelity Select Multimedia Portfolio has one of the biggest bets on Disney's future, with 24 percent of its assets in the stock at the end of June, fund disclosures show. As a result, the fund is down 4.2 percent this week, underperforming nearly all of its peers, according to Morningstar Inc. But thanks in part to Disney, the fund's three-year average annual total return of 21.76 percent is better than 83 percent of peers.  Portfolio manager Nidhi Gupta was not available for comment, but earlier this year declared Disney the ""clear winner among the content providers."" Like many other fund managers, Gupta has soured on Discovery Communications, hard hit by the consumer shift to watching Internet-based content. Discovery shares are down 7 percent this week and down 29 percent over the past 12 months.Fund managers began unloading large blocks of Discovery early last year. Fidelity's behemoth Contrafund had a $1 billion stake in Discovery in early 2014.

Viacom fell 14.22 percent to its lowest in almost four years after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly revenue due to weakness in its cable TV business. Walt Disney  was off 1.79 percent and down for a second session after it lowered profit guidance for its cable networks unit on Tuesday.The S&P 500 media index lost 2.12 percent and notched its biggest two-day fall since November 2008, with Time Warner, Comcast and CBS all in the red and Twenty-First Century Fox down 6.4 percent.""All the media stocks are down and it seems people just want to get out of the sector at any cost and take any loss,"" CLSA analyst Vasily Karasyov said.Viacom's results and Disney's warning put the spotlight on a trend of viewers shifting from cable TV to Internet-based services such as Netflix, which rose 2.21 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.69 percent to end at 17,419.75 and the S&P 500 lost 0.78 percent to 2,083.56. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.62 percent to 5,056.44, its biggest one-day tumble since early July.Eight of the 10 major S&P sectors were lower, with the health index's 2.09 percent fall leading the decliners. Allergan fell 5.1 percent after the Irish drugmaker reported a second-quarter loss.In other earnings-driven stock moves, Tesla fell 8.88 percent and Keurig Green Mountain slumped as much as 29.75 percent after reporting disappointing numbers.Investors were also jittery ahead of the release of U.S. non-farm payroll numbers, which are expected to have risen by 223,000 in July, matching gains in June.

""Star Wars"" is being transported from a galaxy far, far away to California and Florida after Walt Disney Co announced on Saturday it was developing two new expansions at its theme parks that will bring the celebrated film franchise to life.The new 14-acre ""Star Wars"" land, the largest themed land to be part of Anaheim, California's Disneyland and Orlando, Florida's Disney World, will introduce a new planet from George Lucas' intergalactic film saga.It will also feature two new rides, including one where participants will be able to take control of the Millennium Falcon spaceship, as well as the Cantina, the infamous hub of rogue smugglers and traders in the films.A date for the opening of the new attractions was not given, and Disney did not comment on the cost of the expansions. The new lands will hope to harness the avid fanbase of ""Star Wars,"" which first came out in 1977 and has since become embedded into U.S. pop culture.The announcement, made by Disney Chief Executive and Chairman Bob Iger at the annual D23 Exposition in Anaheim on Saturday, comes as fans gear up for the first installment of a new trilogy of ""Star Wars"" films, kicking off with December's ""The Force Awakens.""Harrison Ford, who reprises the role of Han Solo, was welcomed to the convention stage with a standing ovation and led the cast of the new film, including Oscar-winner Lupita Nyong'o and British newcomer John Boyega. ""It's a great thing to be here with you, who made this whole thing happen. I couldn't be happier,"" Ford said to the room of 7,500 fans. Outside of ""Star Wars,"" Disney harnessed star talent to drum up buzz for its other live-action films. Johnny Depp swaggered through the hall dressed as his ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" character Captain Jack Sparrow, as fans were told that Orlando Bloom's character, Will Turner, will return for 2017's fifth installment of the swash-buckling franchise, ""Dead Men Tell No Tales."" Chris Evans presented the third installment of his Marvel superhero franchise, 2016's ""Captain America: Civil War,"" and fans were shown an action-filled clip.

429,"   By Jessica Toonkel  Aug 27 CBS Radio and Walt Disney's  ESPN are joining a handful of companies that will promote podcasts to advertisers at the Interactive Advertising Bureau's first podcast upfronts next month, executives told Reuters.As consumers increasingly use mobile devices for content,  media companies are turning to podcasts for potential revenue with advertisers often paying a premium for them.Podcasts are a small, but growing part of the digital media marketplace with a wealthy, tech-savvy group of listeners, said Larry Rosin, president of Edison Research, a Somerville, New Jersey-based market research firm that serves media companies.""They are more likely to have the tools and toys that make downloading podcasts easier,"" Rosin said.While media companies and investors are concerned about viewers turning away from traditional television, 17 percent of teens and adults listened to at least one podcast per month, up from 15 percent last year, according to Edison Research. Television broadcasters developed upfronts or a group of meetings to promote new shows and lock in commitments from advertisers, and over the past few years IAB developed the ""Newfronts,"" which are upfronts for the digital video industry.Now IAB is testing out if there is a market for podcast upfronts, said IAB Vice President Carl Kalapesi. Many of the most popular podcasts, such as the recent ""Serial"" series are from non-profits, but commercial podcasts are growing.CBS Corp's local digital media unit this year launched original content podcasts including pro wrestling talk show ""WOOOOO! Nation"" in a new division, play.it. Its audience rose 30 percent since January and revenue is up double digits, said division president Ezra Kucharz.ESPN is seeing digital and traditional radio growth, said     Traug Keller, ESPN senior vice president of production business divisions. This comes at a time when ESPN is seeing a decline in television subscribers, a move which has unnerved many media investors.. More broadly, while traditional broadcast radio revenue overall is declining, digital radio ad spending is expected to be $2.75 billion this year, up almost 28 percent from 2014, eMarketer forecasts.Podcasts make up small double-digit millions of that figure, estimates eMarketer analyst Paul Verna. ""It's a blip on the radar... but its becoming a bigger blip,"" he said.On average, the cost that an advertiser pays for a thousand impressions, known as the CPM, of a podcast is $15 to $30, according to Midroll Media, which connects podcast shows with advertisers. Meanwhile, the average CPM for radio is in the mid-single digits, according to analysts.ESPN and CBS join NPR, WNYC, Panoply, Podtrac, AdLarge and Midroll as presenters for the IAB upfronts which will take place on Sept. 10 in New York.

438,"   By Sarah N. Lynch | WASHINGTON, Sept 8  WASHINGTON, Sept 8The U.S. Labor Department has cleared Infosys Ltd of any wrongdoing and closed its investigation after American technology workers at Southern California Edison complained their jobs were wrongfully outsourced to foreigners working on H-1B visas, Infosys has confirmed.""Infosys fully cooperated with the (Department of Labor) in this activity,"" the company told Reuters in a statement, noting the company was confident from the start that it had complied with U.S. immigration laws.The Labor Department is still investigating similar complaints by U.S. workers into Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. , a second IT firm hired by Southern California Edison, and HCL Technologies, an IT firm that Disney  hired last year as part of a restructuring of its Orlando-based IT division, a department spokesman said.H-1B visas are often used by the technology sector to bring highly skilled foreign guest workers to the U.S. Critics say the laws governing the visas are lax, and make it too easy to replace U.S. workers with cheaper, foreign labor.Separately, the Justice Department is looking at whether HCL, Tata, Infosys, Disney and Southern California Edison discriminated against U.S. workers on the basis of citizenship, according to a person familiar with the matter.The review, which may not become a formal investigation, was sparked after the Labor Department referred complaints it had received from workers. Infosys said it had not received ""any indication"" of a review by the Justice Department.The scrutiny by U.S. officials comes after the New York Times and other publications reported that laid-off American IT workers at Disney and Southern California Edison were being forced to train their H-1B replacements in order to receive severance.Tata said the company is cooperating with the Labor Department's ongoing probe and is ""fully compliant"" with U.S. immigration laws. Southern California Edison said its contracts with Infosys and Tata require both firms to follow all ""applicable laws."" Disney declined to comment on the U.S. government reviews. A spokesman said the company's IT restructuring has led to a net increase of about 70 new in-house jobs. HCL declined to comment.The lay-offs have prompted an outcry from some U.S. senators, several of whom also called for probes into abuses.Companies such as Infosys that have a workforce composed of 15 percent or more H-1B workers are required to try recruiting U.S. workers first and attest they are not displacing Americans. But they are exempt from these requirements if they pay H-1 B workers more than $60,000 or hire those with a graduate degree.Experts who have studied federal H-1B pay data say that in the vast majority of cases H-1B workers are paid more than $60,000, complicating enforcement of discrimination claims by the Justice Department or wrongful displacement at the Labor Department.Further, the Labor Department cannot launch an investigation into alleged H-1B visa abuses unless it receives a complaint from a worker or credible third party.""Qualified American workers are going to keep getting replaced by less expensive foreign workers,"" said Iowa Republican Senator Charles Grassley, one of several lawmakers planning to introduce a bill this year to bolster the Labor Department's powers.""Current law hamstrings the Labor Department so bad actors go unchecked.""",2015-09-09,DIS,"Tue Sep 8, 2015 | 8:15pm EDT",Infosys says cleared in U.S. visa probe by Labor Department,http://www.reuters.com//article/infosys-h1b-probes-idUSL1N11F00I20150909?type=companyNews
439,"   By Liz Weston | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Disney cruises can be expensive, but you do not have to choose between sailing with Mickey and sending your children to college someday.Necessarily.During peak summer and winter holiday seasons, Disney's least expensive inside staterooms can cost more than $1,000 a night for a family of four. At other times though, even desirable cabins with verandahs can be booked for less than half that amount.The $6,000 fare our family recently paid for a seven-night Caribbean cruise in late August did not feel like a steal. But the same itinerary cost twice as much for a Dec. 19 sailing.Actually, fares for the holiday cruise range from $9,700 for an inside stateroom to $31,000 for a one-bedroom concierge suite.To get a good deal on Disney Cruise Line, it helps to understand the Walt Disney Co unit's unique position in the marketplace that keeps prices high, said Carolyn Spencer Brown, editor in chief of Cruise Critic (cruisecritic.com/), a review and travel information site.While marketing heavily to families, Disney proffers a luxury experience that includes high-end, adults-only restaurants, more spacious cabins and décor that is upscale, even with all the hidden mouse ears. Disney is a much smaller player than market-dominating cruise companies such as Carnival Corp or Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd and has added capacity slowly to avoid the fire sales other lines use to move unsold cabins, Brown said. ""Disney is very conservative, very careful,"" Brown said. That means the usual bargain-hunting strategy of booking at the last minute often will not work. In fact, fares typically rise over time as the ships fill, said Adrienne Vincent-Phoenix, CEO of vacation resource site MousePlanet (mouseplanet.com) and a veteran of 20 Disney cruises. Rather than discounting fares for poorly selling cruises, Disney tends to offer ""kids sail free"" promotions or other add-ons, she said.Savvy buyers are already snapping up the least expensive and most desirable cabins for next summer, Brown said. For high-season travel, ""you need to plan at least a year in advance,"" she said.Instead, bargain hunters should consider traveling during the school year, when most families cannot. They should also seek out longer trips, especially cruises across the Atlantic or through the Panama Canal which the company uses to reposition its ships. For example, a 14-night transatlantic cruise that sails May 15 from Port Canaveral, Florida currently can be booked for as little as $1,890 per person, or $270 a night for a couple.  Note that it is now industry standard to add gratuities directly to the bill, and Disney charges $12 per person per day to cover room stewards (called hosts and hostesses) and dining room servers. That added up to $336 for our party of four.Vincent-Phoenix also suggested looking for cruises out of less popular ports such as Galveston, Texas or Miami.Several sites, including Cruise Critic and Mousesavers (mousesavers.com/), highlight Disney Cruise fares.Vincent-Phoenix recommended first-time cruisers use a travel agent to help sift through the possibilities and wrestle with logistics. She suggested looking for agencies with ""Earmark"" or ""Authorized Disney Vacation Planner"" designations, who have special training and understand the cruise line's historical pricing patterns.  Booking through a travel agent typically costs no more than booking directly with Disney, and many agencies offer incentives such as shipboard credits of a few hundred dollars to book through them. Those credits come in handy, because cruise ships offer plenty of ways to spend money on top of fares. While Disney ships do not have casinos, they do have spas with costly treatments, and therapists who push expensive products. Disney-sponsored excursions, souvenirs and professional photography packages can inflate the bill, as can the aforementioned adults-only restaurants, which charge additional amounts ranging from $35 to $85 per person.In some cases, the add-ons are worth it. We had amazing meals at the restaurants on our ship, and the week-long pass to the spa felt like a good investment at about $100 each. On the other hand, we found most of the excursions overpriced. We booked a good all-day snorkel trip at St. Martin via TripAdvisor.com for much less than Disney charged. At Castaway Cay, Disney's private island in the Bahamas, excursions are quite unnecessary.

441,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, September 14 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to The  Walt Disney Company's (Disney) offering of benchmark-sized three-, five-, and  10-year senior unsecured notes.  The Rating Outlook is Stable. Approximately  $15.3 billion of debt was outstanding as of June 27, 2015 including $2.4 billion  of commercial paper (CP). A full list of ratings follows at the end of this  release. KEY RATING DRIVERS --Disney's operating profile positions the company to generate free cash flow  (FCF) in excess of $4 billion annually, which coupled with strong liquidity and  solid credit metrics, provides the company with considerable financial  flexibility at the current ratings.  Fitch expects the company to concurrently  deploy cash for share repurchase and moderate M&A activity. --The ratings incorporate Fitch's expectation that the company's share  repurchase and M&A activity will likely exceed FCF generation.  --Disney is uniquely positioned, relative to its peers, to capitalize and  monetize its internally or externally developed franchises and brands across the  company's various business segments and platforms, which in turn strengthens the  company's operating and credit profile and provides Disney with a sustainable  competitive advantage.  --Disney's strong portfolio of cable networks, ESPN in particular, underlines  the company's ratings. Disney's operating profile benefits from the stable,  recurring, dual-stream revenue profile, high operating margin and FCF generation  characteristics attributable to its cable network business. Fitch expects this  segment will continue to generate a significant amount of Disney's cash flow. --Disney's strong asset portfolio positions the company to address the secular  threats and opportunities presented by emerging alternative distribution  platforms and continued audience fragmentation across the media and  entertainment landscape.  The ratings reflect the company's leading market positions within its core  businesses. Further, Disney has a very consistent investment strategy that is  centered on creating or acquiring intellectual property and content that is  leverageable across its various platforms (cable and broadcast network, studio,  parks and resorts, and consumer products).  Disney's operating profile positions the company to generate meaningful levels  of FCF (defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and  dividends), providing the company with considerable financial flexibility at the  current ratings. Disney's investment cycle within its Parks and Resort segment  is expected to increase capital spending to approximately $4.8 billion during  fiscal 2015 ($4.4 billion net of Shanghai Disney Resort partner contributions),  which will temporarily hamper FCF generation during fiscal 2015.  Fitch  anticipates that Disney will generate in excess of $4 billion of annual FCF  during the ratings horizon.  Fitch does not anticipate any meaningful changes to Disney's financial policy  over the ratings horizon.  We believe Disney maintains an appropriate balance  between returning capital to shareholders, in the form of dividends and share  repurchases, and investing in the strategic needs of its business. Fitch expects  that Disney will manage the level of share repurchase activity in a manner  consistent with its current ratings and acknowledges that the company's share  repurchases and M&A activity will likely exceed FCF generation.  Disney  repurchased approximately 29 million shares of its common stock for $2.8 billion  during the nine-month period ended June 27, 2015.  As of that date the company  had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 386 million additional  shares.       Disney's capital structure and credit protection metrics remain consistent and  within Fitch's expectations for the current rating. Consolidated leverage of 1x  as of the latest 12 months (LTM) period ended June 27, 2015 is in line with  fiscal year-end 2014 metrics. Going forward, Fitch believes leverage will range  between 1x and 1.4x during the ratings horizon after consideration for a modest  increase in debt levels related to the higher level of share repurchases.  Disney's strong portfolio of cable networks underlines the company's ratings,  and its operating profile continues to benefit from the stable, recurring  dual-stream revenue profile and high operating margin characteristics  attributable to its cable network business. Fitch believes there is sufficient  flexibility within the current ratings to accommodate slower affiliate fee  revenue and operating income growth within this business.  Disney's cable  networks generate the largest portion of total revenue and EBITDA, resulting in  incremental stability in the total revenue and FCF profile. Secular issues such  as the stagnant multi-channel video subscriber base and its effect on affiliate  fee revenue, rising programming costs, particularly sports programming, the  impact of foreign exchange, and Disney's ability to pass the higher costs on to  multi-channel video programming distributors (MPVDs) will remain a significant  risk to the company's operating profile. However, we believe that Disney is in a  strong position to retain pricing power going forward, as its collection of  top-tier cable networks continue to command audience and ratings and be a  must-carry for the MVPDs. In addition, Disney has, in large part, successfully  matched the tenor of its long-term sports programming rights with the terms of  its various affiliation agreements with the MVPDs.  Ratings incorporate the cyclicality of the company's businesses, particularly  Parks & Resorts (31% of Disney's revenue through the LTM June 27, 2015),  Consumer Products (9%), and the advertising portion of broadcast and cable  networks (16%). Should macroeconomic volatility return, Fitch expects these  cyclical businesses to be under renewed pressure but that the company's credit  and financial profile will likely remain within expectations for the current  ratings.  Disney is well positioned to address the secular threats and opportunities  presented by emerging alternative distribution platforms and continued audience  fragmentation across the media and entertainment landscape. The evolving media  landscape including the growing prominence of Internet-based and time shifted  television content will not have a material negative impact on Disney's credit  profile or FCF over the intermediate term. For example, approximately 71% of  ESPN's telecast hours are live and coveted by advertisers.  The live programming  blunts the effects of time-shifted viewing (96% of ESPN programming is viewed  live) and ad-skipping. Further, in Fitch's view, the proliferation of new  over-the-top entrants and methods of consumption will continue to drive more  demand for Disney's content. As to the uncertainty around the continued ability  of cable networks to pass increased programming costs on to the distributors, we  believe it poses moderate risk to cable network providers over the longer term.  Mitigants for Disney include Fitch's belief that the top-tier channels will  retain leverage with distributors going forward. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case include: --The revenue growth within the company's cable networks business (Disney's  Media Networks segment) reflects the stability of the business and expected  affiliate fee increases.  Fitch anticipates high-single-digit affiliation  revenue growth.  --Programming expenses are expected to increase by high-single to  low-double-digits driven by sports rights costs.  --Fitch assumes typical volatility within the Studio Entertainment, Parks and  Resort, and Consumer Products operating segments.   --From a margin perspective, the base case assumes modest margin expansion  within the company's Media Networks segment as retransmission revenue gains  enhance broadcast margins while cable network margins remain stable reflecting  the company's ability to grow higher margin affiliate fee revenues at a similar  pace to increasing programming costs.  Disney's investments within its Parks and  Resort segment lead to higher margins within its domestic business.  Studio  Entertainment margins remain relatively consistent. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Upward momentum to the ratings is unlikely over the intermediate term.  However, a compelling rationale for, and an explicit public commitment to, more  conservative leverage thresholds could result in upgrade consideration.  Negative: Negative rating actions are more likely to coincide with discretionary  actions of Disney's management rather than by operating performance, reflecting  the company's significant financial flexibility. Decisions that increase  leverage beyond 1.75x in the absence of a credible plan to reduce leverage will  likely lead to a negative rating action. LIQUIDITY Disney's liquidity position and financial flexibility remain strong and is  supported by significant FCF generation as well as $6 billion of aggregate  available borrowing capacity (as of June 27, 2015) under three credit  facilities. Commitments under these credit facilities support the company's $6  billion CP program and expire during March 2016 ($1.5 billion), June 2017 ($2.25  billion) and March 2019 ($2.25 billion). In addition, the company had  approximately $4.5 billion of cash on hand as of June 27, 2015. Scheduled  maturities are well laddered and manageable considering FCF generation  expectations and access to capital markets.  Disney does not have any debt scheduled to mature during the remainder of fiscal  2015.  Approximately $2 billion of debt is scheduled to mature during fiscal  2016 followed by $2.2 billion during fiscal 2017. Fitch does not expect debt  reduction going forward. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates Disney as follows: The Walt Disney Company --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper at 'F1'. ABC Inc. --IDR at 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A'. Disney Enterprises, Inc. --IDR at 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A'. Total debt as of June 27, 2015 was approximately $15.3 billion and consisted of: --$2.4 billion of commercial paper (CP); --$11.9 billion of notes and debentures, with maturities ranging from December  2015 to 2093; --$253 million of debt related to Hong Kong Disneyland (as of FYE14), which is  non-recourse back to Disney but which Fitch consolidates under the assumption  that the company would back the loan payments;  --Approximately $530 million of foreign currency-denominated debt (as of FYE14),  including the debt related to the acquisition of UTV. Fitch links the IDRs of the issuing entities (predominantly based on the lack of  any material restrictions on movements of cash between the entities) and treats  the unsecured debt of the entire company as pari passu. Fitch recognizes the  absence of upstream guarantees from the operating assets and that debt at Disney  Enterprises is structurally senior to the holding company debt.

Fitch would consider distinguishing between the ratings if we viewed  there to be heightened risk of the company's IDR falling to non-investment grade  (where Disney Enterprises' enhanced recovery prospects would be more relevant).

442,"  (Repeats for additional subscribers)By David RandallNEW YORK, Sept 14 This fall, Boston-based fund giant Fidelity plans to celebrate the 25-year tenure of William Danoff, head of the biggest fund run by a single manager in the U.S. and arguably the best-performing large cap manager of his time.At a time when investors have been shifting tens of billions of dollars from active management to passively-managed funds, Danoff is one of the few mutual fund managers whose quarterly disclosures can move market prices. His Contrafund, with $106.3 billion in assets under management, is a mainstay of retirement savings plans nationwide.Yet some financial advisors and fund analysts say they are concerned that Fidelity has yet to name a co-manager for Contrafund, setting up the risk that investors will flee and remaining shareholders will suffer should Danoff, 55, retire or otherwise leave the fund suddenly.""There is a key man risk with Contrafund,"" said Katie Rushkewicz Reichart, an analyst at Morningstar who covers the fund. ""Not only has Danoff done quite well but he's managing such a large sum of money that it's not a role that another person could easily step into.""Those concerns are an echo of last September, when Bill Gross, who often referred to himself as the king of bonds, abruptly left Pimco and his management of the Total Return fund. To be sure, Gross had his worst performance in nearly two decades in the year before he left Pimco, and the fund had seen 16 straight months of outflows leading up to his departure. After his departure, Total Return suffered $18 billion in outflows in the first month alone, and another $107 billion between October 2014 and August 2015, according to Lipper data.Should Danoff leave, a sizeable rush to redeem shares could force Contrafund to unload some of its positions in companies such as Facebook, Apple, and Walt Disney  in which it is one of the largest shareholders, analysts said. Retirement plans, meanwhile, may be forced to remove the fund from among its investment options because the fund would no longer have the same management team in place for at least three years.Most advisors and institutional investors require at least a three-year track record with current management before investing, and the slate is wiped clean if the principal manager leaves without having three years or more with a co-manager, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research at S&P Capital IQ. Fidelity did not make Danoff available for this article, but said concerns about succession planning are overblown.""Will is not going anywhere,"" said Brian Hogan, the head of Fidelity's equity division. ""I can say that with a lot of confidence. I talk to Will almost every day in person, on phone, or email. He's tremendously engaged and he's the investment leader, a real workhorse in the department.""When asked what would happen if Danoff was somehow incapacitated, Hogan said, ""We have a tremendously deep bench of portfolio managers who may not be household names yet but probably will be.""The problem is unique to Fidelity: the next-largest stock fund run by a single manager, the T Rowe Price Growth Stock fund, run by Joseph Fath, is at $44.1 billion under assets, while the third largest is another Fidelity product, the Fidelity Growth Company fund, at $39.2 billion, run by Steven Wymer. 'ABSENT-MINDED PROFESSOR' Since he took over Contrafund in September of 1990, Danoff has posted an average annualized gain of 13.3 percent, the best performance of any large cap growth fund over the same time, according to Lipper data. The benchmark S&P 500 posted a 10 percent annualized gain over the same time, while the average actively managed large cap fund returned an annualized 9.4 percent.Someone who invested $10,000 in Contrafund in September 1990 would now have $213,719, more than double the $103,058 gain from investing in the S&P 500. The average large cap fund, meanwhile, would have returned $95,586 from the same investment. That performance is one reason why Fidelity emphasizes the chance to work with him to potential recruits, and why he leads a meeting each year with all of the firm's analysts that is said to be standing room only. Known to carry around a spiral notebook with handwritten notes on stocks, Danoff meets with hundreds of companies a year, and has easy access to management at companies who are keen to receive his endorsement.Danoff, who joined Fidelity in 1986 as an analyst, has a degree in history from Harvard and an MBA from Wharton. He's known to walk around with a bulging file folder and messy hair, a marked contrast from some of the slickly-groomed fund managers who often show up on television.""I love Will Danoff, he's like the absent-minded professor and he has encyclopedia knowledge of stocks,"" said David Caruso, managing director of Danvers, Massachusetts Coastal Capital Group who oversees approximately $800 million in client assets. ""If he were to leave I would have to think very hard about leaving my assets there.""Fidelity named John Roth as co-manager of another fund that Danoff had run by himself, the $27 billion Fidelity Advisor New Insights fund, in 2013. The move was interpreted by many fund analysts as a sign that Roth will eventually become Danoff's successor at Contrafund.Ford Motor Company announced last month it would drop Contrafund from its fund lineup, pulling $900 million from the fund.

This is the eighth straight quarter of declining sales for the 56-year-old Barbie brand. Mattel, which in 2014 got nearly half of its revenue from international markets, said a strong dollar also hurt sales.""Forex will continue to be a headwind across many key markets,"" Chief Executive Christopher Sinclair said on a post-earnings call.Sinclair said the results were broadly in line with ""our expectations at this stage of our turnaround"". The company said third-quarter adjusted and reported earnings per share reflect the negative impact of 20 cents from the strong dollar.Sinclair also said the company was ""aggressively developing plans to offset the Disney Princess revenue gap"".Smaller rival Hasbro Inc in 2014 won the license to make Walt Disney Co's Disney Princess dolls, including those based on the movie ""Frozen"".Hasbro will start selling the toys in January. Mattel's net income fell to $223.8 million, or 66 cents per share, in the quarter, from $331.8 million, or 97 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, it earned 71 cents per share, below analysts' average estimate of 80 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net sales fell 11.3 percent to $1.79 billion, missing the average analyst estimate of $1.89 billion.The El Segundo, California-based company's shares regained some losses and were down 3 percent in extended trading.Up to Thursday's close of $22.53, Mattel's stock had fallen about 27 percent this year.(Reporting by Subrat Patnaik in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)",2015-10-15,DIS,"Thu Oct 15, 2015 | 6:43pm EDT","UPDATE 2-Mattel sales miss estimates as Barbie slips, dollar weighs",http://www.reuters.com//article/mattel-results-idUSL3N12F5WH20151015?type=companyNews

485,"  Dec 18 Walt Disney Co's shares slumped after BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield cuts his rating to ""sell"" from ""neutral"", saying the likely success of the latest Star Wars movie would not be enough to offset the impact of subscriber losses at ESPN.Disney' shares fell as much as 3.6 percent to $108.01 on Friday as BTIG became the only brokerage among 33 to rate the stock ""sell"".The company first warned of subscriber losses at ESPN in August and since then other media companies have spoken of concerns that viewers are increasingly opting for online streaming over pay TV.Disney's management made a mistake by overpaying for sports rights based on ""overly aggressive"" multichannel video subscriber projections, Greenfield wrote in a note to clients.""ESPN now appears poised to become Disney's most troubled business as consumer behavior shifts rapidly,"" he said. BTIG thinks ""Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens"" would help Disney ""modestly"" top earnings estimates in 2016, but said consensus estimates were ""too high"" for 2017 and ""far too high"" for 2018.""Our problem is not 2016 ... our problem is that we don't think they have significant growth from there forward,"" Greenfield said on CNBC. Greenfield said Disney's cable network's profitability would meaningfully underperform investor expectations, which would eat into operating income in 2017.Cable networks represents about 46 percent of Disney's total operating income. Greenfield said if the new Star Wars movie did not rake in more than $2 billion in worldwide box office revenue, Disney would miss Wall Street's profit estimates in 2016 as well.BTIG had a ""buy"" rating on the stock for five years until March, Greenfield said on CNBC.Disney's shares were down 2.3 percent at $109.39 in late morning trading. BTIG has a price target of $90 on the stock.

498,"   By Lisa Richwine | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" shattered box office records with an estimated $517 million in worldwide ticket sales through Sunday, a staggering debut that re-established the celebrated space saga as a global phenomenon under Walt Disney Co.The first ""Star Wars"" film in a decade recorded the biggest domestic opening in Hollywood's history, collecting $238 million over the weekend in the United States and Canada. It also set records in Britain, Australia, Russia and elsewhere as fans embraced a new chapter in the galactic battle between good and evil.Thousands joined a mock lightsaber battle in Los Angeles, where an Australian couple married in line for the film. President Obama ended a news conference on Friday saying he needed to head to a White House screening of the movie, and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton closed Saturday's Democratic debate saying, ""May the Force be with you.""""I don't think ever in the history of movies has their been more hype leading up to release of a film,"" said Jeff Bock, senior box office analyst at Exhibitor Relations Co. ""This is a huge, huge win.""The film's financial and critical success mark a victory for Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger's strategy of acquiring proven brands, including Pixar Animation and comic book powerhouse Marvel, to fuel Disney's entertainment empire.Disney purchased ""Star Wars"" producer Lucasfilm for $4 billion in 2012 as part of his bet on big-budget films.Movie theater attendance in the United States and Canada, the world's largest film market, has barely changed in a decade as online and mobile platforms exploded. Subscribers to Disney's sports powerhouse, ESPN, have shrunk, a much-noted sign of pressure on traditional media. The turnout for ""Star Wars"" is an encouraging result for Disney, rival media companies and movie theaters. ""We have so many options for entertainment, yet look at where everyone is flocking this weekend - to the multiplex,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at box office tracking firm Rentrak. ""Disney has this down to a science.""Global sales for ""Force Awakens"" finished second only to the dinosaur film ""Jurassic World,"" which in its June opening garnered $525 million worldwide, including China, where the ""Star Wars"" film will not open for weeks. ""Jurassic World"" took $208.8 million at domestic theaters in its first weekend.""Force Awakens"" is the seventh installment in the epic science-fiction franchise created by George Lucas in 1977.Filmgoers reveled in the return to the ""Star Wars"" galaxy, dressing as Jedi or Sith, carrying lightsabers and cheering when classic characters such as Princess Leia or Chewbacca appeared on screen. Theaters added showtimes to meet demand.   Disney plans four ""Star Wars"" movies through 2019, plus major expansions at its U.S. theme parks to incorporate the droids, spaceships and otherworldly creatures of the universe Lucas invented. ""Force Awakens"" toys, clothing, home accessories and video games already pervade stores ahead of Christmas.A Reuters Breakingviews analysis last week calculated that Disney may be on track to triple its Lucasfilm investment and earn an average of $669 million off the franchise in each of the next six years. Nostalgia, plus a carefully planned, months-long release of film trailers and character profiles boosted interest. Disney, which spent more than $200 million to make ""Force Awakens,"" also created intrigue by keeping the plot largely secret.   Critics lauded the movie's throwback feel, doses of humor and the performances of newcomers Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Oscar Isaac. Audiences awarded an ""A"" grade in polling by survey firm CinemaScore.Disney took steps to attract more women and girls to the series, including casting Ridley as the star and running commercials during shows such as ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians."" Forty-two percent of the weekend's domestic audience was female, Disney said.""Force Awakens"" could become the highest-grossing movie of all time, box office analysts said. ""Avatar"" holds that title with $2.8 billion in global sales.The wild card is China, the world's second-largest movie market, where ""Force Awakens"" opens Jan. 9. The last ""Star Wars"" movie in 2005 collected just $9 million there.Disney made an effort to build buzz, placing 500 miniature Stormtroopers at the Great Wall and striking a deal to stream the six earlier ""Star Wars"" films through video service Tencent.

The market had traded higher for much of the session after Yellen told Congress she does not expect the central bank to reverse the rate hike program it began in December.

538,"   By Subrat Patnaik  Having captivated boys with its Star Wars figures, Hasbro Inc is turning to Disney Princesses and the launch of its first animated movie to arrest a five-quarter slump in sales of its toys for girls.The second-biggest U.S. toymaker has begun selling dolls from the popular Disney movies ""Frozen"" and ""Cinderella"" after wresting the lucrative license from its larger rival, Mattel Inc.Hasbro will also launch ""My Little Pony"" toys throughout this year, Chief Executive Brian Goldner told Reuters, as it aims to create a buzz ahead of the 2017 release of a movie voiced by Emily Blunt and Emmy award-winning Kristin Chenoweth.It's a strategy that worked well for Hasbro in the run-up to the December 2015 release of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens.""""Getting it on the shelves early allows Hasbro to maximize the window in which it can sell,"" said Neil Saunders, chief executive of research firm Conlumino.Of Hasbro's four distinct product categories, toys for girls have long been a weak spot. In a fourth quarter that delivered the company's biggest revenue growth in nearly five years, sales of toys for girls fell 17 percent.Toys for boys accounted for 40 percent of Hasbro's revenue last year. The contribution from toys for girls - its third-largest category, behind games - fell to just 18 percent in 2015 from 24 percent a year earlier. A merger with Mattel, bringing Barbie into its world, might be one way to solve Hasbro's girl problems. Bloomberg reported this month that the two companies had held inconclusive talks about a potential merger.Goldner, in an interview with Reuters, declined to comment on the report. Instead, he focused on Hasbro's plans to twin merchandise with movies.Goldner, CEO since 2008, is no stranger to the screen, having brokered deals with several major studios for movies based on Hasbro's best-known brands. He worked as an executive producer on the blockbuster ""Transformers"" series.""My Little Pony: The Movie"" is the debut animation production of Hasbro's in-house film unit, Allspark Pictures, and will follow the adventures of Twilight Sparkle, Pinkie Pie and the other brightly colored ponies of Equestria. Among the new toys slated for release are a purple dragon, Spike, and a winged foal, Baby Flurry Heart.Speaking to Reuters, Jim Silver, editor-in-chief of toys and sporting goods review website TTPM, described the new dolls as having ""a really modern, slick, cool look.""While analysts expect the ponies to sell well, a more immediate impact should be felt from the Walt Disney Co license, which includes dolls based on the hit movie ""Frozen.""Leaving Barbie behind in fourth place, dolls based on ""Frozen"" princesses Elsa and Anna were second only to Star Wars on the ""Top Ranked Properties of 2015"" list compiled by NPD Group, a retail research firm. ""These products are already on shelves in the U.S. and rolling out internationally,"" said Goldner. ""Shipments are now ramping up and early consumer indications are positive.""Stephanie Wissink, analyst with Piper Jaffray & Co, said she expected the license to earn Hasbro about $250 million this year and a further $375 million in 2017.With most analysts expecting sales of Star Wars toys to be flat this year, toys for girls should contribute a larger share of Hasbro's revenue. A forecast from KeyBanc Capital Markets, for example, has the proportion rebounding above 20 percent in 2016.The average forecast of 12 analysts covering Hasbro is for 2016 revenue of $4.7 billion, which would represent a 5.6 percent increase - the biggest, year-on-year, since 2011. Hasbro has not provided its own forecast.Over the past two years, Hasbro's shares have risen by more than a third while Mattel's have fallen about 10 percent.

544,"   By Brent Lang  LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Disney’s “Zootopia” scored the fourth biggest March opening ever, debuting to $73.7 million over the weekend.The animated story about a rabbit who joins the police force ranks as the biggest Disney Animation launch (though not the best Pixar debut), outstripping “Frozen,” the 2012 blockbuster that bowed to $67.4 million. With no major family film opening until “The Jungle Book” lands on April 15, “Zootopia” is well positioned to be the de facto choice for moviegoers with children for the next month.“There’s an absence of competition,” said Dave Hollis, Disney’s distribution chief. “We are set up to have a big, big run.”Disney did not release a budget, but most animated films cost in excess of $100 million. “Zootopia” screened in 3,827 locations.Overseas, where “Zootopia” has been playing for three weeks, the film added another $63.4 million to its haul, pushing its global total to $232.5 million. The film continues a sterling comeback run for Disney Animation, which had reached a creative and commercial nadir in the early aughts with the likes of “Home on the Range” and “Treasure Planet.” Since Pixar’s Ed Catmull and John Lasseter took the reins following Disney’s 2006 acquisition of their company, the animation arm has roared back to life, fielding hits such as “Frozen,” “Tangled,” and “Wreck It Ralph,” and winning Oscars.“They brought a focus on quality,” said Hollis. “They recognize that quality is the best business plan.” Beyond the bunnies, Gerard Butler managed to wash out some of the sour taste in his mouth after “Gods of Egypt” flopped spectacularly. “London Has Fallen,” the Scottish actor’s followup to “Olympus Has Fallen,” opened solidly to $21.5 million from 3,490 locations for a second place finish. That does, however, trail the first film’s $30 million debut.Focus Features fielded the picture, which carried a $60 million price tag. It played older, with more than 76% of the audience clocking in over the age of 25, while men made up 60% of ticket buyers.“We’re really pleased with the opening and we think we’re going to leg out well from here,” said Jim Orr, Focus’ distribution chief. “That older demographic doesn’t necessarily rush out on opening weekend.” Tina Fey was not as lucky as Butler. The actress’ “Whiskey Tango Foxtrot” stumbled with a $7.6 million launch from 2,374 venues. Paramount backed the $35 million dramedy about a war reporter who gets hooked on the adrenaline rush of covering Afghanistan. War films and political comedies can be tough sells — witness the financial failures of “Charlie Wilson’s War,” “Our Brand is Crisis,” and “Jarhead” — and “Whiskey Tango Foxtrot” appears to be no exception. The studio isn’t ready to wave a white flag yet. Paramount Vice Chairman Rob Moore said that he hoped the audience would build in the coming weeks, as it did for Fey’s recent hit “Sisters.”“We were hoping for more,” he said. “But Tina’s last movie played to a good multiple and we had a good Saturday, so we have a chance of playing for a little while to a reasonable outcome.”After four weeks in theaters, “Deadpool” barreled past the $300 million mark. The comic book movie finished in third place with $16.4 million, pushing its domestic haul to $311.1 million. “Gods of Egypt” rounded out the top five, picking up $5 million. The $140 million action epic has earned a meagre $22.8 million domestically after two weeks — a terrible result for a picture that was intended to usher in a new franchise.Fresh off its best picture win at last weekend’s Academy Awards, newspaper drama “Spotlight” capitalized on the Oscar love by pulling in $1.8 million. The film has netted $41.6 million during its theatrical run.In limited release, Broad Green debuted “Knight of Cubs,” Terrence Malick’s lyrical portrait of the spiritual journey of a writer (Christian Bale), in four theaters where it earned $56,688 for a $14,172 per-screen average.March was once seen as a dumping ground for movies, but the success of spring releases like “The Hunger Games,” “Alice in Wonderland,” “Cinderella,” and now “Zootopia” has shattered that prejudice, analysts say.“This proves March is now a blockbuster month,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at ComScore. “You can open a blockbuster any time of the year.”",2016-03-06,DIS,"Mon Mar 7, 2016 | 7:32pm EST",Disney's 'Zootopia' opens big with $73.7 million debut,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-boxoffice-idUSKCN0W80WQ?type=companyNews

548,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 30 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'A' Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) assigned to The Walt Disney Company (Disney) and its subsidiaries.  The Rating Outlook remains Stable. A full list of ratings follows at the end of  this release. Approximately $18.9 billion of debt outstanding as of Jan. 2, 2016  is affected by Fitch's action. KEY RATING DRIVERS Significant Financial Flexibility: Disney's operating profile positions the  company to generate free cash flow (FCF) in excess of $3.5 billion annually  during the ratings horizon, which coupled with strong liquidity and solid credit  metrics provides the company with considerable financial flexibility at the  current ratings. Disney's investment cycle within its Parks and Resorts segment  is expected to increase capital spending to approximately $5 billion during  fiscal 2016, which will temporarily hamper FCF generation. Consistent Financial Policy: Given the strength of Disney's underlying  businesses, strong liquidity position and Fitch's FCF expectations, Disney has  the financial flexibility to accommodate a higher level of share repurchases,  which are expected to range between $6 billion and $8 billion during fiscal  2016, in a manner consistent with its current ratings. Ratings incorporate  Fitch's expectations that the company's share repurchases and M&A activity will  likely exceed FCF generation given strong liquidity and the current credit  profile. Leading Market Positions and Leveragability: Disney has a very consistent  investment strategy centered on creating or acquiring intellectual property and  content that is leverageable across Disney's various platforms. Disney is  uniquely positioned, relative to its peers, to capitalize and monetize its  internally or externally developed franchises and brands, which in turn  strengthens the company's operating and credit profile and provides Disney with  a sustainable competitive advantage. Strength of Cable Networks: Disney's strong portfolio of cable networks, ESPN in  particular, underlies the company's ratings. Fitch Ratings believes that the  top-tier channels will continue to be a must carry for the distributors and are  likely to retain pricing power. Disney's operating profile benefits from the  stability, recurring dual-stream revenue profile, high operating margin and FCF  generation characteristics attributable to its cable network business. Fitch  expects this segment will continue to generate a significant amount of Disney's  cash flow. Credible Strategy to Address Threats: Disney's strong asset portfolio positions  the company to address the secular threats and opportunities presented by  emerging alternative distribution platforms and continued audience fragmentation  across the media and entertainment landscape. Overall the ratings reflect the company's leading market positions within its  core businesses. Further, Disney has a very consistent investment strategy that  is centered on creating or acquiring intellectual property and content that is  leverageable across its various platforms (cable and broadcast network, studio,  parks and resorts, and consumer products).  Disney's operating profile positions the company to generate meaningful levels  of FCF (defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and  dividends), providing the company with considerable financial flexibility at the  current ratings. Disney's investment cycle within its Parks and Resort segment  is expected to increase capital spending to approximately $5 billion during  fiscal 2016, which will temporarily hamper FCF generation during fiscal 2016.  Fitch anticipates that Disney will generate in excess of $3.5 billion of annual  FCF during the ratings horizon. Disney's strong portfolio of cable networks underlies the company's ratings, and  its operating profile continues to benefit from the stable, recurring  dual-stream revenue profile and high operating margin characteristics  attributable to its cable network business. Fitch believes there is sufficient  flexibility within the current ratings to accommodate slower affiliate fee  revenue and operating income growth within this business.  Disney's cable networks generate the largest portion of total revenue and  EBITDA, resulting in incremental stability in the total revenue and FCF profile.  Secular issues such as the stagnant multi-channel video subscriber base and its  effect on affiliate fee revenue, rising programming costs, particularly sports  programming, the impact of foreign exchange, and Disney's ability to pass the  higher costs on to multi-channel video programming distributors (MVPDs) will  remain a significant risk to the company's operating profile. However, Fitch  believes that Disney is in a strong position to retain pricing power going  forward, as its collection of top-tier cable networks continue to command  audience and ratings and be a must-carry for the MVPDs. In addition, Disney has,  in large part, successfully matched the tenor of its long-term sports  programming rights with the terms of its various affiliation agreements with the  MVPDs.  Ratings incorporate the cyclicality of the company's businesses, particularly  Parks & Resorts (30% of Disney's revenue through the LTM Jan. 2, 2016), Consumer  Products & Interactive Media, and the advertising portion of broadcast and cable  networks (16%). Should macroeconomic volatility return, Fitch expects these  cyclical businesses to be under renewed pressure but that the company's credit  and financial profile will likely remain within expectations for the current  ratings.  Disney is well positioned to address the secular threats and opportunities  presented by emerging alternative distribution platforms and continued audience  fragmentation across the media and entertainment landscape. The evolving media  landscape, including the growing prominence of Internet-based and time shifted  television content, will not have a material negative impact on Disney's credit  profile or FCF over the intermediate term. Further, in Fitch's view, the  proliferation of new over-the-top entrants and methods of consumption will  continue to drive more demand for Disney's content. As to the uncertainty around  the continued ability of cable networks to pass increased programming costs on  to the distributors, Fitch believes it poses moderate risk to cable network  providers over the longer term. Mitigants for Disney include Fitch's belief that  the top-tier channels will retain leverage with distributors going forward. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case include: --The revenue growth within the company's cable networks business (Disney's  Media Networks segment) reflects the stability of the business and expected  affiliate fee increases. Fitch anticipates mid-single-digit affiliate revenue  growth.  --Disney's broadcasting business benefits from a stable economic and advertising  environment while incorporating typical political advertising revenue cycle.  Additionally this segment will benefit from growing retransmission consent fees.  Revenue growth ranges between 2% during non-political years and 4% during  political years. --Programming expenses are expected to increase by high-single digits driven by  sports rights costs.  --Fitch assumes typical volatility within the Studio Entertainment, Parks and  Resort, and Consumer Products & Interactive Media operating segments.  --Domestic revenues grow faster than International revenues within the company's  Parks and Resort segment. Fitch incorporates start-up expenses related to the  opening of its Shanghai Disney Resort in 2016.  --Fitch expects low double digit growth within Disney's Studio Entertainment  segment this year due to the release of Star Wars and a strong 2016 film slate.  Theatrical revenues are slightly offset by a weaker Home Video release schedule  when compared to 2015. Home entertainment revenues will track the theatrical  success in 2017 and 2018. Television and SVOD revenues grow at a mid-single  digit pace while home entertainment revenues remain flat. --From a margin perspective, the base case assumes relatively flat margins  within the company's Media Networks segment as retransmission revenue gains  enhance broadcast margins while cable network margins remain stable reflecting  the company's ability to grow higher margin affiliate fee revenues at a similar  pace to increasing programming costs. Disney's pre-opening expenses related to  its Shanghai Disneyland opening are expected to be offset by strong domestic  operating performance leading to relatively flat margins within the company's  Parks and Resorts segment. Coming off a strong operating performance in fiscal  2015, margins within Studio Entertainment are expected to contract somewhat  during fiscal 2016. LEVERAGE AND FINANCIAL POLICY Fitch does not anticipate any meaningful changes to Disney's financial policy  over the ratings horizon. Fitch believes Disney maintains an appropriate balance  between returning capital to shareholders, in the form of dividends and share  repurchases, and investing in the strategic needs of its business. In terms of  capital allocation priority, Fitch believes investing in internal opportunities  focused on organic growth, such as the company's investment in its various parks  and resorts worldwide and long term sports rights deals, takes precedence over  merger and acquisitions and shareholder returns. Disney's capital structure and credit protection metrics remain consistent and  within Fitch's expectations for the current rating. Consolidated leverage of  1.1x as of the latest 12 months (LTM) period ended Jan. 2, 2016, is in line with  fiscal year-end 2015 and 2014 metrics. Going forward, Fitch believes leverage  will range between 1x and 1.4x during the ratings horizon after consideration  for a modest increase in debt levels related to the higher level of share  repurchases. SHAREHOLDER RETURNS Fitch expects that Disney will manage the level of share repurchase activity in  a manner consistent with its current ratings and acknowledges that the company's  share repurchases and M&A activity will likely exceed FCF generation. Fitch  anticipates share repurchases to range between $6 billion and $8 billion during  fiscal 2016. Disney repurchased approximately 21.2 million shares of its common  stock for approximately $2.4 billion during its first quarter of fiscal 2016. As  of Jan. 2, 2016, the company had remaining authorization to repurchase  approximately 334 million additional shares.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Upward momentum to the ratings is unlikely over the intermediate term.  However, a compelling rationale for, and an explicit public commitment to, more  conservative leverage thresholds could result in upgrade consideration.  Negative: Negative rating actions are more likely to coincide with discretionary  actions of Disney's management rather than by operating performance, reflecting  the company's significant financial flexibility. Decisions that increase  leverage beyond 1.75x in the absence of a credible plan to reduce leverage will  likely lead to a negative rating action. LIQUIDITY Disney's liquidity position and financial flexibility remain strong and is  supported by significant FCF generation as well as $6 billion of aggregate  available borrowing capacity (as of Jan. 2, 2016) under three credit facilities.  Commitments under these credit facilities support the company's $6 billion CP  program and expire during March 2017 ($1.5 billion), March 2019 ($2.25 billion)  and March 2021 ($2.25 billion). In addition, the company had approximately $4.3  billion of cash on hand as of Jan. 2, 2016. Scheduled maturities are well  laddered and manageable considering FCF generation expectations and access to  capital markets.  Disney has approximately $2 billion of debt that isscheduled to mature during  fiscal 2016 ($500 matured during Dec. 2015) followed by $2.2 billion and $1.8  billion during fiscal 2017 and 2018 respectively. Fitch does not expect debt  reduction going forward. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Total debt as of Jan. 2, 2016 was approximately $18.9 billion and consisted of: --$4.3 billion of commercial paper (CP); --$13.4 billion of notes and debentures, with maturities ranging from February  2016 - 2093; --$532 million of debt related to international theme parks, which is  non-recourse back to Disney but which Fitch consolidates under the assumption  that the company would back the loan payments;  --Approximately $667 million of foreign currency-denominated debt (as of FYE15),  including the debt related to the acquisition of UTV. Fitch affirms Disney's ratings as follows: The Walt Disney Company --IDR at 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A'; --Senior unsecured revolvers at 'A'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper at 'F1'. ABC Inc. --IDR at 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A'. Disney Enterprises, Inc. --IDR at 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A'. Fitch links the IDRs of the issuing entities (predominantly based on the lack of  any material restrictions on movements of cash between the entities) and treats  the unsecured debt of the entire company as pari passu. Fitch recognizes the  absence of upstream guarantees from the operating assets and that debt at Disney  Enterprises is structurally senior to the holding company debt. However, Fitch  does not distinguish the issue ratings at the two entities due to the strong 'A'  category-investment grade IDR, Fitch's expectations of stable financial policies  and the anticipation that future debt will be issued by Walt Disney Company.  Fitch would consider distinguishing between the ratings if it perceived  heightened risk of the company's IDR falling to non-investment grade (where  Disney Enterprises' enhanced recovery prospects would be more relevant).

549,"   By Tova Cohen | TEL AVIV  TEL AVIV Playbuzz, a U.S.-Israeli platform for distributing online content, has raised $15 million in funding led by Saban Ventures, with participation from Walt Disney Co (DIS.N).Existing investors 83North, Carmel Ventures and FirstTime Ventures also participated in the funding, which follows a $16 million investment round last year.Playbuzz said on Thursday it will use the money to develop its platform and expand its sponsored-content business, which works with companies such as Pizza Hut, Unilever and Ford to create advertising campaigns. Playbuzz is used by thousands of publishers such as Time, USA Today, the Daily Telegraph and HBO to create content in new formats to boost audience engagement.""People are becoming impatient and don't read a lot today. Traditional media is usually long-form articles or video and they don't make sense in an era where people discover content on a four-inch screen,"" Shaul Olmert, Playbuzz's New York-based CEO, told Reuters. While quizzes are the most shared format on social media, Playbuzz also provides publishers with slideshows, flip cards, galleries and lists. U.S. media outlet The Hill used its video snaps format to divide a video previewing a Republican party debate into segments, enabling viewers to skip to candidates they wanted to hear.UK newspaper publisher The Independent used a new format called swiper asking readers to agree or disagree with Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn's policies.Olmert said the average time spent looking at a traditional news article is less than 15 seconds compared with 3-4 minutes for Playbuzz-powered content. With 100 employees including 60 in Israel, Playbuzz makes money from sponsored content and began seeing revenue in the last quarter of 2015. For example, American Express placed a quiz on UK media sites asked readers which family vacation they preferred and recommended places to travel.U.S. digital ad spending in 2016 will reach $68.8 billion, or 35.8 percent of total media ad spending, rising to $105.2 billion in 2020, according to eMarketer.  Olmert, the son of former Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert, expects revenue this year to more than triple.Playbuzz competes with sites such as Buzzfeed, the Huffington Post and Vox Media for advertising, especially in sponsored campaigns. But Olmert notes they are publishers while Playbuzz distributes content for its partners on thousands of sites.The investment by Disney and media tycoon Haim Saban, who chairs Univision, is part of a partnership that will lead to new projects, Olmert said.

561,"   By Caroline Valetkevitch | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Oil prices edged lower on Monday after producers failed to agree on a plan to curb global supply at a meeting in Qatar, while world stock markets rose and the Dow Jones industrial average closed above 18,000 for the first time since July.Shares of consumer companies including Hasbro (HAS.O) and Walt Disney (DIS.N) helped buoy U.S. stocks, while investors braced for a flurry of quarterly earnings reports through the week. In Qatar, some 18 oil-exporting nations, including OPEC members, failed to agree to stabilize output at January levels until October 2016. A pact fell apart after Saudi Arabia demanded that Iran join in.Crude oil ended well off the day's lows, however, with a strike in Kuwait slashing the country's oil output by more than half. Brent crude LCOc1 settled down 19 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $42.91 a barrel, after falling $3 earlier in the session, while U.S. WTI crude CLc1 closed down 58 cents, or 1.4 percent, at $39.78 a barrel, after hitting $37.61 earlier.Some analysts said they don't expect oil to fall significantly more as a result of the Qatar news.""While a few forecasters may be dusting off some old $20 WTI expectations as a result of the Doha outcome, we expect solid support in nearby WTI at the $35 mark,"" Jim Ritterbusch at Chicago oil consultancy Ritterbusch & Associates said. A recent rebound in oil and signs that the U.S. economy is slowly improving have helped stocks rally from a steep selloff earlier this year that had pushed the S&P 500 down as much as 10.5 percent.  On Wall Street, Walt Disney rose 2.9 percent a share after its ""Jungle Book"" film dominated the weekend box office, while Hasbro jumped 5.8 percent after reporting better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue. An index of energy shares .SPNY rose 1.6 percent as crude prices pared losses.  The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 106.7 points, or 0.6 percent, to close at 18,004.16, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 13.61 points, or 0.65 percent, to 2,094.34 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 21.80 points, or 0.44 percent, to 4,960.02.

The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was down 0.22 percent at 94.486 .DXY.U.S. Treasury yields rose as oil prices ended off their lows and as investors focused on next week's Federal Reserve meeting.""Oil prices are going to continue to be very important to the market,"" said Mary Ann Hurley, vice president in fixed income trading at D.A.

565,"   By Jessica Toonkel  Turner Communications is expected to announce Tuesday that it is launching its own streaming video-on-demand service for film buffs this fall, according to a company statement reviewed by ReutersTurner, which is a division of Time Warner Inc, is the latest in a wave of media companies to launch its own over-the-top video service to accommodate the growing number of younger viewers who are cancelling cable subscriptions in favor or watching content online, a practice known as  cord-cutting.The new service, called FilmStruck,  will focus on independent, foreign, art house and cult classic films that people know and not original shows as streaming video providers, like Amazon, Hulu and Netflix, are increasingly doing. Turner is partnering with New York-based film distributor, Criterion Collection, which until now had offered all of its 1,100 films through Hulu.FilmStruck will not only feature films like ""Mad Max,"" ""Cinema Paradiso"" and ""Seven Samurai,"" but also will have filmmakers' commentaries, bonus content and stories about the films themselves,  Coleman Breland, president of Turner Classic Movies and Turner content distribution, said in an interview.  ""We didn't just jump into the fray and say let's offer an SVOD [streaming video on demand] service,"" Breland said. ""This is very targeted and focused."" FilmStruck will be managed by Turner Classic Movies. The company hopes to announce pricing for the service within the next 60 days, said Breland. The service will be solely subscription-based and will not have any advertisements.Turner is launching its own streaming online service just months after reports surfaced that its parent Time Warner was in discussions to take a stake in Hulu, which is jointly owned by 21st Century Fox Inc , Walt Disney Co and Comcast Corp's NBCUniversal. The launch of FilmStruck is one example of what customers and investors should expect to see more of from Turner in the next several months as the company focuses on being more consumer-centric, said John Martin, chairman and CEO of Turner.

The animation studio's relationships also could make it easier for Comcast to distribute content in China.DreamWorks has aggressively courted audiences in that country, which is the world's second-largest film market and home to a growing population of city dwellers ready to spend on entertainment.This year's hit ""Kung Fu Panda 3,"" for example, was the first movie animated in both English and Mandarin. When it opened in February, it set a record for the biggest animated film opening in China. ""DreamWorks has done a very good job in building a team in China and learning the market,"" said Larry Namer, president and CEO of Metan Global Entertainment Group, which produces entertainment content for Chinese audiences. ""As far as the Hollywood entities go, I think they seem to understand the nuances of the market better than most.""Comcast's plan to purchase DreamWorks was announced on Thursday and requires approval from regulators.From January through March, 37 percent of Comcast's total revenue came from its content and theme park unit, NBCUniversal. Tapping into Asian markets could help that grow further, analysts said.But banking on Asia right now is no guarantee. China, the region's growth juggernaut for the last decade, has seen its economic expansion slow dramatically over the last two years, and its first-quarter gross domestic product increase of 6.7 percent on an annualized basis was its smallest since 2009. Larger rival Walt Disney Co, however, is busy ramping up its presence in China. The company will open a $5.5 billion Disney theme park in Shanghai in June. And its animated film ""Zootopia,"" released in March, has grossed more at Chinese box offices over its theatrical run than ""Kung Fu Panda 3.""NBCUniversal is building its own $3.3 billion theme park in Beijing. DreamWorks is a partner in an entertainment district planned for Shanghai. Universal Pictures opened an office in Beijing in 2014 and has consumer products staff in China.""I want to make sure that we're doing everything we can to grow that market as aggressively as possible,"" NBCU Chief Executive Steve Burke said Wednesday on the company's quarterly earnings call, a day before the DreamWorks deal was announced. With DreamWorks in the fold, Universal's parks could add movie characters like Shrek and Kung Fu Panda alongside Harry Potter and the yellow minions from ""Despicable Me.""""They are borrowing a page from the Disney playbook,"" MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett said. ""They will use these brands to drive traffic at their theme parks.""DreamWorks' ties in China also may ease the way for more NBCUniversal content into the country, analysts said. Chinese regulations limit the number of films imported into the country each year, and the government's censors often object to foreign entertainment content.NBCUniversal's strategy includes building its presence in other Asian countries and around the world. In September, it acquired a stake in Universal Studios Japan, which helped drive theme park sales in the first quarter of 2016.DreamWorks also provides original TV content to streaming service Netflix, which is now available in more than 130 countries, but not yet China. The DreamWorks TV business is expected to generate $1 billion in revenue from 2016 to 2018, Macquarie Securities analyst Amy Yong said.(Reporting by Lisa Richwine; Editing by Anna Driver and Lisa Girion)",2016-04-29,DIS,"Fri Apr 29, 2016 | 6:00am EDT",Comcast buy of 'Kung Fu Panda' producer aids Asia strategy,http://www.reuters.com//article/dreamworks-anim-ma-comcast-china-idUSL2N17V20M?type=companyNews
567,"   By Joseph Ax | NEW YORK  NEW YORK More than 30 New York City businesses, including Whole Foods Market Inc, Walt Disney Co's ABC and Anheuser Busch, have agreed to cut the trash they send to landfills by half by June, the mayor's office said on Monday.The ""Zero Waste Challenge"" is part of Mayor Bill de Blasio's ambitious goal to reduce the city's waste output by 90 percent by 2030, through increased recycling, reduced packaging and composting. In 2015, the city's sanitation department collected 3.2 million tons of waste.""We're doing what we can to make recycling and composting as accessible as possible to New Yorkers, but everyone will need to do their part to make a more sustainable New York City a reality,"" de Blasio said in a statement. ""These businesses are leading the way."" New York, with more than 8 million residents, is the largest city in the Western Hemisphere to adopt such a far-reaching plan. Los Angeles has announced a similar plan to reduce its waste by 90 percent by 2025.Participants in the challenge, which began in February, have already slashed 60 percent of their waste, on average, using strategies such as stocking coffee mugs rather than paper cups and switching from filing cabinets to digital storage, de Blasio said. Nearly 13,000 tons of trash have been diverted from landfills so far, they said. The challenge also requires businesses that regularly have leftover edible food to donate it to collection organizations like City Harvest, which distributes food to homeless shelters. Businesses in the challenge include Citi Field and Barclays Center, the homes of the New York Mets baseball team and the Brooklyn Nets basketball team, respectively; luxury hotels like The Peninsula and The Waldorf Astoria; high-end restaurants like Le Bernardin; and the e-commerce website Etsy Inc.

568,"   By Dave McNary  LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Marvel-Disney's ""Captain America: Civil War"" has opened the summer spectacularly with a dominant $181.8 million weekend at 4,266 U.S. locations.The third ""Captain America"" movie met lofty expectations with the fifth-best domestic opening weekend of all time -- trailing only ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" at $248 million, ""Jurassic World"" at $208.8 million, ""Marvel's The Avengers"" at $207.4 million and ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" at $191.3 million.The tentpole has already topped the final domestic total of 2011's ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" at $176.6 million and should eclipse 2014's ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" at $259 million by the end of next weekend.The marketing for ""Civil War"" clearly resonated with moviegoers, as it promised an epic fight between Chris Evans' Captain America and Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man, plus the introduction of Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther and Tom Holland's Spider-Man. Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst with ComScore, said the performance of ""Captain America: Civil War"" underlines Marvel and Disney's adept management of a key franchise.""'Captain America: Civil War' certainly delivered the goods as the official kick off movie of the summer of 2016 was in perfect position to capitalize on its sheer quality, massive entertainment value, brand appeal and a high-profile release date,"" he noted. ""Despite a cadre of sports-related options on the small screen, including the Kentucky Derby and Stanley Cup playoffs, 'Cap' came on strong with a top 5 all-time opening weekend debut and expected long-term bankability at the multiplex."" ""Captain America"" is also keeping the U.S. box office on track for a record performance in 2016 with $3.856 billion through this weekend -- 7.8% ahead of the same point last year and an impressive 14.7% ahead of 2014. Disney has played a major role in that gain with ""The Jungle Book"" and ""Zootopia"" delivering blockbuster numbers plus ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" providing $285 million, or 30% of its $936 million total.The fourth weekend of ""The Jungle Book"" finished second to ""Captain America"" with $21.9 million at 4,144 sites to lift its 24-day total to $285 million. Open Road's comedy ""Mother's Day"" came in a distant third with $9 million at 3,141, followed by Universal's third frame of ""The Huntsman: Winter's War"" with $3.6 million at 2,901. With its apt title, ""Mother's Day"" saw an impressive 7% rise in business during the Mother's Day weekend following a so-so opening frame. The ensemble movie, starring Jennifer Aniston, Julia Roberts and Kate Hudson, has taken in $20.7 million in its first ten days.The 10th weekend of ""Zootopia"" was edged out for fifth by New Line's second session of ""Keanu,"" which fell more than 67% to about $3.1 million. ""Zootopia"" followed with $2.7 million at 2,077 locations, bringing its 66-day total to $327.6 million.As a result, ""Zootopia"" has eclipsed Warner Bros.'

Investors in Walt Disney Co showed a lack of both in the company's stock on Wednesday.Disney's shares fell 4.5 percent to $101.76 in morning trading and were the biggest drag on the Dow Jones industrial average after the entertainment conglomerate's quarterly earnings and revenue fell short of sky-high estimates.As expected, Disney did get a boost from the success of the animated hit film ""Zootopia"" and ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"".But its cable business continued to struggle, theme park attendance was weaker than expected and product sales fell, leading to first miss on earnings per share in 19 quarters.""We believe the nature of Disney's franchises like Star Wars has resulted in expectations running ahead of reality,"" Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar wrote in a note to clients.  Venkateshwar rates Disney ""underweight"" on valuation, with a price target of $89.Disney has a forward price-earnings ratio of 17.3, compared with an average 14.4 for its peers.Thomson Reuters StarMine's intrinsic valuation model, which takes into account analysts' EPS forecasts, indicates Disney's stock should be trading at $98.12 - about $4 below where it was trading on Wednesday.""We are reluctant to pay a significant premium to the group average (and market) for Disney given that historical and projected growth rates have not generally been superior to peers,"" wrote Cowen & Co analyst Doug Creutz, who maintained a target of $88 on Disney's shares. RBC Capital analyst Steven Cahall, who has a price target of $103 on Disney, was also cautious.""...We're concerned that it's at peak earnings with ""The Force Awakens"" potentially setting an impossible comparable, and domestic parks running low on headroom with record occupancy, especially if U.S. economic weakness sets in,"" he wrote.For Goldman Sachs, troubles in Disney's cable business, which includes sports network ESPN, ""underscores our bear concern about rising expectations.""

589,"   By Adam Jourdan | SHANGHAI  SHANGHAI As the opening of the $5.5 billion Shanghai Disneyland draws near, Walt Disney Co has a challenge. The hold of rival Asian characters such as China’s homegrown Boonie Bears or Big Big Wolf means seven-year-olds like Li Yixuan have less time for Mickey Mouse and Friends.As Li settles on the living room floor for 15 minutes of cartoons before homework and bed, Disney doesn't get a look-in this time, as his favorite animated hero, Ultraman Ace from the hit Japanese series, does battle with space dinosaurs.And as the number of competing theme parks in China soars, it will become even harder to win the hearts of Chinese children — and open the wallets of their parents — to fuel long-term traffic after the turnstiles start clicking on June 16.""When we get kids now to write down their favorite cartoon character, very few put down Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck,"" said Song Lei, Hong Kong-based director at Animation-Comic-Game Group, the organizer of Asia’s biggest annual fair for comics, anime and games.    ""Instead it's what is being broadcast on television, what they're seeing in their day-to-day,"" he said. That means the Boonie Bears duo and mischievous, super-powered pig GG Bond, he said.That’s not helped by a ban on imported cartoons during the late afternoon “golden hour” peak viewing time for children.China's attitude to Disney is ambivalent, reflecting a clash between nationalistic sentiment and the desire for American-style consumption among the growing middle class.China's military-linked PLA Daily warned of what it said was ""invisible propaganda"" in Disney's ""Zootopia"". Yet Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger got a presidential welcome from Xi Jinping in May, and Disney has been granted ""special"" trademark protection. And Disney is still enjoying a banner year at the box office in China. ""Zootopia"", ""Captain America: Civil War"", ""The Jungle Book"" and ""Star Wars: the Force Awakens"" are among the 10 most-watched movies of 2016, reaping more than $690 million in ticket sales, according to Box Office Mojo. Characters from those films will feature at the Shanghai resort. ""There are people that love Disney and those that don't, for a variety of reasons,"" said Chris Yoshii, Asia-Pacific vice president for AECOM and a member of the Themed Entertainment Association. He predicts China's theme park market will overtake the United States in the ""not too distant future"".But that's by no means all Disney.About 2,500 parks are planned in China, including Japanese brand Hello Kitty, and there is already a ""Dwarf Empire"" in Yunnan.LOCAL TASTES  DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc.’s $2.4 billion DreamCenter and Six Flags Entertainment Corp.’s park slated to open in 2019 are among Disney’s U.S. competitors.Domestic rivals include Haichang Ocean Park Holdings, which plans to open the nation’s biggest marine park next year, and billionaire developer Wang Jianlin’s Dalian Wanda Group, which aims to unveil 15 in China by 2020 and five overseas.Wang says Disney will be no match for his ""wolf pack"" of parks.Disney did not immediately respond to request for comment, but it is betting on its years of experience running the world’s most successful parks, supported by its suite of movies, TV shows and merchandise.It will not want to repeat its experience in Hong Kong, where its smaller park lost HK$3.8 billion ($490 million) from 2008 to 2011, according to its Hong Kong government partner. The park turned a small profit from 2012 but fell back into the red last year. For its first foray into the mainland Chinese market, the company has tailored the new park to local tastes.Out goes “Main Street”, the idealized smalltown America at the heart of its other parks, and in comes a large garden featuring Disney’s take on the Chinese zodiac. It hired a retired PLA general to direct its Tarzan show at the park, and a mandarin-language version of the Lion King musical makes its debut at the opening ceremony.“Size, though, was very important because we wanted to make a very loud statement,"" CEO Iger told investors in May. At 963 acres, the site has two hotels, a 100-acre lake and the biggest and most interactive Disney castle yet.    Some characters also appear to have had a makeover, said New Boston-based Jim Hill, who writes a Disney fan blog. Mickey and Minnie Mouse are ""softer and rounder"", he said, making them appear more similar to popular Chinese characters.Some things haven't changed, though.Ultraman fan Li was among the more than a million people to visit the park during its ""soft opening"", and he voiced a familiar complaint - waiting time for the rides.""All the queues were really long and winding.

590,"  Corporate and individual donors have given more than $5.3 million to help victims of Sunday's mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Florida by a gunman who killed 49 people and wounded 53, organizers of fundraising drives said on Tuesday.U.S. investigators were digging into what motivated Omar Mateen, 29, to attack the Pulse dance club in downtown Orlando, including whether he was inspired by militant Islamist ideology and reports that he may have struggled with his own sexual identity.Mateen, a U.S. citizen who was born in New York to Afghan parents, was shot dead by police after a three-hour standoff.The gay rights group Equality Florida set up a page on the fundraising website GoFundMe.com, which had collected $3.6 million from more than 80,000 donors online as of Tuesday afternoon.""We do not know the total costs for the victims of this horrific hate crime, therefore are working to raise as much as possible and disperse the funds as fast as possible,"" Equality Florida said in a statement on the fundraising page. The group said it will work with the National Center for Victims of Crime to distribute the funds.A representative for Equality Florida could not immediately be reached for further comment.Separately, a campaign led by Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer has received donations including $1 million from the Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), which hosts millions of visitors a year at its Walt Disney World Resort in the Orlando area, company and city officials said.  Eligible donations from Disney employees will be also matched by a gifts program of the Walt Disney Company Foundation, the company said.""We are heartbroken by this tragedy and hope our commitment will help those in the community affected by this senseless act,"" Bob Chapek, chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, said in a statement.  Donations to the mayor's OneOrlandoFund will be distributed through the Central Florida Foundation and will support non-profit organizations that are supporting the victims and their families, the Hispanic community as well as the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community, Dyer said in a statement on the Orlando city website.Aside from Disney's contribution, at least $750,000 in other donations have been made to the OneOrlandoFund fund, Dyer said.

591,"   By Adam Jourdan | SHANGHAI  SHANGHAI Walt Disney Co has opened the gates to its first theme park in China, prompting a rush from thousands of gathered Mickey Mouse enthusiasts to be the first to storm Treasure Cove, ride the Roaring Rapids or visit Disney's tallest castle.    Disney's largest overseas investment at $5.5 billion, the park is a bet on China's middle class and booming domestic tourism. The U.S. firm hopes it will offset an otherwise lackluster international theme park business, better known for cash-burning sites such as Euro Disney.""This is one of the proudest and most exciting moments in the history of the Walt Disney Company,"" chief executive Bob Iger said at the official ribbon cutting ceremony on Thursday, where he was flanked by Chinese government officials.Iger and Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang read out letters of support from Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping.Not everything has gone quite to plan though.The opening gala - meant to be a bonanza of fireworks, live music and dance - was rained off on Wednesday night, while at Disney's park in Orlando, Florida, a young boy was grabbed by an alligator and killed.Disney, though, sees China as its biggest opportunity since Walt Disney bought land in Florida in the 1960s for what is now Walt Disney World - the world's most-visited theme park. With that in mind, Main Street has been replaced by Mickey Avenue to reduce the feel of Americana while attractions include the Chinese-style Wandering Moon tea house, a Chinese Zodiac-themed garden and a Tarzan musical featuring Chinese acrobats.Disney estimates 330 million people within a three-hour radius of Shanghai will be able to afford to come to the park: that includes Zhao Qiong, 36, who was one of the first visitors inside the park on Thursday with her 4-year-old daughter.""Since she was young, my little girl has always loved Disney princesses, so I wanted to bring her to the park to fulfill her dream,"" she told Reuters. ALREADY EXPANDING The iconic U.S. firm is already expanding the Shanghai site to keep the home crowd keen, in a country where competition from a plethora of local theme parks promises to be fierce.""There is actually construction going on this week. When we open we will continue the construction to expand what's on the opening day menu,"" said Iger, who first scoped out the seven square kilometer plot in 1999.""We have plenty of space to do that and we believe we've got willing partners ... We think we will probably do that sooner rather than later."" Shanghai Disney could also help lure more consumers to its hit films such as ""Zootopia"" and ""Captain America: Civil War"", which are among the top grossing films in China this year.Disney, though, is facing intense competition from homegrown parks and domestic cartoon characters. Consumers also have an ambivalent attitude to its products, with some being skeptical about American values overriding Chinese traditions and culture.Iger received a presidential welcome from Xi Jinping in May, and Disney has been granted ""special"" trademark protection. But China's main military newspaper has also warned that ""Zootopia"", a story about a rabbit police officer in an animal city, was a tool for spreading U.S. propaganda and ideals.Furthermore, Disney will have to share the spoils with its joint venture partner state-owned Shendi Group, which has a 57 percent stake - a concession agreed during lengthy negotiations. Shendi is a consortium controlled by four large government-owned companies: Shanghai Media Group; hotelier Jin Jiang International, controlled by the city of Shanghai; supermarket-to-department store operator Bailian Group, and property developer Lujiazui Development Group.

592,"   By Laila Kearney | June 16  June 16 The investigation into the death of a two-year-old boy likely drowned by an alligator at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida is ongoing but is not a criminal case, a spokeswoman for the local sheriff's office said on Thursday.Police divers recovered the body of toddler Lane Graves on Wednesday from the man-made lake where he had been snatched by the alligator as he played at the water's edge the night before, despite efforts by his parents to rescue him.""It's still an ongoing investigation,"" said Orange County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Rose Silva. ""It's not criminal in nature at this time,"" she said, declining to provide further details on the probe.A Disney spokeswoman said late on Wednesday that the company will review the posting of its signs which ban swimming in Seven Seas Lagoon - but do not warn specifically about alligators. Disney spokespeople could not immediately be reached on Thursday for further comment.The boy was grabbed by the reptile at about 9:15 p.m. on Tuesday while his family, who were on vacation from Nebraska, relaxed on the shore nearby, sheriff's officials said. His parents, Matt and Melissa Graves, tried to save the child but were unable to pry him from the animal's grip. The father suffered cuts to his arm in the struggle.The boy's body was later found intact underwater, and the presumption is that he was drowned by the alligator. The reptile that seized the toddler was believed to be between 4 and 7 feet (1.2 and 2 meters) long.Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission officials have caught and killed five of alligators from the lake to examine whether they were to blame. So far, none of the five has been determined to be the culprit.The incident, which prompted Disney temporarily to close the resort's beaches, came ahead of Thursday's opening of the company's first theme park in China, a $5.5 billion project in Shanghai that boasts Disney's tallest castle.Walt Disney Company shares were down about 1 percent at $97.07 in morning trade after last closing slightly up.

595,"   By Barbara Liston | ORLANDO, Fla.  ORLANDO, Fla. Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida, plans to install signs warning of alligators in the area where a 2-year-old boy was killed by one of the reptiles, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.Police divers recovered the body of Lane Graves on Wednesday from the man-made lake where he had been snatched by the alligator as he played at the water's edge the night before.The resort had ""No Swimming"" signs where the boy was killed at the Seven Seas Lagoon, but did not specifically mention alligators. A source with knowledge of the situation said the resort now plans to install signs explicitly warning of the dangerous animals.The boy was grabbed by the reptile at the water's edge at about 9:15 p.m. on Tuesday while his family, on vacation from Omaha, Nebraska, relaxed on the shore nearby, authorities have said. His parents, Matt and Melissa Graves, tried to save the child but were unable to free him from the alligator's grip.A complete autopsy was conducted on Thursday afternoon on the body of the boy, which was found intact underwater.""The cause of death was ruled as a result of drowning and traumatic injuries,"" the Orange County Medical Examiner's Office said in a brief statement. It did not elaborate.Rose Silva, a spokeswoman for the Orange County Sheriff's Office, said on Thursday that a probe into the toddler's death was ongoing, but was not criminal in nature.  The Graves family released a statement praising local authorities and adding: ""Words cannot describe the shock and grief our family is experiencing over the loss of our son. We are devastated and ask for privacy during this extremely difficult time."" The aquatic predators often roll their larger prey beneath the surface until their victim stops breathing, experts say, and then stash the body away to eat later.Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) Chief Executive Bob Iger spoke with the family by telephone on Wednesday and expressed his sympathies, the company said.Disney spokeswoman Jacquee Wahler said on Thursday that resort beaches that were closed after the attack would be off-limits to guests until further notice.""All of our beaches are currently closed, and we are conducting a swift and thorough review of all of our processes and protocols,"" Wahler said in a statement. ""This includes the number, placement and wording of our signage and warnings."" SIXTH ALLIGATOR CAUGHT The alligator was believed to be between 4 and 7 feet (1.2 and 2 meters) long.Trappers killed and opened up five alligators on Wednesday for sign of the boy before his body was recovered.The trappers remained at the lagoon on Thursday after removing a sixth alligator from the water late on Wednesday in an effort to find the one that snatched the child, said Greg Workman, a spokesman for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.  The commission's executive director, Nick Wiley, has said there is a good chance they have already captured the alligator in question. But officials said the search would go on until that was proved by forensic tests such as DNA studies, teeth measurements and comparison of bite marks.Workman said the commission also has wildlife officers on the scene around the clock. He said they are searching all day, but especially at night when alligators are more active because of cooler temperatures and less human activity.Disney shares gained 11 cents to close at $98.38 on Thursday. Its Orlando resort is the most visited theme park in the world, drawing more than 20 million visitors last year.The incident came ahead of Thursday's opening of the company's first theme park in China, a $5.5 billion project in Shanghai that boasts Disney's tallest castle.The attack happened on a beach by Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa, an upmarket property just one stop from the Magic Kingdom on Walt Disney World's monorail.The hotel's website - showing rooms starting at $569 a night before taxes - says guests can enjoy diversions such as ""bask on the white-sand beach.""

602,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 07 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to The Walt  Disney Company's (Disney) offering of benchmark-sized three-, 10, and 30-year  senior unsecured notes.  The Rating Outlook is Stable. The proceeds from the  offering are expected to be used for general corporate purpose including the  repayment of outstanding debt.   Fitch currently rates Disney's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A'.  Approximately  $21.1 billion of debt was outstanding as of April 2, 2016, including $3.1  billion of commercial paper (CP). A full list of ratings follows at the end of  this release. Disney's capital structure and credit protection metrics remain consistent and  within Fitch's expectations for the current rating. Consolidated leverage of  1.2x as of the latest 12 months (LTM) period ended April 2, 2016, is in line  with fiscal year-end 2015 and 2014 metrics. Going forward, Fitch believes  leverage will range between 1x and 1.4x during the ratings horizon after  consideration for a modest increase in debt levels related to the higher level  of share repurchases. KEY RATING DRIVERS Significant Financial Flexibility: Disney's operating profile positions the  company to generate free cash flow (FCF) in excess of $3.5 billion annually  during the ratings horizon, which coupled with strong liquidity and solid credit  metrics provides the company with considerable financial flexibility at the  current ratings. Disney's investment cycle within its Parks and Resorts segment  is expected to increase capital spending to approximately $5 billion during  fiscal 2016, which will temporarily hamper FCF generation. Consistent Financial Policy: Given the strength of Disney's underlying  businesses, strong liquidity position and Fitch's FCF expectations, Disney has  the financial flexibility to accommodate a higher level of share repurchases,  which are expected to range between $6 billion and $8 billion during fiscal  2016, in a manner consistent with its current ratings. Ratings incorporate  Fitch's expectations that the company's share repurchases and M&A activity will  likely exceed FCF generation given strong liquidity and the current credit  profile. Leading Market Positions and Leveragability: Disney has a very consistent  investment strategy centered on creating or acquiring intellectual property and  content that is leverageable across Disney's various platforms. Disney is  uniquely positioned, relative to its peers, to capitalize and monetize its  internally or externally developed franchises and brands, which in turn  strengthens the company's operating and credit profile and provides Disney with  a sustainable competitive advantage. Strength of Cable Networks: Disney's strong portfolio of cable networks, ESPN in  particular, underlies the company's ratings. Fitch believes that the top-tier  channels will continue to be a must carry for the distributors and are likely to  retain pricing power. Disney's operating profile benefits from the stability,  recurring dual-stream revenue profile, high operating margin and FCF generation  characteristics attributable to its cable network business. Fitch expects this  segment will continue to generate a significant amount of Disney's cash flow. Credible Strategy to Address Threats: Disney's strong asset portfolio positions  the company to address the secular threats and opportunities presented by  emerging alternative distribution platforms and continued audience fragmentation  across the media and entertainment landscape.  Fitch does not anticipate any meaningful changes to Disney's financial policy  over the ratings horizon. Fitch believes Disney maintains an appropriate balance  between returning capital to shareholders, in the form of dividends and share  repurchases, and investing in the strategic needs of its business. In terms of  capital allocation priority, Fitch believes investing in internal opportunities  focused on organic growth, such as the company's investment in its various parks  and resorts worldwide and long term sports rights deals, takes precedence over  merger and acquisitions and shareholder returns. Fitch expects that Disney will manage the level of share repurchase activity in  a manner consistent with its current ratings and acknowledges that the company's  share repurchases and M&A activity will likely exceed FCF generation. Fitch  anticipates share repurchases to range between $6 billion and $8 billion during  fiscal 2016. Disney repurchased approximately 42 million shares of its common  stock for approximately $4.4 billion during the first six months of fiscal 2016.  As of April 2, 2016, the company had remaining authorization to repurchase  approximately 314 million additional shares.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case include: --The revenue growth within the company's cable networks business (Disney's  Media Networks segment) reflects the stability of the business and expected  affiliate fee increases. Fitch anticipates mid-single-digit affiliate revenue  growth.  --Disney's broadcasting business benefits from a stable economic and advertising  environment while incorporating typical political advertising revenue cycle.  Additionally, this segment will benefit from growing retransmission consent  fees. Revenue growth ranges between 2% during non-political years and 4% during  political years. --Programming expenses are expected to increase by high-single digits driven by  sports rights costs.  --Fitch assumes typical volatility within the Studio Entertainment, Parks and  Resort, and Consumer Products & Interactive Media operating segments.  --Domestic revenues grow faster than International revenues within the company's  Parks and Resort segment. Fitch incorporates start-up expenses related to the  opening of its Shanghai Disney Resort in 2016.  --Fitch expects low double digit growth within Disney's Studio Entertainment  segment this year due to the release of Star Wars and a strong 2016 film slate.  Theatrical revenues are slightly offset by a weaker Home Video release schedule  when compared to 2015. Home entertainment revenues will track the theatrical  success in 2017 and 2018. Television and SVOD revenues grow at a mid-single  digit pace while home entertainment revenues remain flat. --From a margin perspective, the base case assumes relatively flat margins  within the company's Media Networks segment as retransmission revenue gains  enhance broadcast margins while cable network margins remain stable reflecting  the company's ability to grow higher margin affiliate fee revenues at a similar  pace to increasing programming costs. Disney's pre-opening expenses related to  its Shanghai Disneyland opening are expected to be offset by strong domestic  operating performance leading to relatively flat margins within the company's  Parks and Resorts segment. Coming off a strong operating performance in fiscal  2015, margins within Studio Entertainment are expected to contract somewhat  during fiscal 2016.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Upward momentum to the ratings is unlikely over the intermediate term.  However, a compelling rationale for, and an explicit public commitment to, more  conservative leverage thresholds could result in upgrade consideration.  Negative: Negative rating actions are more likely to coincide with discretionary  actions of Disney's management rather than by operating performance, reflecting  the company's significant financial flexibility. Decisions that increase  leverage beyond 1.75x in the absence of a credible plan to reduce leverage will  likely lead to a negative rating action. LIQUIDITY Disney's liquidity position and financial flexibility remain strong and is  supported by significant FCF generation as well as $6 billion of aggregate  available borrowing capacity (as of April 2, 2016) under three credit  facilities. Commitments under these credit facilities support the company's $6  billion CP program and expire during March 2017 ($1.5 billion), March 2019  ($2.25 billion) and March 2021 ($2.25 billion). In addition, the company had  approximately $5 billion of cash on hand as of April 2, 2016. Scheduled  maturities are well laddered and manageable considering FCF generation  expectations and access to capital markets.  Disney has approximately $1.5 billion of debt scheduled to mature during the  remainder of its fiscal 2016 followed by $2.2 billion during fiscal 2017. Fitch  does not expect debt reduction going forward. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates Disney as follows: The Walt Disney Company --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A'; --Senior unsecured revolvers 'A'; --Short-Term IDR 'F1'; --Commercial paper 'F1'. ABC Inc. --IDR 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A'. Disney Enterprises, Inc. --IDR 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A'. Total debt as of April 2, 2016 was approximately $21.1 billion and consisted of: --$3.1 billion of commercial paper (CP); --$16.4 billion of notes and debentures, with maturities ranging from August  2016 to 2093; --$818 million of debt related to international theme bark borrowings, which is  non-recourse back to Disney but which Fitch consolidates under the assumption  that the company would back the loan payments;  --Approximately $791 million of foreign currency-denominated debt, including the  debt related to the acquisition of UTV. Fitch links the IDRs of the issuing entities (predominantly based on the lack of  any material restrictions on movements of cash between the entities) and treats  the unsecured debt of the entire company as pari passu. Fitch recognizes the  absence of upstream guarantees from the operating assets and that debt at Disney  Enterprises is structurally senior to the holding company debt. However, we do  not distinguish the issue ratings at the two entities due to the strong 'A'  category-investment grade IDR, Fitch's expectations of stable financial  policies, and the anticipation that future debt will be issued by Walt Disney  Company. Fitch would consider distinguishing between the ratings if we viewed  there to be heightened risk of the company's IDR falling to non-investment grade  (where Disney Enterprises' enhanced recovery prospects would be more relevant).

605,"   By Subrat Patnaik  Hasbro Inc (HAS.O) reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue, driven by strong demand for Disney Princess and Frozen dolls and action figures based on ""Star Wars"" movies.However, the toymaker's shares fell as much as 7.6 percent in noon trading on Monday, which analysts attributed to factors such as slowing sales of toys targeted at boys, inflated Street expectations and a near 30 percent runup in the stock this year. Sales growth in toys targeted at boys - Hasbro's largest business - dropped to 4 percent in the second quarter from 24-32 percent in the prior three quarters. The category accounts for more than a third of total revenue.The ""sharp slowdown"" in sales growth in the category was ""worrisome"", Jefferies analyst Trevor Young said. Chief Executive Brian Goldner said the category was hit due to a massive drop in sales of toys based on ""Jurassic Park"" and ""Jurassic World"" films and Hasbro would no longer make ""Jurassic Park"" toys from the end of 2017. Revenue from toys targeted at girls jumped 35 percent as Hasbro benefited from demand for dolls based on Walt Disney Co's (DIS.N) princesses such as Cinderella and Snow White. Hasbro acquired the rights to make these dolls in 2014 and started selling them this year.GREAT EXPECTATIONS  Hasbro's quarterly sales beat analysts' expectations by a margin of 2.3 percent, compared with 3-8 percent in five of the prior six quarters, according to Thomson Reuters data.Investors were getting accustomed to a big beat and this ""straight down the middle fairway"" quarter feels like a disappointment, Piper Jaffray & Co analyst Stephanie Wissink said. ""If I was a long-term investor in this story, what happened today would not shake my confidence."" Goldner said on a conference call that Hasbro would start shipping toys based on ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" in the current quarter. Dolls based on DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc's DWA.O movie ""Trolls"" will hit the stores in August. Goldner also said Britain's vote to exit the European Union had created some near-term uncertainty, but Hasbro was yet to see any negative impact. The net income attributable to Hasbro jumped 24.6 percent to $52.1 million, or 41 cents per share, in the quarter ended June 26, while revenue rose 10 percent to $878.9 million.Analysts on average had expected earnings of 39 cents per share and revenue of $859 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The technology is lauded as some of the best in the industry and is used by HBO Now and the National Hockey League as well as baseball.The investment will help ""allay investors fears about Disney's relevance in a world where content is delivered online,"" Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser said.""That said, I think it doesn't do anything specifically to allay fears of unbundling"" of cable networks,"" he said.Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger described the coming ESPN online service as complementary to its TV channels. Programming will include Major League Baseball and National Hockey League games already licensed to BAMTech, he said. ""Our goal is to ensure that our brands, notably ESPN, remain strong, vital and relevant in a totally changed media landscape,"" Iger said of the investment. For the June quarter, Disney's movie and theme parks divisions topped expectations, although a rise in cable networks revenue and operating profit was slightly below Wall Street targets, according to FactSet StreetAccount. (For earnings graphic see, tmsnrt.rs/1MfhspW)Shares of Disney fell about 2 percent in extended trade.Revenue at Disney's cable networks business rose 1.4 percent to $4.20 billion in the third quarter ended July 2, but missed an analyst consensus of $4.31 billion. ESPN — the company's cash cow — drove the increase in cable networks operating income due to affiliate and advertising revenue growth, although the number of subscribers fell and programming costs rose.""The Jungle Book"" and ""Captain America: Civil War"" fueled gains at the movie studio, with revenue increasing 39.6 percent to $2.85 billion. Operating income rose 62 percent to $766 million.  Revenue at its theme park and resorts business was up 6 percent to $4.38 billion. The net income attributable to the company rose to $2.6 billion, or $1.59 per share, in the third quarter, from $2.48 billion, or $1.45 per share, a year earlier.Revenue rose to $14.28 billion from $13.10 billion.Excluding items, the company earned $1.62 per share.Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.61 per share and revenue of $14.15 billion.Disney's shares fell to $94.92 in extended trade on Tuesday, down from a close of $96.67.

BakerSAN FRANCISCO, Sept 27 With speculation mounting that Twitter Inc will soon have a new corporate owner, the 10-year-old social networking service - which has long struggled to define its core purpose -may end up heading in one of several distinctly different directions depending on who ends up paying for it.Companies including Salesforce.com Inc, Walt Disney Co and Alphabet Inc's Google have shown interest in Twitter, which is working with investment banks to evaluate its options, according to people familiar with the matter.With Salesforce.com, Twitter might turn its focus to customer service communications and mining its database of tweets for business intelligence. Google would likely be most interested in the social and news dimensions of Twitter. Disney, by contrast, might see it as a way to expand the reach of its sports and entertainment programming.It is not clear how quickly Twitter might approach a sale, but it is moving to formalize the process, sources have said. A deal is by no means assured in light of the company's uncertain financial prospects and steep price tag - its market value is more than $16 billion after talk of a sale drove the stock up over the past few days.Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey, speaking at a conference in Washington on Monday, declined to comment on possible sale talks.CORPORATE ROUTE? Salesforce.com, run by CEO Marc Benioff, is focused on cloud-based sales and marketing software; unlike Twitter, its main product is aimed at businesses users, not consumers. Under Salesforce.com, Twitter could become a corporate tool used to power sentiment analysis and nurture customer relationships.Salesforce.com already uses the Twitter ""firehose"" for its new artificial intelligence platform, Einstein. ""It would give them the social graph and a better idea of how social media relates to its customers,"" said Ryan Holmes, chief executive of Hootsuite, a private technology firm that helps brands and consumers manage their social media accounts.Holmes also said that if Salesforce.com owned all of Twitter's data, it could have better insights into what sort of conversations companies such as airlines or telecom firms might be having with their customers and thereby gain more understanding of their business challenges.But many Twitter users - especially newer ones - are not active tweeters, which over time could limit the value of the data Twitter can provide. Salesforce.com could also likely gain much of the benefit of Twitter's data from licensing its trove of tweets as opposed to buying the whole company.Salesforce.com investors are already spooked by the speculation it could acquire Twitter: its shares are down 6  percent since news of the company's interest flared up last week. GOOGLE AD PLAN Twitter would fit easily with Google's online advertising-driven business model. Ads could be sold across paid search, YouTube, display and mobile on Twitter - while filling a gap for Google, which has struggled with social media.""Google already has the eyeballs with advertisers. Cross-selling to the Twitter inventory could be an amazing play for them,"" Hootsuite's Holmes said.Google, which has expertise in monitoring its video service YouTube, would know how to deal with the tricky policy issues facing Twitter, such as abusive tweets and censorship. Still, such a tie-up faces potentially fatal regulatory hurdles, analysts said. In Europe, where the company has a bigger share of the search market than in the United States, the company is already facing two antitrust investigations.""Google could help Twitter's user acquisition problem. The unknown is whether regulators in the United States and European Union would allow the transaction,"" said BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield.Facebook Inc, meanwhile, has been trying to replicate Twitter on its own platform and could also face antitrust challenges if it tried to buy the company, Greenfield said. So far Facebook has not been mentioned as a potential buyer, but with its large cash reserves and penchant for surprise moves it cannot be counted out.THE MEDIA PLAY Twitter's foray into live streaming of National Football League games and its presence in news gathering could interest media companies such as Disney, which owns sports channel ESPN.Twitter's presence on mobile devices could help any media company, all of which are struggling to find mobile growth, according to BTIG's Greenfield.

625,"  Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) shares plunged on Thursday as fears mounted that a much-anticipated auction of the social media company will draw minimal interest from potential buyers.With stagnant user growth and continuing losses, Twitter's board agreed last month to consider a sale, and has told potential acquirers it wants such deliberations to conclude by the time it reports third-quarter earnings on Oct. 27, Reuters reported on Wednesday.Technology website Recode reported later on Wednesday that Alphabet Inc's Google (GOOGL.O), long considered the most logical buyer for Twitter, and Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) would not bid for the social network, leaving cloud software company Salesforce.com (CRM.N) as the only known suitor.Twitter shares fell as much as 19.2 percent to $20.10, valuing the company at about $14.2 billion. They closed 20.1 percent lower at $19.87.Salesforce Chief Executive Mark Benioff has publicly expressed his interest in Twitter in recent days, but stopped short of saying the company had decided on a bid. Analysts said he downplayed the possibility in a meeting with investors on Wednesday, sending Salesforce shares up about 4 percent.  ""I'm not saying I'm buying it, but I'm not saying I'm not buying it,"" Benioff said on Wednesday in an interview with the New York Times.Even at $20, Twitter shares are well above the $14 they were trading at before speculation about a possible acquisition began to emerge this spring. Many investors and analysts believe Twitter remains expensive for most potential buyers, but the company does not have a clear back-up plan if it is not acquired.Product initiatives under CEO Jack Dorsey, who returned to the company a year ago but also remains CEO of payment company Square, have borne little fruit. Large amounts of employee stock and options are also considered an obstacle for some potential bidders.The rationale for Salesforce bidding on Twitter is not clear, said Jefferies analyst John DiFucci in a note to clients. Buying Twitter would reduce the value of Salesforce shares by about $11 through dilution, while increased debt could cut another $9.50 from the stock.  Other potential bidders beyond Salesforce are taking a look at Twitter, CNBC said, citing sources.Apple Inc (AAPL.O) has also been rumored as a possible bidder, though Recode reported that Apple would not move forward.

Crude futures prices have risen nearly 15 percent over the past seven sessions.""Energy is a positive input, the bottoming in energy prices,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.  However, he said, traders were in wait-and-see mode ahead of the payrolls data. ""It all is a prelude to the jobs number,"" he said.The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 12.53 points, or 0.07 percent, to 18,268.5, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 1.04 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,160.77 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 9.17 points, or 0.17 percent, to 5,306.85. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.26-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.54-to-1 ratio favored decliners.About 6.32 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 7.1 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.Twitter (TWTR.N) shares plunged 20.1 percent to $19.87 as fears mounted that a much-anticipated auction of the social media company will draw minimal interest from potential buyers. Technology news website Recode said Disney (DIS.N) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) would not bid for the company. Wal-Mart (WMT.N) dropped 3.2 percent to $69.36 and weighed the most on the S&P 500 after the world's largest retailer forecast flat earnings for next year.The largest percentage gainer on the S&P 500 was Whole Foods (WFM.O), which rose 4.9 percent to $29.33.  About 6.35 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 7.1 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and 6 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 75 new highs and 28 new lows.

631,"   By Liana B. Baker and Jessica Toonkel  Twitter Inc has told potential acquirers it is seeking to conclude negotiations about selling itself by the time it reports third-quarter earnings on Oct. 27, according to people familiar with the matter.The timeline is hugely ambitious in the context of most mergers and acquisitions, given that Twitter began mulling a sale only last month. It is the clearest sign yet that Chief Executive Jack Dorsey is pushing to provide clarity to shareholders and employees over the company's future as quickly as possible.Binding acquisition offers are due in the next two weeks, and Twitter has already whittled down the field of potential acquirers, the people said this week. Salesforce.com Inc is in the running, while Google parent Alphabet Inc, and Walt Disney Co have also been contemplating bids, the people added.Recode reported on Wednesday, citing sources it did not identify, that Google would not move forward with a bid to acquire Twitter.It is not certain the process will result in a sale, the Reuters sources cautioned. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential.    Twitter and Salesforce declined to comment. Disney and Google did not return requests for comment.With Salesforce.com, Twitter might turn its focus to customer service communications and mining its database of tweets for business intelligence. Google would likely be most interested in the social and news dimensions of Twitter. Disney, by contrast, might see it as a way to expand the reach of its sports and entertainment programming. Twitter has struggled to generate revenue growth and profit, despite having some 313 million average monthly active users and a growing presence as a source of news. The company missed Wall Street's sales expectations in both the first and second quarters of 2016, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine, and has yet to produce a net profit in 11 quarters as a public company.It has also failed to keep pace with rivals, notably Facebook Inc's Instagram and Snapchat. Both now boast more users than Twitter by most measures, even though they are much newer, and advertisers have begun to migrate their ad dollars accordingly. Dorsey, who returned to Twitter as chief executive more than a year ago, has been part of Disney's board since 2013.Twitter went public in November 2013 at $26 a share. The shares peaked above $74 just over a month after its IPO, but have been on a steady downward trajectory since.  (Reporting by Liana B.

640,"   By Tom Bergin | LONDON  LONDON The drop in sterling and some weakening in demand following the vote to leave the European Union have eaten into the earnings of foreign firms operating in Britain, companies have been saying as they reveal their third quarter results this month.Firms including carmaker Ford, technology group HP Inc, Ryanair and Delta Air Lines Inc, said Britain’s vote to leave the EU, or Brexit, was forcing them to reassess profit targets, plan additional cost cuts, increase prices in Britain and curtail operations.Large listed firms are beginning to report profits for the July to September period -- the first full quarter’s earnings since Britain’s June 23 referendum on EU membership, which sent the value of sterling to a record low against a basket of currencies.While many domestic-focused British companies have reported resilient earnings since the Brexit vote, foreign companies are suffering because the profits they make in the UK are now worth much less in dollars or euros.“Translating sterling back into their own currency is a negative,” said Ian Williams, Economist & Strategist at Peel Hunt stockbrokers in London.He added that if companies believed the drop would persist, it could prompt them to freeze or cut investments in Britain: “The question is whether they want to maintain the degree of exposure to the UK that they have done historically.""India’s Tata Consulting, which offers outsourcing services to UK companies, told investors last week that earnings were suffering after a drop in the value of the pound from 95 to 81 rupees.Toolmaker Stanley Black & Decker said it revised its estimate of currency impacts to reflect the weaker pound and U.S. Toymaker Hasbro Inc, which manufactures Disney character dolls, told investors on Monday it faced a $25 million hit from currency headwinds -- primarily due to the UK pound -- in the fourth quarter. Irish budget airline Ryanair (RYA.I) cut its forecast for its profit growth this year to 7 percent from 12 percent on Tuesday citing the weaker pound. EXPORTERS HIT TOO The weak pound has been celebrated as a boon for exporters, whose sterling-based costs are reduced relative to their foreign-currency revenues. But even foreign companies with export-orientated manufacturing operations in the UK have been hit. Carmaker Ford which has engine-making plants in Dagenham and Bridgend said last month that currency and GDP weakness following Brexit would weigh on European earnings.“Brexit we think in the short term, [will hit Ford’s margins by] a couple hundred million dollars this year,” Jim Farley vice president for Europe, Middle East & Africa said at an investor presentation.“We think it's going to be more like $600 million next year,” he added. Many foreign companies echoed comments from UK businesses which said they saw no major fall-off in demand from consumers post-Brexit. Yet some foreign companies selling to other businesses said they felt customers were now more hesitant to make big ticket purchases.“There is a sense of anxiety and that is still obviously continuing,” Vishal Sikka, CEO of outsourcing group Infosys Ltd.(INFY.NS) said on an investor call. Tata said it also saw weaker growth than it had expected before Brexit.PRICING POWER Many foreign companies said they aimed to offset the lower value of sterling by charging their customers more. Peel Hunt’s Williams said the biggest Brexit losers would be those companies without the power to push through price increases. Luxury goods maker LVMH said it had increased UK prices by 5 percent twice this year, without any drop in demand. Ford (F.N) said it had increased prices by 1.3 percent, helped by the fact that rivals Peugeot and Renault had done likewise. But even then, Ford said it only expects “some of that Brexit headwind” to be offset by this. Companies said they were also responding by intensified cost-cutting.“Given the continued headwinds due to competition, foreign currency and market sizing, we are driving another set of productivity improvements in fiscal 2017,” Cathie Lesjak HP Inc’s chief financial officer told investors last week.A few are scaling back operations. Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) said it was cutting capacity on Transatlantic routes.But for now, companies downplayed any imminent plans to slash UK investment and relocate plants or people to other countries. Most said they were waiting to see the terms of Britain’s exit from the EU and what kind of access to the single market the UK will enjoy in future.“We've developed plans based upon various scenarios and we are going to have to wait and see how everything unfolds to know what we are going to do,” Paul Donofrio, chief financial officer of Bank of America, (BAC.N) said on Monday.

641,"   By Giulia Segreti | MILAN  MILAN Mediaset said on Thursday Vivendi had told it in a letter that an interim management accord over its pay-TV unit no longer stood, prompting the Italian broadcaster to blame the French media group for paralyzing the unit's operations.Mediaset said Vivendi's letter, dated Oct. 18, sought to avoid further damage after Mediaset Premium TV was unable to make key investment decisions and prepare its subscription and football campaigns.The two companies have been locked in a months-long feud since Vivendi in July backed out of a deal struck in April to buy Mediaset's pay-TV arm.Mediaset, controlled by former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, said the letter came too late after Mediaset Premium had suffered ""enormous"" damage because of the organizational paralysis.""The main consequence of today's formal letter is the implicit recognition of the validity of the existing contract,"" Mediaset said. Vivendi declined to comment.The interim management accord had been struck as part of the April deal which envisaged the finalization of the sale by Sept. 30. The French company, led by Vincent Bollore, backed away from the deal to give it full control of Mediaset Premium, part of Vivendi's plans to create a European media giant. Vivendi said on Wednesday it was no longer keen on finding an amicable solution to the dispute with Mediaset, which last week had asked a court to order the seizure of a 3.5 percent stake in Vivendi.The Italian broadcaster is also suing Vivendi for damages and is asking Milan judges to enforce the pay-TV contract.    According to one source close to the matter, Premium TV did not renew a contract to air two Disney channels after it expired in July and is cutting spending to a minimum on its advertising campaign for the Christmas season.""The impasse has already damaged them on the market and in the interim they will have problems with advertising and new investments,""  a Milan-based analyst, who did not want to be named, said. Mediaset has lost 19.5 percent -  or 700 million euros from its market capitalization - since Vivendi's change of heart over the Premium deal.On Thursday, its stock shed as much as 6 percent. Shares closed 3.4 percent lower at 2.62 euros. ""The market has already shown it does not appreciate the prospect of a long legal battle with Vivendi,"" broker ICBPI said in a report.A decision on Mediaset's request to seize Vivendi shares is set for Nov. 8. The first hearing on the contract enforcement will be on March 21. But a final ruling, in a system which envisages up to two appeals, could take years. The deadlock with Vivendi also raises questions over whether Mediaset Premium will be able to bid for two soccer TV rights tenders for Italy's top Serie A league and for Europe's Champion's league which are due to be held in spring next year. In 2014, Mediaset spent an estimated 700 million euros for the right to air Champions League soccer matches in Italy for the three seasons starting in 2015.

643,"   By Jessica Toonkel  Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google has reached an agreement with CBS Corp (CBS.N) to carry the network on its planned web TV service and is in advanced talks with 21st Century Fox (FOXA.O), Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) and Viacom Inc (VIAB.O) to distribute their channels, people with knowledge of the talks told Reuters on Wednesday.The service, which will be part of Google's YouTube platform, is expected to launch in the first quarter and will include all of CBS's content, including live NFL games, one of the sources said.Google's offering, known as a ""skinny bundle"" because it will have fewer channels than a typical cable subscription, will cost $30 to $40 a month, the source said. It was unclear which Fox and Viacom networks would be part of the Google service, two of the sources said.The sources requested anonymity because the discussions are confidential. A spokesperson for YouTube declined to comment. A representative at Disney was not immediately available for comment. CBS, Viacom and Fox declined to comment.Google will be launching into an increasingly crowded market. Dish Network Corp (DISH.O) and Sony Corp <6758.T in the past year have launched skinny bundles delivered over the internet to appeal to younger viewers who do not want to pay for cable.Both AT&T Inc (T.N) and Hulu, the online video service owned by Disney, Fox, Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), have streaming television offerings that are expected to go live in the next few months. Traditional cable operators also have unveiled smaller packages to fight ""cord cutting"" by consumers who are dropping their more expensive packages with hundreds of channels.The Wall Street Journal first reported the news. (on.wsj.com/2eShhLp) Google has been talking to media companies about its web TV for years, but its plans have just ramped up over the past few months, one of the sources said.

644,"   By Malathi Nayak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK AT&T Inc's upcoming DirecTV Now online video service will cost $35 per month, including mobile streaming costs, and target viewers who shun pay-television subscriptions, Chief Executive Randall Stephenson said on Tuesday.The wireless company's streaming video service, which launches late next month, will have more than 100 channels, Stephenson said at the WSJ.D Live conference in California. AT&T said on Saturday that it would buy Time Warner Inc for $85.4 billion, as it looks to diversify its business into the media and entertainment market.The Time Warner deal gives AT&T control of cable TV channels HBO and CNN, film studio Warner Bros and other coveted media assets. Time Warner content will be incorporated into the upcoming video service, Stephenson said. ""Thirty-five dollars, you don't find that for a hundred channels in the marketplace, with wireless streaming,"" Stephenson said. AT&T is betting big on mobile video to tap new revenue as the U.S. wireless market stagnates. AT&T acquired DirecTV for $48.5 billion in 2015, making it the largest U.S. pay-TV operator with 25.3 million video subscribers. AT&T is entering a crowded market that services viewers who increasingly consume video online rather than through cable and satellite television services. Dish Network Corp's Sling TV offers about two dozen channels for $20 a month, while Sony Corp's PlayStation Vue has packages as big as 100-plus channels for $55 a month.Online video service Hulu will roll out a new live TV bundle of broadcast and cable network channels early next year. AT&T has said that DirecTV Now will have content from partners including Walt Disney Co, Viacom Inc and Scripps Networks Interactive.

651,"  SAN FRANCISCO Twitter Inc said on Wednesday that Chief Operating Officer Adam Bain, widely credited with building a robust advertising business at the company even as it struggled with user growth, is leaving to explore other opportunities.""Mr. Bain will remain at Twitter in the coming weeks to assist with the transition of the chief operating officer role,"" the company said.The move is a blow for struggling Twitter, which has hired bankers to field acquisition offers but has seen a dearth of potential bidders. The company said last month it would cut 9 percent of its global workforce to keep costs down.Twitter shares were down 4.3 percent in after-hours trading.Bain will be replaced by Chief Financial Officer Anthony Noto, the company said, adding it would begin a search for a new CFO.Noto, who became the finance chief in 2014, will continue to manage the live content business as well as Twitter's global advertising sales, data and mobile ad exchange MoPub. Bain joined Twitter in 2010 when it had almost no revenue  and built an advertising sales machine that generated some $2.2 billion last year. A popular executive who was once considered a possible chief executive for the company, Bain was named COO in October last year.""I think Adam Bain is the most competent person at Twitter,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter. ""The one part of the business that actually worked was the part he works on, which is advertising."" In announcing his departure on Twitter, Bain heaped praise on CEO Jack Dorsey and added: ""I'm excited to take w me everything I've experienced at Twitter & do something totally different and new outside the company. Stay tuned!"" Twitter has assumed a central role in public conversations around the world and U.S. President-elect Donald J. Trump made it a centerpiece of his controversial election campaign.But the company has struggled to make the service appealing to a broad audience and has been unable to address problems with abuse and harassment on the platform, which unlike rival Facebook allows people to remain anonymous.With user growth stagnant at a little over 300 million compared to 1.7 billion for Facebook, Twitter has seen its stock price plunge to below $18 from a peak of $69 in early 2014. The company went public at $26 in 2013. Companies including Salesforce.com Inc, Walt Disney Co and Alphabet Inc considered an acquisition of Twitter earlier this year, sources said, but all three decided not to pursue a deal.Twitter has long had turmoil in the executive suite and a number of executives have departed since Dorsey returned as permanent CEO last year.Pachter said he believed the latest moves were part of Twitter's efforts to sell itself. Noto is highly regarded on Wall Street, he noted.

658,"   By Lisa Richwine and Arunima Banerjee  Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) executives promised earnings growth for the next two years, easing investor concerns over a quarterly drop in ad sales and subscribers at its ESPN sports network, sending the media company's shares up in after-hours trading.Executives said they expected modest earnings per share growth in fiscal 2017 and ""more robust growth"" in fiscal 2018 and beyond, as ESPN attracts more online viewers, the new Shanghai theme park lures visitors and the movie studio releases more ""Star Wars"" installments and other films.The company's stock rose 2.7 percent to $97.25 after hours.Disney and media rivals face challenges from ""cord cutters"" who are dropping TV subscriptions for cheaper and more convenient online services, and the issue is especially important for ESPN, one of Disney's most important brands. Excluding items, the company earned $1.10 per share in the latest quarter, missing the $1.16 consensus forecast of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Shares dropped immediately after the report, but revived after executives' comments on growth in a call to analysts.""We are extremely confident that we'll continue to deliver significant long-term growth,"" Chief Executive Bob Iger said.The future of ESPN has been in focus since August 2015 when Iger acknowledged ""modest"" subscriber losses at the sports network.   On Thursday, Iger said the company had taken ""a more bullish position on the future of ESPN's (subscriber) base.""""To some extent, the causes of those losses have abated, notably the migration to smaller packages"" that do not include ESPN, Iger said. New digital services ""are going to offer ESPN opportunities they haven't had to reach more people,"" he said.The strength of ESPN has been a concern on Wall Street, said BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield. ""There is nothing in the release that changes investor views that ESPN is the struggling division,"" Greenfield said.

659,"   By Lisa Richwine and Arunima Banerjee  Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) executives promised earnings growth for the next two years, easing investor concerns over a quarterly drop in ad sales and subscribers at its ESPN sports network, sending the media company's shares up in after-hours trading.Executives said they expected modest earnings per share growth in fiscal 2017 and ""more robust growth"" in fiscal 2018 and beyond, as ESPN attracts more online viewers, the new Shanghai theme park lures visitors and the movie studio releases more ""Star Wars"" installments and other films.The company's stock rose 2.7 percent to $97.25 after hours.Disney and media rivals face challenges from ""cord cutters"" who are dropping TV subscriptions for cheaper and more convenient online services, and the issue is especially important for ESPN, one of Disney's most important brands. Excluding items, the company earned $1.10 per share in the latest quarter, missing the $1.16 consensus forecast of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Shares dropped immediately after the report, but revived after executives' comments on growth in a call to analysts.""We are extremely confident that we'll continue to deliver significant long-term growth,"" Chief Executive Bob Iger said.The future of ESPN has been in focus since August 2015 when Iger acknowledged ""modest"" subscriber losses at the sports network.   On Thursday, Iger said the company had taken ""a more bullish position on the future of ESPN's (subscriber) base.""""To some extent, the causes of those losses have abated, notably the migration to smaller packages"" that do not include ESPN, Iger said. New digital services ""are going to offer ESPN opportunities they haven't had to reach more people,"" he said.The strength of ESPN has been a concern on Wall Street, said BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield. ""There is nothing in the release that changes investor views that ESPN is the struggling division,"" Greenfield said. The company has been investing in share buybacks rather than addressing the problem at ESPN, he added.

660,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, November 15 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Symetra Life Insurance  Company's (Symetra Life) Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) rating at 'A'. Fitch  has also affirmed the Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of Symetra Financial  Corporation (Symetra) at 'A-' and the ratings of all outstanding debt. The  Rating Outlook is Stable. A complete list of rating actions follows at the end  of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Symetra's ratings reflect its strong balance sheet, diversified earnings,  moderate financial leverage. Additional strengths include the company's strong  competitive position in the group medical stop-loss market and fixed annuities  sold through banks. The ratings also reflect its above-average interest rate  risk.  The ratings consider Symetra's status as a wholly-owned subsidiary of  Japan-based Sumitomo Life Insurance Company (Sumitomo). Fitch rates Sumitomo's  IFS and IDR at 'A' with a Negative Outlook. Sumitomo's IFS rating is currently  constrained by Japan's Long-Term Local Currency IDR ('A'/Outlook Negative), and  is one notch below its unadjusted IFS rating of 'A+'.  Based on Fitch's criteria, Symetra's strategic importance level is 'Very  Important' within the Sumitomo enterprise, reflecting its position as its  parent's U.S. platform. This along with its standalone credit profile, which  Fitch views as in line with an 'A' IFS rating, results in Symetra Life carrying  the same IFS rating as Sumitomo. In the event of a one notch downgrade to the  Japanese sovereign rating, Fitch would likely affirm Symetra's ratings, due to  its lack of direct exposure to Japan and the issues constraining its sovereign  rating. The standalone credit profile also considers Symetra's exposure to the  protracted low interest rate environment. Fitch believes that with its liability  mix, particularly its large legacy structured settlement and bank owned life  insurance book, Symetra is more exposed to interest rate risk than peers.  Fitch views Symetra Life's risk-adjusted capital as strong for the rating and  considers the growth in statutory surplus adequate. The company's RBC ratio  decreased in 1H16 to an estimated 411% from 424% as of year-end 2015. However,  RBC remains both strong for the rating level and above management's target of  350%. Symetra's Prism capital model score in 2015 was 'Strong', which is  consistent with the rating level.  Symetra's financial leverage declined to 16% as of June 30, 2016, largely due to  purchase accounting adjustments whereby shareholders' equity was set equal to  Sumitomo's purchase price, leading to a $1.3 billion increase in shareholders'  equity, excluding net unrealized gains, from year-end 2015. Fitch views the  company's use of financial leverage as reasonable considering its profile and  rating level. Total financings and commitments (TFC) remains modest at 0.3x.  Through June 30, 2016, Symetra's post-tax operating income was $23.8 million,  down from the prior year as a result of purchase accounting adjustments. The  benefits division loss ratio increased to 71% in Q2'16 from 66% in the prior  year period due to higher severity and increased frequency of claims. Fixed  indexed annuity sales remain strong, but could face headwinds from the  Department of Labor's fiduciary rule. Margin compression persists in the  protracted low interest rate environment.  Symetra's risky asset ratio of 71% remained below the industry (80%) at year-end  2015, due to its below-average Schedule BA exposure, which is partially offset  by its above-average common stock exposure. The company's bond portfolio is  overweight 'BBB' rated bonds, but its exposure to below investment grade bonds  is in line with the industry. Commercial mortgages comprise 16% of its invested  assets, moderately above the industry's 11%, but the portfolio is of high  quality and considered a good match for its long-dated liabilities.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Symetra Life's IFS rating could be upgraded one notch above Sumitomo's IFS  rating if its standalone credit profile improved to 'A+'. As a 'Very Important'  subsidiary of Sumitomo, Symetra Life's IFS rating could also be upgraded in  conjunction with an upgrade of the parent. Given that Sumitomo's ratings have a  Negative Outlook, an upgrade of Symetra Life for this reason is unlikely in the  near term. In the event of a one notch downgrade of the parent's IFS rating to  'A-', Symetra Life could maintain its current 'A' IFS rating per Fitch's  criteria. As a 'Very Important' subsidiary of Sumitomo, Symetra Life's IFS  rating could be downgraded below the parent's IFS rating if its standalone  assessment is downgraded by three or more notches.  Symetra's holding company ratings are somewhat constrained by Sumitomo's  ratings, which are capped by Japan's Long-Term Local-Currency IDR of 'A'.  Therefore, a two notch upgrade of Sumitomo's IFS rating would be needed to  upgrade Symetra's holding company ratings. Conversely, if Sumitomo's ratings  were downgraded by more than one notch, based on its own credit quality, or  deterioration in Japan's sovereign rating, Symetra's holding company ratings  will also likely be lowered in conjunction with its parent.  FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings with a Stable Outlook: Symetra Financial Corp.  --IDR at 'A-'; --4.25% senior unsecured notes due July 15, 2024 at 'BBB+'; --8.3% junior subordinated CENts due Oct. 15, 2067 at 'BBB-'.

661,"   By Venus Wu | HONG KONG  HONG KONG Walt Disney (DIS.N) will expand its loss-making Hong Kong Disneyland theme park with a $1.4 billion investment to try to attract more visitors, the U.S. entertainment company and its local government partner said on Tuesday.Hong Kong Disneyland, the firm's smallest park, has been hit by weak local retail and tourism markets and suffered its first loss in four years in 2015. It cut an unspecified number of jobs  earlier this year.The Hong Kong resort also faces competition from other theme park operators fighting for mainland Chinese visitors, including Dalian Wanda, which plans to spend billions of dollars to launch at least 20 tourism parks in China.The Hong Kong government, which owns a 53 percent stake in the theme park, will chip in $750 million, while Disney will pay approximately $650 million for the expansion running from 2018 to 2023. The Hong Kong resort will add Frozen and Marvel themed areas -- attractions that it hopes can help differentiate it from other parks around the world, including a Shanghai Disneyland opened in June this year.Disney said this month that attendance had declined at its parks in Hong Kong, Paris and California during the most recent quarter, while four million people visited Shanghai Disneyland in its first four months.Hong Kong's retail and tourism industries have been ailing. The city saw a 6.1 percent decrease in the number of tourists in the first nine months this year, including a bigger drop from mainland China, according to official tourist board data. ""Everybody knows tourism in the region, especially in Hong Kong, has been challenging, so it's not just Hong Kong Disneyland,"" Samuel Lau, managing director of Hong Kong Disneyland said at a press conference announcing the plan.""We need to quickly double up to make sure we invest in tourism in the long run. Some of these projects will take time to build and create, and now is the time."" Disney said the expansion will create 3,500 jobs andeventually bring another 600 jobs within the park.Hong Kong Disneyland employed more than 5,300 full time and 2,500 part time staff, making it one of Hong Kong's largest employers, according to its Annual Business Review for fiscal year 2015.

664,"   By Tim Baysinger  The Walt Disney Company’s U.S. television arm will create shows for Snap Inc’s Snapchat, Disney announced on Wednesday, in Snapchat's latest deal with a major U.S. media company.Financial terms were not disclosed. Snap, which is preparing for next year's initial public offering, has signed a variety of advertising and content agreements this year with Viacom, Comcast’s NBCUniversal and Time Warner Inc’s Turner Broadcasting System Inc. Media companies such as Disney partner with Snapchat in an effort to reach the type of younger viewers the social media company targets, which increasingly eschew traditional television. The two had previously worked together for a special Live Stories, a Snapchat feature that curates user-submitted photos and videos tied to a specific event, around ABC’s broadcast of the Academy Awards in February.Unlike in Snapchat's other deals with media companies, where any ad sales responsibilities would be shared across both companies, Disney will control and sell all advertising for the shows it produces for Snapchat. The agreement with the Disney-ABC Television Group, which includes the ABC broadcast network and cable channel Freeform, begins in January with a series around ABC’s popular “The Bachelor” franchise. The recap series, “Watch Party: The Bachelor” will debut Jan. 3, a day after the ABC show begins its 21st season. Future shows based on other Disney-ABC properties will roll out on Snapchat later. “Earlier this year, we worked closely with Snap on a very successful The Oscars Live Story and we look forward to building on that relationship and providing Snapchat’s mobile-centric users with a unique, immersive experience around our shows and brands,” Disney-ABC Television executive John Frelinghuysen said in a statement.
