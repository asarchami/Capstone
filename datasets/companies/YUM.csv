0,"   By Adam Jourdan | SHANGHAI  SHANGHAI Jan 2 Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the world's largest retailer, has recalled donkey meat sold at some outlets in China after tests showed the product contained the DNA of other animals, the U.S. company said.Wal-Mart will reimburse customers who bought the tainted ""Five Spice"" donkey meat and is helping local food and industry agencies in eastern Shandong province investigate its Chinese supplier, it said late on Wednesday in official posts on China's Twitter-like Weibo. The Shandong Food and Drug Administration earlier said the product contained fox meat.The scandal could dent Wal-Mart's reputation for quality in China's $1 trillion food and grocery market where it plans to open 110 new stores in the next few years. China is the largest grocery market in the world and is set to grow to $1.5 trillion by 2016, according to the Institute of Grocery Distribution.""This is another hit on Wal-Mart's brand, meaning wealthy shoppers will start to lose the trust they had before,"" said Shaun Rein, Shanghai-based managing director of China Market Research (CMR) Group. CMR estimates Wal-Mart's market share fell from 7.5 percent to 5.2 percent over the last three years.Donkey meat is a popular snack in some areas of China, although it only accounts for a tiny fraction of overall meat consumption. In 2011 China slaughtered 2.4 million donkeys, according to country's livestock industry yearbook. TRACK RECORD Wal-Mart, French grocer Carrefour SA, McDonald's Corp and KFC-parent Yum Brands Inc among others, have come under fire before in China over food safety issues, a sensitive topic in a country riddled with scares from a fatal tainted milk scandal to recycled ""gutter oil"" used for cooking.Wal-Mart said it had set up an investigation team to look into the incident, would strengthen food safety rules and take legal action against the product supplier. It added the person in charge at the supplier factory had already been detained. ""We are deeply sorry for this whole affair,"" said Wal-Mart's China president and CEO, Greg Foran. ""It is a deep lesson (for us) that we need to continue to increase investment in supplier management.""The U.S. retailer has had a troubled past in China. In 2011, China fined Wal-Mart, along with Carrefour, a combined 9.5 million yuan ($1.57 million) for manipulating product prices. Wal-Mart was also fined that year in China for selling duck meat past its expiry date.Food safety scandals can have a significant impact in China. Yum has struggled to recover sales in China more than a year after a chicken supplier to KFC in the country was found to have used excess levels of antibiotics. Analysts, though, said the impact of the current scare would be far more subdued. Wal-Mart, which operates more than 400 facilities in China, competes with market leaders Sun Art Retail Group Ltd  and China Resources Enterprise Ltd, which in August teamed up with British retailer Tesco Plc.Consumers on popular microblogging site Sina Weibo were at a loss whether to criticise Wal-Mart or support it. Online sentiment can spread quickly in China where there is a high proportion of social media users.""Isn't fox meat more expensive than donkey meat anyway?"" asked one bemused user.",2014-01-02,YUM,"Wed Jan 1, 2014 | 11:59pm EST",Wal-Mart recalls donkey product in China after fox meat scandal,http://www.reuters.com//article/walmart-china-idUSL3N0KC0LH20140102?type=companyNews

10,"  By Ross KerberBOSTON, March 17 Big U.S. companies appear to have handed out smaller increases in compensation to their chief executives in 2013 than in 2012, mainly as a result of reduced grants of stock options, according to an early review of annual regulatory filings.Based on disclosures from 46 companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index that had filed annual compensation reports by March 11, the median compensation increase for a CEO was 1 percent to $8.64 million.That was a slower rate of increase than this group of 46 received for 2012 when its median CEO pay rose 15 percent to $8.53 million. The median compensation for CEOs in S&P 500 companies overall increased about 5.5 percent for 2012.The review, conducted for Reuters by proxy adviser and corporate governance consulting firm Institutional Shareholder Services, provides an early peek at compensation trends but ISS cautioned that there could be significant changes once all companies have reported and that the 46 companies may not be  representative of trends for companies in the entire index. Most companies will file their executive compensation data over the next few weeks.Some pay experts have been expecting to see slower growth in compensation for 2013 - despite the bull market in stocks - as S&P 500 corporate profits only increased 6.2 percent amid a stuttering U.S. economic performance, and due to the increasing use of performance measures to decide on levels of compensation.In the kinds of incentive plans becoming more popular, executives do not receive higher compensation just because a company's share price rises, but rather must perform well on a series of measures - not just profit, but often including revenue, margins, cash flow, and in some cases even a company's safety and environment records.""They're not going to get monster rewards,"" said Alan Johnson, managing director of pay consulting firm Johnson Associates in New York. ""The indications are that companies continue to do a better job of matching up pay with performance.""However, the figures are unlikely to assuage concerns that CEOs are reaping bigger increases than those received by many Americans further down the food chain, exacerbating inequality. President Barack Obama has been stressing policies intended to reduce inequality, such as a push for a higher minimum wage.The study looks at what was granted to CEOs for 2013 and does not include all the compensation CEOs actually pocketed in 2013 after stock and option awards granted to them in previous years were exercised or vested. With the S&P 500 surging 32.4 percent last year, including dividends, and almost tripling from the lows it hit in the financial crisis, some of those awards from 2009-2012 have proven very lucrative. A separate review by executive compensation data firm Equilar of 44 companies in the Fortune 1,000 that filed their statements in January or February shows that the median value executives gained from exercising stock options or stock vesting was $2.1 million in 2013, up 18 percent from 2012.RADICAL CHANGES Investor activists and proxy advisers, including ISS, have pressed companies for years to align pay with shareholder interests. In recent weeks, a handful of companies have made radical changes in the way they reward their CEOs, including semiconductor maker Intel Corp and mining group Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.Among the 46 S&P 500 companies surveyed, the median cash salary rose $27,584, or 2.6 percent, to $1,079,327. But the median stock award rose $337,493, or 9.5 percent, to $3,887,008, and the median cash incentive award rose $63,799, or 3.3 percent, to $1,998,102.Restraining the overall increase, though, were less generous stock options awards. Of the 46 companies, only 32 of them awarded stock options to their CEOs in 2013, down from 35 in 2012. For those 35 companies (including those who did not grant options in 2013), the average award fell by $548,543, or 23 percent, to $1,880,476 in 2013.Some companies said they reduced their option awards as they wanted to reduce the incentive to take certain risks. At financial services company Comerica Inc, total compensation for CEO Ralph Babb fell 10 percent to $6.46 million, as the value of his option awards fell to $314,729 from $1,047,682 in 2012. Comerica said in a filing it cut the weighting of stock option awards during the year to ""discourage inappropriate risk taking and better align with regulatory expectations."" At paint maker Sherwin-Williams, total compensation for CEO Christopher Connor fell 1.5 percent to $10.8 million, as the value of stock option awards fell to $3 million from $3.3 million in 2012. The company said in a filing that it has de-emphasized stock options in favor of stock awards related to performance to provide more focus on operating performance.""Most CEOs get it, an increase in stock price is going to be their greatest opportunity for compensation,"" said David Dorman, an investor and board member at a series of companies, including  network technology company Motorola Solutions Inc, pharmacy group CVS Caremark Corp and KFC and Pizza Hut owner Yum! Brands Inc.He said that generally compensation for executives in corporate America ""will be in a pretty tight range.""A few caveats apply to the ISS figures. They do not include set-asides for executive pensions and other deferred obligations, which are often established by formula.

11,"   By Ross Kerber | BOSTON, March 17  BOSTON, March 17 Big U.S. companies appear to have handed out smaller increases in compensation to their chief executives in 2013 than in 2012, mainly as a result of reduced grants of stock options, according to an early review of annual regulatory filings.Based on disclosures from 46 companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index that had filed annual compensation reports by March 11, the median compensation increase for a CEO was 1 percent to $8.64 million.That was a slower rate of increase than this group of 46 received for 2012 when its median CEO pay rose 15 percent to $8.53 million. The median compensation for CEOs in S&P 500 companies overall increased about 5.5 percent for 2012.The review, conducted for Reuters by proxy adviser and corporate governance consulting firm Institutional Shareholder Services, provides an early peek at compensation trends but ISS cautioned that there could be significant changes once all companies have reported and that the 46 companies may not be  representative of trends for companies in the entire index. Most companies will file their executive compensation data over the next few weeks.Some pay experts have been expecting to see slower growth in compensation for 2013 - despite the bull market in stocks - as S&P 500 corporate profits only increased 6.2 percent amid a stuttering U.S. economic performance, and due to the increasing use of performance measures to decide on levels of compensation.In the kinds of incentive plans becoming more popular, executives do not receive higher compensation just because a company's share price rises, but rather must perform well on a series of measures - not just profit, but often including revenue, margins, cash flow, and in some cases even a company's safety and environment records.""They're not going to get monster rewards,"" said Alan Johnson, managing director of pay consulting firm Johnson Associates in New York. ""The indications are that companies continue to do a better job of matching up pay with performance.""However, the figures are unlikely to assuage concerns that CEOs are reaping bigger increases than those received by many Americans further down the food chain, exacerbating inequality. President Barack Obama has been stressing policies intended to reduce inequality, such as a push for a higher minimum wage.The study looks at what was granted to CEOs for 2013 and does not include all the compensation CEOs actually pocketed in 2013 after stock and option awards granted to them in previous years were exercised or vested. With the S&P 500 surging 32.4 percent last year, including dividends, and almost tripling from the lows it hit in the financial crisis, some of those awards from 2009-2012 have proven very lucrative.A separate review by executive compensation data firm Equilar of 44 companies in the Fortune 1,000 that filed their statements in January or February shows that the median value executives gained from exercising stock options or stock vesting was $2.1 million in 2013, up 18 percent from 2012. RADICAL CHANGES Investor activists and proxy advisers, including ISS, have pressed companies for years to align pay with shareholder interests. In recent weeks, a handful of companies have made radical changes in the way they reward their CEOs, including semiconductor maker Intel Corp and mining group Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.Among the 46 S&P 500 companies surveyed, the median cash salary rose $27,584, or 2.6 percent, to $1,079,327. But the median stock award rose $337,493, or 9.5 percent, to $3,887,008, and the median cash incentive award rose $63,799, or 3.3 percent, to $1,998,102.Restraining the overall increase, though, were less generous stock options awards. Of the 46 companies, only 32 of them awarded stock options to their CEOs in 2013, down from 35 in 2012. For those 35 companies (including those who did not grant options in 2013), the average award fell by $548,543, or 23 percent, to $1,880,476 in 2013.Some companies said they reduced their option awards as they wanted to reduce the incentive to take certain risks. At financial services company Comerica Inc, total compensation for CEO Ralph Babb fell 10 percent to $6.46 million, as the value of his option awards fell to $314,729 from $1,047,682 in 2012. Comerica said in a filing it cut the weighting of stock option awards during the year to ""discourage inappropriate risk taking and better align with regulatory expectations.""At paint maker Sherwin-Williams, total compensation for CEO Christopher Connor fell 1.5 percent to $10.8 million, as the value of stock option awards fell to $3 million from $3.3 million in 2012. The company said in a filing that it has de-emphasized stock options in favor of stock awards related to performance to provide more focus on operating performance. ""Most CEOs get it, an increase in stock price is going to be their greatest opportunity for compensation,"" said David Dorman, an investor and board member at a series of companies, including  network technology company Motorola Solutions Inc, pharmacy group CVS Caremark Corp and KFC and Pizza Hut owner Yum! Brands Inc.He said that generally compensation for executives in corporate America ""will be in a pretty tight range.""A few caveats apply to the ISS figures. They do not include set-asides for executive pensions and other deferred obligations, which are often established by formula. At some companies these set-asides fell in 2013 as interest rates rose.John Roe, ISS's executive director of corporate services, said companies have embraced new forms of pay.

Yum gets more than half of its overall sales in China and plans to open 700 stores there this year.KFC, Yum's key brand in the China market, has been hard-hit since official media reported that chicken it purchased had been fed excess antibiotics in late 2012. Revenues dipped, with China sales at established restaurants falling 4 percent during the fourth quarter of last year. Sam Su, vice chairman of Yum Brands Inc, said in the statement the overhaul would involve new packaging, store designs and digital initiatives to help marketing and sales. Yum, the largest fast-food chain in China with over 6,200 stores, has seen its market share held flat over the past five years, with around 41.2 percent in 2012, according to data from research firm Euromonitor. U.S. rival McDonald's Corp had around 14.7 in the same year.

The sector also is struggling to remain relevant as more consumers move away from decadent food like cheeseburgers and french fries to fresher, healthier fare.     ""People want better food. Who loses?

The India division's same-restaurant sales fell 2 percent, versus the 1.6 percent gain that analysts expected.Yum is not alone. Jubilant Foodworks Ltd, which operates Domino's Pizza Inc restaurants in India, saw same-store sales growth slow sharply to 1.6 percent in the fiscal year that ended March 31 from 16.2 percent a year ago.Jubilant blamed the slowdown on the ""overall strenuous macro-economic situation"" and a drop in discretionary spending.The company has yet to report its June-quarter earnings, but analysts say growth in the fast food sector as a whole is unlikely to pick up before at least another nine months as India's newly elected government tries to kick start an economy that is battling the longest spell of below 5 percent growth in quarter of a century. ""Consumer sentiment has not shown any signs of improvement,"" said Saloni Nangia, president at retail consultancy Technopak.""The expectations were that post-elections it will improve but that hasn't happened,"" she added. Prime Minister Narendra Modi won May elections with a pledge to revive Asia's third-largest economy.Fast food in India is largely a middle-class luxury. Both Yum and Jubliant are rapidly expanding their store network, anticipating an increase in the number of more affluent Indians in the next few years. The fast food restaurant market is set to triple in 2018 from $1 billion last year, Technopak said.Yum has been in India for more than a decade. It had 714 total units in the country at the end of the second quarter, including KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurants. India is a competitive environment and Yum is ""investing aggressively"" in that market, spokesman Jonathan Blum told Reuters.Same-restaurant sales were up 2 percent for Taco Bell and down 3 percent for Pizza Hut. Analysts polled by Consensus Metrix expected a 3.6 percent gain for Taco Bell and a 0.1 percent rise for Pizza Hut.Chief Executive Officer David Novak said the company was pleased with initial results from Taco Bell's breakfast launch in the United States, adding that it was working to improve results at Pizza Hut.""We are taking significant actions in our U.S. (Pizza Hut) business to reignite sales and expect to make substantial progress"" for the rest of the year, Novak said in a statement.Louisville, Kentucky-based Yum also reported net income of $334 million, or 73 cents per share, for the second quarter that ended June 14, compared with $281 million, or 61 cents per share, a year earlier.The company, which will hold a conference call with financial analysts on Thursday morning, said it is on its way to hitting its forecast of full-year earnings-per-share growth of at least 20 percent.Yum's stock fell 2.3 percent to $80.81 in after-hours trading on Wednesday, but it remains near its 52-week high.

22,"   By Adam Jourdan and Lisa Baertlein | SHANGHAI/LOS ANGELES  SHANGHAI/LOS ANGELES Yum Brands Inc and McDonald's Corp are facing a new food safety scare in China, denting the fast-food companies' efforts to shore up reputations and businesses that were hurt by a 2012 safety scandal in one of their biggest markets. McDonald's and KFC parent Yum apologized to customers on Monday after Chinese regulators shut a local meat supplier following a TV report that showed workers picking up meat from a factory floor, as well as mixing meat beyond its expiration date with fresh meat. The companies said they immediately stopped using the supplier, Shanghai Husi Food Co Ltd, a unit of Aurora, Illinois-based OSI Group, and had switched to alternatives. They added that the factory served restaurants in the Shanghai area.The report on China's Dragon TV brought Yum and McDonald's  back into the firing line following the sales-battering 2012 scandal that involved chicken pumped with excessive amounts of antibiotics.""We will not tolerate any violations of government laws and regulations from our suppliers,"" said Yum China, which required all of its KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants to seal up and stop using all meat materials supplied by the Husi factory.  The division, Yum's No. 1 business unit, had just seen its KFC restaurants bounce back from the double whammy of the food safety scare and a bird flu outbreak.""If proven, the practices outlined in the reports are completely unacceptable to McDonald's anywhere in the world,"" a China-based spokeswoman for McDonald's told Reuters. Husi provided McDonald's with chicken, beef and lettuce, a McDonald's U.S. spokeswoman said.China is McDonald's third-biggest market as measured in number of restaurants. ""I think this is going to be really challenging for both these firms,"" said Benjamin Cavender, Shanghai-based principal at China Market Research Group.    ""I don't know that this is something an apology can fix so easily, because at this point people don't have a whole lot of trust that they have good systems in place,"" he added. Yum shares fell 4.2 percent to close at $74.13 and McDonald's shares lost 1.5 percent to $97.55.""Although the issue is being addressed, we would not rule out the possibility of temporary sales disruptions,"" Baird analyst David Tarantino said in a research note lowering his target price on the company.    The Shanghai Municipal Food and Drug Administration shut  Husi down on Sunday after the local Chinese TV broadcast aired. In addition to the meat safety violations, the program showed workers saying that if clients knew what they were doing, the firm would lose its contracts.OSI said on its Chinese website that management was ""appalled by the report."" The company said it has formed its own investigation team, is fully cooperating with government inspectors and will take all necessary actions based on results of the investigation.    ""Management believes this to be an isolated event, but takes full responsibility for the situation,"" OSI said. OSI, which has close to 60 manufacturing facilities worldwide and had revenue of more than $5 billion in 2012, has been supplying McDonald's in China since 1992 and KFC and Pizza Hut parent Yum since 2008, according to its website. SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES McDonald's and Yum are the top two brands by sales in China's $174 billion fast-food market, according to Euromonitor, but face a challenge as local firms try to tempt cost-conscious diners with healthy, home-grown fare.    Both companies said they are investigating the issues highlighted in the report and said that switching suppliers will cause some temporary product shortages.News of the scare spread quickly to diners negotiating Shanghai's lunch-hour rush on Monday. ""For now I won't go to eat at McDonald's or KFC, at least until this whole thing settles down,"" said Xu Xinyu, 24, a financial services worker, eating at a noodle shop near a McDonald's outlet in downtown Shanghai. Yet Chinese consumers may already have developed a comparatively thick skin when it comes to food scandals. ""Isn't everywhere like this?"" asked student Li Xiaoye, 20, eating a beef burger in a Shanghai McDonald's outlet. ""I'll keep going because wherever I eat, the issues are all the same.""      The incident highlights the difficulty in ensuring quality and safety along the supply chain in China. Wal-Mart Stores Inc came under the spotlight this year after a supplier's donkey meat product was found to contain fox meat. It also came under fire for selling expired duck meat in 2011.OSI is one of McDonald's key meat suppliers and has a good reputation, according to an industry insider speaking on condition of anonymity. He added the incident highlights the issue firms face enforcing strict processes with local staff.As well as Yum and McDonald's, OSI listed Starbucks Corp, Japan's Saizeriya Co Ltd, Papa John's International Inc, Burger King Worldwide Inc and Doctor's Associates Inc's Subway brand as clients in China, according to a 2012 press release.Burger King shares fell 1.6 percent to close at $26.13.A Starbucks spokesman told Reuters that the company does not now have any direct business dealings with Husi Food.Burger King, Subway, Papa John's and Saizeriya did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

29,"  SHANGHAI, July 21 U.S. fast food chains McDonald's Corp and Yum! Brands Inc said they will stop using products supplied by a local meat processor after a Shanghai regulator halted the firm's operations on Sunday over food safety concerns.The move is a potential concern for the two brands, which are both now conducting their own investigation into the matter, since the pair were hit hard by a food safety scandal in China late in 2012. Yum, which apologised to Chinese consumers for any inconvenience caused in the latest case, suffered a sharp dive in profits early in 2013 after the safety concerns.The Shanghai Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) halted the operations of Shanghai Husi Food Co., Ltd, a meat supplier suspected of providing meat that had passed its expiration date to China branches of McDonald's restaurants and Yum's KFC and Pizza Hut outlets, the Xinhua news agency reported on Sunday. The SFDA inspected Shanghai Husi on Sunday evening after a local television channel broadcast a programme claiming an undercover reporter had seen the use of expired meat and poor hygiene practices in a local factory, local media said. Yum and McDonald's both said they have stopped using meat products purchased from Shanghai Husi, according to statements posted on their official Weibo microblog sites.

30,"   By Adam Jourdan | SHANGHAI  SHANGHAI The latest food scandal in China is spreading fast, dragging in U.S. coffee chain Starbucks, Burger King Worldwide Inc and others, as well as McDonald's products as far away as Japan.McDonald's Corp and KFC's parent Yum Brands Inc apologized to Chinese customers on Monday after it emerged that Shanghai Husi Food Co Ltd, a unit of U.S.-based OSI Group LLC, had supplied expired meat to the two chains.On Tuesday, Starbucks said some of its cafes previously sold products containing chicken originally sourced from Shanghai Husi, a firm that was shut down on Sunday by local regulators after a TV report showed staff using expired meat and picking up meat from the floor to add to the mix.A Tokyo-based spokesman at McDonald's Holdings Co (Japan) Ltd said the company had sourced about a fifth of its Chicken McNuggets from Shanghai Husi and had halted sales of the product on Monday. Alternative supplies of chicken have been found in Thailand and China, he added. The company's shares briefly fell as much as 1.4 percent to a 15-month low before closing down 0.4 percent.China's food watchdog said it ordered regional offices to carry out spot checks on all firms which had used Shanghai Husi products, and would inspect all of parent OSI's sites around China to see if enough has been done to ensure food safety. It said the case could be handed over to the police.The regulator's Shanghai branch said in a statement on Tuesday it had demanded production, quality control and sales records from OSI. It added it already ordered McDonald's to seal over 4,500 boxes of suspected meat products and Yum's Pizza Hut to seal over 500 boxes of beef.Fast-food chain Burger King and Dicos, China's third-ranked fast food chain owned by Ting Hsin International, said they would remove Shanghai Husi food products from their outlets. Pizza chain Papa John's International Inc said on its Weibo blog that it had taken down all meat products supplied by Shanghai Husi and cut ties with the supplier. FOOD SAFETY CONCERNS Food safety is one of the top issues for Chinese consumers after a scandal in 2008 where dairy products tainted with the industrial chemical melamine led to the deaths of six infants and made many thousands sick. Other food scandals have hit the meat and dairy industries in recent years, and many Chinese look to foreign brands as offering higher safety standards.  China is McDonald's third-biggest market by number of restaurants and Yum's top market by revenue. McDonald's is due to report quarterly earnings later on Tuesday.The scare has stirred local consumers and become one of the most discussed topics online among the country's influential 'netizens', with some users spreading long lists of firms thought to be tarnished.The incident highlights the difficulty in ensuring quality and safety along the supply chain in China. Wal-Mart Stores Inc came under the spotlight early this year after a supplier's donkey meat product was found to contain fox meat. It also came under fire for selling expired duck meat in 2011.Starbucks said on its Chinese microblog site that it had no direct business relationship with Shanghai Husi, but that some of its chicken acquired from another supplier had originally come from Husi for its ""Chicken Apple Sauce Panini"" products. This had been sold in 13 different provinces and major cities. The company added that all the products had already been removed from its shelves. Burger King said in a Weibo statement posted late on Monday that it had taken off its shelves all meat products supplied by Shanghai Husi Food and had launched an investigation.Dicos said it pulled all ham products supplied by Shanghai Husi, and would stop serving its ham sandwich product for breakfast. ""We will continue to carry out a probe into Shanghai Husi Food and its related firms, to understand whether or not it followed national regulations,"" Dicos said in a statement.Swedish furniture firm IKEA [IKEA.UL], which has in-store food outlets, said on Weibo that Shanghai Husi had previously been a supplier, but had not provided the firm with products since September last year. Domino's Pizza Inc and Doctor's Associates Inc's Subway brand, which were named in online reports as being supplied meat from Shanghai Husi, said their outlets in China did not use meat products from the firm.Yoshinoya-parent Hop Hing Group Holdings Ltd, Japanese convenience store FamilyMart Co Ltd and Chinese chain Wallace urged diners not to worry, and said they did not currently use any products from Shanghai Husi.

DIFFERENT STANDARDS A Chinese TV report on Sunday set off a storm of controversy after it showed staff at the Shanghai Husi facility using meat that had expired and had been lying on the floor.Huang Denggang, 20, worked as a night cleaner at that Husi plant, a modern warehouse compound in a Shanghai suburb, for more than a year, but does not plan to return when it reopens because of lower-than-expected pay and a medical claim. He told Reuters on Wednesday that he had seen workers pick up raw meat from the floor and put it back into processing containers. ""The leader didn't say anything when you throw it back,"" he said at a local job agency where he works during the day.

""If you wear gloves,"" he said, ""maybe it slows you down if you want to pick up the chicken pieces because they’re slippery."" He added, however, that he did not work in that part of the factory.Another Husi worker, who gave only the surname Zhang, said by telephone that he had worked on the production line, breaking up chicken into pieces, but had quit because of the low pay. ""When (raw meat) drops, they usually don't see it, and even if they do, it was fine to pick it up and put it back,"" he said. ""There was an attitude of 'it doesn't really matter.'""The former employees' comments contrasted with what one worker at another of OSI's food-processing plants in Langfang in the northern Chinese province of Hebei told Reuters.

He said the Hebei factory, which according to its website processes meat, vegetables and flour products, was still open for business despite government inspections.DOCTORED RECORDS     Xinhua also cited Gu Zhenhua, deputy head of the Shanghai Municipal Food and Drug Administration, as saying that Shanghai Husi's controls systems and records for suspected products violated Chinese regulations.    In the Dragon TV documentary on Sunday, staff at the Shanghai Husi facility said they kept two record books on food products, one of which was doctored to be shown to anyone who came to audit the facility. According to the report, which claimed to show an inspection of the facility by McDonald's, Shanghai Husi staff learned of the visit a day in advance and made sure that only compliant products were being processed on the day.The Shanghai food watchdog also said it had sealed more than 1,000 tonnes of suspected meat products from OSI in China and another 100 tonnes of products from various customers.

40,"   By Lisa Baertlein  A food safety scare in China is testing local consumers' loyalty to foreign fast-food brands, including McDonald's Corp and Yum Brands Inc, which owns the KFC and Pizza Hut chains.Yum said on Wednesday that the scare, triggered by a TV report earlier this month showing improper meat handling by a supplier, Shanghai Husi Food, caused ""significant, negative"" damage to sales at KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants over the past 10 days. ""If the significant sales impact is sustained, it will have a material effect on full-year earnings per share,"" Yum said in a regulatory filing. Shares in Yum, which counts China as its No. 1 market, tumbled nearly 7 percent on Thursday. At least three brokerages cut their profit estimates for Yum for 2014 and 2015.RBC analysts said Yum's China sales could be hurt 10-15 percent for 6-8 weeks, and cut their price target to $85 from $94.  UBS analysts said the initial consumer response was worse than feared, and the company should reinstate reporting monthly figures to reduce uncertainty.    Officials from McDonald's in China and Hong Kong have not responded to requests for information on the impact on sales from the scandal, but McDonald's Holdings Co (Japan) Ltd on Tuesday scrapped its full-year earnings guidance after the China scare forced it to switch to alternative chicken supplies. A McDonald's Japan executive said sales had dropped 15-20 percent on a daily basis due to the scare. Both McDonald's and Yum are looking to China - where consumers see foreign brands as offering better food quality - for long-term growth given the size of its population, growing middle class and rapid economic growth.    ""Both of these stocks are banking heavily on China for their future growth,"" said Richard Brubaker, an adjunct professor at the China Europe International Business School and founder of the Collective Responsibility consultancy. ""For Yum, this is a problem because it has a history of problems in China. For McDonald's, it's the sheer size of the problem and the inability to get product."" CONSUMER CAUTION    Yum, which has nearly 6,400 restaurants in China, had just begun to see its restaurant sales there recovering from a slide last year due to an avian food outbreak and a previous food safety scare. Yum has cut its global ties with OSI Group LLC [OSIGP.UL], the U.S. parent of Shanghai Husi Food. Yum said OSI was not a major supplier and the move had ""minimal disruption"" to the availability of menu offerings in China.    McDonald's, which has more than 2,000 restaurants in China, has had a long relationship with OSI and was more dependent on the supplier than Yum. Many McDonald's China outlets have been hit by meat shortages since the company ended its relationship with OSI there.    Around two-thirds of the more than five dozen consumers Reuters reporters spoke to in Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong on Thursday said they would scale back their visits to McDonald's, at least for now.    ""For people like us, McDonald's and KFC are places to meet friends,"" said Yao Nanfang, a 16-year-old student in a shopping mall in central Shanghai. ""We'll still go to McDonald's, but we'll order fewer meat products.""    Diners in Hong Kong also said they were likely to eat less frequently at McDonald's, but noted that the chain's low prices made it hard to give up.

But still attracted by low prices, a place to meet friendsBy Lisa BaertleinJuly 31 A food safety scare in China is testing local consumers' loyalty to foreign fast-food brands, including McDonald's Corp and Yum Brands Inc, which owns the KFC and Pizza Hut chains.Yum said on Wednesday that the scare, triggered by a TV report earlier this month showing improper meat handling by a supplier, Shanghai Husi Food, caused ""significant, negative"" damage to sales at KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants over the past 10 days. ""If the significant sales impact is sustained, it will have a material effect on full-year earnings per share,"" Yum said in a regulatory filing.Shares in Yum, which counts China as its No. 1 market, tumbled nearly 7 percent on Thursday.At least three brokerages cut their profit estimates for Yum for 2014 and 2015. RBC analysts said Yum's China sales could be hurt 10-15 percent for 6-8 weeks, and cut their price target to $85 from $94. UBS analysts said the initial consumer response was worse than feared, and the company should reinstate reporting monthly figures to reduce uncertainty.Officials from McDonald's in China and Hong Kong have not responded to requests for information on the impact on sales from the scandal, but McDonald's Holdings Co (Japan) Ltd  on Tuesday scrapped its full-year earnings guidance after the China scare forced it to switch to alternative chicken supplies. A McDonald's Japan executive said sales had dropped  15-20 percent on a daily basis due to the scare.Both McDonald's and Yum are looking to China - where consumers see foreign brands as offering better food quality - for long-term growth given the size of its population, growing middle class and rapid economic growth.""Both of these stocks are banking heavily on China for their future growth,"" said Richard Brubaker, an adjunct professor at the China Europe International Business School and founder of the Collective Responsibility consultancy. ""For Yum, this is a problem because it has a history of problems in China. For McDonald's, it's the sheer size of the problem and the inability to get product."" CONSUMER CAUTION Yum, which has nearly 6,400 restaurants in China, had just begun to see its restaurant sales there recovering from a slide last year due to an avian food outbreak and a previous food safety scare. Yum has cut its global ties with OSI Group LLC , the U.S. parent of Shanghai Husi Food. Yum said OSI was not a major supplier and the move had ""minimal disruption"" to the availability of menu offerings in China.McDonald's, which has more than 2,000 restaurants in China, has had a long relationship with OSI and was more dependent on the supplier than Yum. Many McDonald's China outlets have been hit by meat shortages since the company ended its relationship with OSI there. Around two-thirds of the more than five dozen consumers Reuters reporters spoke to in Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong on Thursday said they would scale back their visits to McDonald's, at least for now.""For people like us, McDonald's and KFC are places to meet friends,"" said Yao Nanfang, a 16-year-old student in a shopping mall in central Shanghai. ""We'll still go to McDonald's, but we'll order fewer meat products.""Diners in Hong Kong also said they were likely to eat less frequently at McDonald's, but noted that the chain's low prices made it hard to give up.""I come to McDonald's less often now, but I won't completely stop coming because it's so much cheaper than other restaurants,"" said Nan Tang, who says he eats at McDonald's twice a week.In Hong Kong, McDonald's has ended a promotion of its chicken McSpicy burger and shifted a membership program away from offering discounts on McNuggets, which it is not currently selling.Following the TV report that alleged workers at Shanghai Husi Food used expired meat and doctored food production dates, regulators closed the plant on July 20.

44,"  (Adds Japan results, details on Yum warning)Aug 4 McDonald's Corp said its business has been hurt by China's latest food scare that forced restaurants in the region to temporarily pull meat items from menus.An undercover local Chinese TV report on July 20 showed  workers at Shanghai Husi Food Co Ltd using expired meat and doctoring food production dates. Regulators immediately closed the factory, which is part of OSI Group LLC, a U.S. food supplier and important McDonald's partner.""While this matter will negatively impact results in the near term, we cannot reasonably estimate the impact on full year 2014 earnings at this time,"" according to a regulatory filing from McDonald's, which has just over 2,000 restaurants in China.McDonald's warning on Monday came just days after rival Yum Brands Inc, which has about 6,400 restaurants in China and whose KFC is the biggest Western brand in the country, also said the scandal was driving China customers away.McDonald's shares dropped 0.5 percent to $93.86 at mid-afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of McDonald's and Yum have fallen 5.2 percent and 8.6 percent, respectively, since the scandal broke on July 20.McDonald's Holdings Co (Japan) Ltd on July 29 withdrew its full-year earnings forecast after the China meat scare caused sales to drop 15 to 20 percent on a daily basis.The company, which has more than 3,100 restaurants in Japan, previously had forecast an operating profit of 11.7 billion yen ($115 million) for 2014. McDonald's affected markets account for about 10 percent of its total revenue, the world's largest burger chain said in its filing on Monday.About 15 percent of operating profit at McDonald's comes from its Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa unit that includes China and Japan, analysts said.The warning from McDonald's prompted Janney Capital Markets analyst Mark Kalinowski to cut his earnings per share estimates for the fast-food chain by 3 cents to $1.55 for the third quarter, and by 1 cent to $1.43 for the fourth quarter. Yum on July 30 warned that the scandal had hurt sales badly at its KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants over the previous 10 days.Yum got 35 percent of its operating profit from China last year and is more exposed to the market than McDonald's.Yum did not quantify the impact of the China scandal on its profits, but said that a sustained, significant sales impact would ""have a material effect on full-year earnings per share.""The double whammy of a food safety scare and bird flu in China battered sales at McDonald's and Yum last year.

""While there have been no reported illnesses linked to any Shanghai Husi products, recovering this production is an important step in facilitating the investigations and rebuilding the respect and trust of our customers, the government and the people of China,"" OSI said in a statement late on Thursday.OSI didn't say how much of Shanghai Husi Food Co's production would be withdrawn, nor from which outlets. OSI was not immediately available for comment beyond its published statement, and the Shanghai Food and Drug Administration regulator did not respond to requests for comment.

McDonald's China and Hong Kong are no longer sourcing any products from OSI companies in China, and McDonald's in Japan has moved its sourcing to Thailand. The scare, which has also involved restaurants in Hong Kong, Macau and Japan, is a sensitive issue for China, which has struggled to restore confidence in its $1 trillion food processing industry since six infants died in 2008 after drinking adulterated milk.

47,"  (Adds supplier details, analyst comment)SHANGHAI Aug 11 Five fast food chains including McDonald's and Yum Brands Inc have published details of their suppliers on their Chinese websites following a request from Shanghai authorities after a food safety scare.Shanghai's Municipal Food and Drug Administration said on Saturday it had asked the two chains, along with Burger King , Dicos and Carl's Jr, to publish the usually confidential information as part of efforts government efforts to strengthen oversight of food suppliers.The five firms were among a range of companies that used meat from Shanghai Husi Food, a unit of U.S.-based OSI Group LLC, which was alleged by a TV report to have improperly handled meat and used expired food. The Shanghai authority said the companies published the information on Aug. 9. Yum's suppliers include subsidiaries of WH Group's  and China Yurun Food while McDonald's milk suppliers include Beijing Sanyuan Foods Co Ltd and Kowloon Dairy. A Shandong meat unit in which China's state-backed COFCO Corp owns shares supplies both Yum and Burger King, the lists showed. Benjamin Cavender, Shanghai-based analyst at China Market Research Group, said food chains are generally reluctant to publish supplier lists as they don't want competitors to know where they source their materials.""In this case it's probably smart for the companies to do this because they want to send a clear message that they are being transparent both to the government and to their consumers,"" he said.

The latest in a series of food safety scares that have decimated sales at Western chains such as KFC and McDonald's Corp broke in July when a local Chinese television station showed workers at supplier Shanghai Husi using meat past its expiration date.Yum, which is the largest Western restaurant operator in China with nearly 6,420 restaurants, conducted only a small percentage of its business with Shanghai Husi and quickly cut ties with its parent, major U.S. meat supplier OSI Group LLC.But news stories about the scandal often mentioned Yum's KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants with equal weight to McDonald's, which is a major OSI customer, and the damage was done, Novak said. On Tuesday, Yum slashed its 2014 earnings growth forecast, citing the hit from the supplier scandal.The latest incident landed just as Yum's China restaurant sales had begun to recover from the double whammy of an avian flu outbreak and a December 2012 poultry supply scare at KFC that caused Yum to cut 1,000 poultry farmers from its China supply chain. No diner is believed to have fallen ill as a result of any of the food safety scares that caused sales to swoon.In response to the Shanghai Husi incident, Yum is requiring suppliers in China to install closed-circuit televisions. It also is establishing a whistleblower system to encourage suppliers and employees to report any potential food safety violations, Novak said.""I would never be one to say that we could never have an incident like this again, but I can tell you ... we do everything we can to learn from it and get better,"" said Novak, who is retiring as Yum's CEO on Jan. 1.Shares of Yum were up 1.4 percent at $70.70 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

""With 50 million people and a growing middle class with disposable income, the country offers significant consumer opportunity for Yoma Strategic to grow KFC over the long term,"" Yoma said in a statement.

63,"  SHANGHAI Nov 10 A criminal gang in eastern China has sold almost 100 tonnes of toxic tofu onto the local market, the latest in a string of scares that have thrown light on shady practices in the country's food industry.The gang added industrial bleaching agent rongalite to make dried tofu sticks brighter and chewier, the Shanghai Daily reported on Monday, citing official media in Shandong province. Rongalite is banned in food production as it can lead to cancer.Gut-wrenching food scares erupt regularly in China and highlight the challenges firms face to control supply chains.A supplier to KFC parent Yum Brands Inc and McDonald's Corp came under fire in July after a report showed workers using expired meat. U.S. retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc recalled some donkey meat products in January after tests showed they contained traces of fox. Media reports made no mention if the tofu factory had supplied any large local or global chains operating in China.The local Qilu Evening News newspaper said the gang, led by three cousins, had bags of rongalite powder stacked against the walls of the factory. The chemical was then added into the mix to make the dried tofu sticks, also called ""fuzhu"", a popular snack in China. ""The factory floor was filthy and there was a choking odour in the premises. Workers were busy making fuzhu with utensils that were covered in dirt,"" police official Zhang Qinchao told the local paper.Police detained four men involved in the operation and seized nearly 10 tonnes of toxic tofu, but said a further 100 tonnes had already been sold by the gang within Shandong and nearby Henan and Jiangxi provinces.No one has yet been reported ill from eating the affected products, the report said.

64,"   By Letitia Stein | TAMPA, Fla.  TAMPA, Fla. Nov 14 A new ""Fair Food"" label to help shoppers identify tomatoes grown under ethical working conditions is expected to debut as soon as this weekend at Whole Foods Market, a result of efforts to ensure Florida farmworkers' rights to water, shade and fair wages.The label, featuring a worker hoisting a brimming bucket, publicizes a campaign to reform an industry criticized by labor groups and prosecutors for unsafe and unfair working conditions.A dozen major buyers, including Wal-Mart, Yum Brands , and Subway restaurants, are participating. It is not yet known when the label may be available at all outlets.Participating buyers have agreed to purchase fresh tomatoes only from growers following higher standards. About 90 percent of tomato growers have signed on in Florida, the nation's leading producer of fresh market tomatoes. The campaign's centerpiece is a premium of an extra penny per pound picked, paid on top of workers' hourly minimum wages. Since 2011, this has netted an extra $15 million for workers, organizers said, adding $30 to $80 or more to weekly paychecks.The label is ""potentially game-changing like few things are,"" said Janice Fine, an associate professor in labor studies and employment relations at Rutgers University in New Jersey. Officials at the White House and the United Nations have called the program a model that could expand to other regions and crops. The campaign is profiled in the film ""Food Chains,"" set for national release later this month.In Florida, the program has assured safe conditions for an estimated 60,000 to 90,000 workers during tomato season, mostly in the central and southern parts of the state. Florida fields produced $456 million in fresh market tomatoes in 2013, according to the state and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It's a market that Florida dominates, along with California, the nation's top overall tomato producer.Whole Foods will debut ""Fair Food"" signage in its produce aisle as early-season cherry and grape tomatoes from participating growers arrive at its stores in the U.S. Southeast.With the label, consumers can start ""supporting directly those companies who are willing to step up their game,"" said Gerardo Reyes, a staff member of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, which launched the Fair Food Program in 2011.

73,"  Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N) said on Thursday its sales at established restaurants in China dropped 15 percent in November but are improving from that level this month.""Our No. 1 priority is the China turnaround,"" Chief Executive Officer David Novak said at the company's investor and analyst conference in New York City.Yum, the owner of the KFC and Pizza Hut chains, is the largest Western restaurant operator in China, with more than 6,400 outlets. It reaps a significant portion of its sales and profits from the fast-growing market.On Tuesday, Yum lowered this year's profit forecast for the second time, citing a slower-than-expected sales recovery in China following a supplier scandal this summer. The company's new forecast called for full-year profit growth in the mid-single digits in percentage terms, excluding special items. It had cut the forecast to 6 percent to 10 percent from at least 20 percent.Sales at established KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants tumbled after a July 20 television news story in China alleged that supplier Shanghai Husi was using meat that was past its expiration date. Yum said it did only a small percentage of its business with the supplier at the center of the scandal and quickly cut ties with the firm's parent, major U.S. meat supplier OSI Group LLC.Food safety is a hot-button issue in China, which has been rocked by scandals, particularly involving melamine-tainted dairy products that sickened thousands of people and were linked to the deaths of six infants in 2008. Yum CEO Novak said in October it could take six to nine months for China sales to recover from the scandal.

74,"  (Corrects Reuters Instrument Code for McDonald's in paragraph five)SHANGHAI Dec 29 U.S. fast-food chain Subway is investigating media reports in China that workers at an outlet in Beijing doctored food labels and used produce beyond its expiry date, a Shanghai-based spokeswoman for the firm said on Monday.Chinese media reports that started circulating on Friday said workers at a Beijing outlet for Subway, which operates globally as a franchise business, changed expiry and production dates on meat, drink and vegetable produce to extend their use.""Our headquarters here is now investigating the matter,"" a Subway spokeswoman said. She said the firm had not reached any conclusions. ""We want to investigate what caused the labelling issue and whether or not it was the action of a single franchised outlet."" The issue highlights the difficulty firms have to control food quality and safety in supply chains and outlets in China, which can cause serious headaches with regulators and hit sales.Earlier this year, a China-based food supplier to McDonald's Corp and Yum Brands Inc was caught up in a scandal over workers allegedly tampering with expiry dates, which pummelled China sales at the fast-food chains. The Subway spokeswoman said the firm sent teams to inspect its franchises around the country each month and that it gave staff training on food safety and handling produce. The Beijing food regulator had also launched an investigation, she added.Food safety scandals in China are all too common, including recycled ""gutter oil"" for cooking, donkey meat products tainted with fox and one in 2008 involving tainted dairy products that led to the deaths of at least six infants.Subway, part of Doctor's Associate Inc, has close to 500 outlets in China, according to its official website.

75,"   By Adam Jourdan | SHANGHAI  SHANGHAI Jan 7 U.S. food supplier OSI Group LLC, which came under fire in China last year over allegations it used out-of-date meat, has criticised the handling of the case by the local food regulator, a rare act in China where firms are usually careful not to openly challenge the authorities.OSI's Shanghai Husi Food Co Ltd plant came under the spotlight in July when an undercover Chinese media report showed workers using out-of-date meat and doctoring production dates.The firm, which supplied international fast food chains including McDonald's Corp and Yum Brands Inc, launched a sweeping recall last summer that culminated on Sunday when it said it had destroyed the products.The Shanghai Food and Drug Administration, which is still investigating Shanghai Husi over the matter, called the food destroyed on Sunday ""questionable"" in a routine statement, prompting the strong objections from OSI. ""Without having any test results or even having done any testing on the relevant products, and with the case still under investigation, to define the products our company has voluntarily recalled as ""questionable"" ... is totally without factual, scientific or legal foundation,"" Shanghai Husi said in a statement in Chinese on the OSI China website.The statement said Chinese rules defined ""questionable"" food products as those which did not meet food safety standards or could be harmful for human health. OSI's criticism escalated a rare war of words between a foreign company and Chinese regulators, who over the past year have closely scrutinized international firms in industries ranging from automobiles to high tech.Microsoft Corp, for instance, has expressed deference to Chinese anti-monopoly regulators looking into its software sales practices -- even while U.S. business lobbies have complained about their companies being unfairly targeted. OSI's tussle with its Shanghai regulator also comes at a time when the central government in Beijing has acknowledged China's struggles to regulate tainted products.China's top food watchdog said on Wednesday food and drug safety in the country was ""grim"" and pledged stronger oversight in the wake of a string of food scandals which have hit the reputations of brands including McDonald's, Yum and retailers Carrefour SA and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.The Shanghai Husi scandal, which spread as far as Hong Kong and Japan, sparked a Chinese probe into the firm and dragged down Chinese sales at KFC-parent Yum and McDonald's. Both have since cut or suspended ties with Aurora, Illinois-based OSI.

76,"  (Adds background on Shanghai Husi, results)By Lisa BaertleinFeb 4 Yum Brands Inc, owner of KFC and Pizza Hut,  said on Wednesday that sales at established restaurants in its biggest market China fell less than feared in the fourth quarter as it fights to recover from a food scandal involving a minor supplier, and its shares jumped 2.1 percent.Same-restaurant sales in China, Yum's No. 1 market for revenue and profit, fell 16 percent for the quarter that ended Dec. 27 on continued fallout from allegations that a former supplier used expired meat.But the decline was less severe than the 19.4 percent drop expected by analysts polled by Consensus Metrix, and shares in Yum rose $1.51 to $75.16 in extended trading.The company's same-restaurant sales in China fell 14 percent in the third quarter ended Sept. 6. They rose 15 percent in the second quarter, which ended roughly a month before news of the supplier scandal surfaced on July 20.""While the sales recovery in China continues to be slower than expected, we anticipate a strong second half of 2015 as the turnaround gains momentum,"" Yum Chief Executive Greg Creed said in a statement. Sales at established KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants in China swooned after a television news story there alleged supplier Shanghai Husi was using meat past its expiration date.Yum, which has 6,715 restaurants in China, did not do significant business with Shanghai Husi and quickly cut ties with it and its parent, U.S. meat supplier OSI Group LLCStill, the scandal shook Chinese consumers, who have weathered a series of food safety lapses. OSI and its affiliates are major suppliers to McDonald's Corp, which on Jan. 23 reported a 4.8 percent decline in fourth-quarter sales at established restaurants for the region that includes China and Japan. Both of those McDonald's markets have been hard hit by the Shanghai Husi supplier scandal.Yum also reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $86 million, or 20 cents per share, versus its net profit of $321 million, 70 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding special items related to writing down its Little Sheep investment and gains from selling restaurants to franchisees, Yum had a profit of 61 cents per share in the latest quarter.

Third Point did not disclose how much it invested in Yum! It gave Yum! management strong marks for having tackled two food-safety problems in China over the past three years and said it was focused on narrowing the performance gap between its KFC and Pizza Hut brands and competitors.In China, Yum! operates 7,000 KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants in more than 1,000 cities and has three times as many restaurants as its closest competitor, McDonald's, the letter said.Loeb isn't alone in his newfound taste for the fast-food chain restaurant. Hedge fund manager Keith Meister, who runs Corvex Management, also took a stake earlier this year, a source familiar with his fund said. In addition to Yum!, Third Point took a new stake in Devon Energy (DVN.N), saying it could perform better as management begins to focus its ""capital in fewer, higher return areas"". The fund urged management to continue streamlining its portfolio and focus on top-tier U.S. assets in the Permian Basin, Eagleford, and Cana-Woodford.Devon's share price rose 0.59 percent to $68.61. Third Point is one of the hedge fund industry's most closely followed investors, in part because of its strong performance. Loeb has returned an average 20.5 percent for clients every year since 1995, more than double the Standard & Poor's 500 index.During the first quarter, Third Point gained 3.4 percent as bets on Actavis ACT.N, FANUC Corp (6954.T) and Dow Chemical (DOW.N) paid off even as bets on Alibaba (BABA.N), Ally Financial (ALLY.N) and Kroton Educacional SA (KROT3.SA) pinched.Overall, Third Point said there were still good bets to be made in U.S. stocks despite worries about an impending rate hike and the dollar's strength.

""We call it the motherfracker,"" he said, prompting investors to kick the share price down as much as 5.3 percent. The company should trade closer to $78 a share, he said, not the $166.50 the stock is trading at now.""Pioneer is burning cash and its reserves are not growing,"" said Einhorn, who runs $11 billion Greenlight Capital, adding ""Pioneer ought to stop touting estimates based on stale pricing."" The company is losing 20 cents of present value for every dollar it invests.Pioneer shares closed Monday at $168.33 a share, down 1.88 percent.Einhorn also mentioned EOG Resources Inc (EOG.N), which he called the “father fracker,” Concho Resources (CXO.N), Whiting Petroleum Corp (WLL.N) and Continental Resources Inc (CLR.N).Last year Einhorn unveiled a short bet against athenahealth Inc (ATHN.O) at a previous Sohn conference and was the first to underscore problems at Lehman Brothers months before the investment bank filed for bankruptcy.Einhorn was one of the few investors at the conference who unveiled a short bet, as most other investors put forth ideas that investors can buy and hold. Leon Cooperman and David Tepper talked about markets and sought to soothe investors fearful that the long-running  equities bull market might be over.Tepper, founder of Appaloosa Management, shocked markets a year ago by warning that investors should not be too long in the stock market. On Monday, he said that investors should not be ""too long bonds, not too short stocks"" and warned that investors should be careful with commodity investments.Investors at this conference, even the billionaires, are told to keep it short and talk no more than 15 minutes. Tepper who didn't use all of his time joked that he would sell some of his unused minutes to Bill Ackman, who is known for speaking at a breakneck pace to race through dozens and dozen of slides. Cooperman, who runs Omega Advisors and has long been saying the stock market would continue to climb, stuck by his bullish outlook, saying the stock market can still end higher this year. ""If there is a bubble out there, it is not in the stock market,"" Cooperman said, adding it may be in the fixed income market.He pitched a handful of U.S.-based companies including Google Inc (GOOGL.O), Dow Chemical Co (DOW.N), Priceline Group Inc (PCLN.O) and drugmaker Actavis Plc ACT.N.Picking up on the pharmaceutical industry theme, Larry Robbins, who runs Glenview Capital Management, touted AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N), saying the stock price could double. The company's price is relatively cheap and management is disciplined, Robbins said. Even though AbbVie called off a planned $55 billion takeover of Shire late last year, industry analysts are still holding out forecasts that the breakneck pace of mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry will continue. The company could be taken over or it could be the one taking over someone else, Robbins said. Ackman, founder and chief executive of Pershing Square Capital Management LP, talked about his most recent addition to the portfolio: Canadian pharmaceutical company Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO), which he called ""massively undervalued."" He said companies that buy up others at a steady pace are often misunderstood and said Valeant, which announced plans to buy Salix earlier this year, is an early stage Berkshire Hathaway, referring to Warren Buffett's company.Keith Meister, a former Carl Icahn lieutenant who now runs $8 billion Corvex Management, focused on fast food restaurant chain Yum Brands (YUM.N), saying his firm is one of the five largest investors and that the company is Corvex's second-biggest investment ever. On Friday Daniel Loeb's Third Point said it had taken a significant stake in Yum.Meister said Yum should spin off its China business, allowing a fully independent China company that appeals to the nation's large middle class. He said Yum's share could trade at least at $130, compared with the current price of $92.25, after the company spins off the China operation.A Yum spokeswoman said the company welcomes input from shareholders in trying to enhance shareholder value and added ""In any event, our focus is to get our China business back on track.""

Additionally, he said there is more chance to cut costs in the business in the United States.  The company's stock price has gained 22 percent so far this year amid growing interest from investors.Loeb was one of a handful of prominent investors speaking at the annual conference, better known as SALT, and several echoed the theme that investments in China make sense now.

119,"  MUMBAI, June 26 The Indian unit of fast food chain KFC, owned by Yum Brands Inc, on Friday challenged the results of a test showing the presence of bacteria linked to food poisoning in a sample of its fried chicken, dismissing them as ""false allegations"".Food safety has hit headlines in India after government food safety inspectors found excess lead in packets of Nestle's Maggi instant noodles.The company disputes the test results and a subsequent recall order, but it has become India's worst safety scare involving packaged food in a decade.On Friday, a children's rights group in the southern state of Telangana said it had submitted samples of KFC's fried chicken legs to the state food laboratory on June 18. The laboratory report, which was seen by Reuters, detailed traces of bacteria such as E.coli, which indicates the presence of sewage or animal waste, and salmonella. In a statement, KFC said it had not heard from any authorities and was unclear about the circumstances in which the samples were obtained.""There is no possibility of any microbial development in our food, which is freshly cooked at 170 degrees Celsius,"" it added, vowing to seek a clarification from the concerned authorities. Achyuta Rao, an official of APBHS, the group commissioning the tests, said it would submit a copy of the report to the office of the state's chief minister later on Friday.""This is a state laboratory report,"" he added.

120,"  * Q2 sales $3.11 bln vs est. $3.19 bln* Net income falls 30 pct to $235 mln* China same-store sales fall 10 pct   (Adds comment by company executive, background)By Yashaswini SwamynathanJuly 14 Yum Brands Inc, the owner of Pizza Hut and KFC, reported its fourth straight quarter of falling sales, indicating that the company is still struggling to regain lost ground in China after a food scandal last year.Yum's sales at established KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants in China have taken a hit ever since a television news story in July last year alleged that one of its suppliers was using meat that was past its expiration date. Food safety is a highly emotive subject in the country, where scandals ranging from toxic baby milk formula to dirty food oil are common. That makes convincing Chinese customers to come back to a tainted brand tough, marketing experts say.Yum's same-store sales in China plunged 10 percent in the second quarter, much steeper than the 8.40 percent fall analysts had expected, according to research firm Consensus Metrix.Hedge fund Third Point LLC, which took a stake in Yum in May, has said there is room for the company to split off its China business, a move that another stakeholder, Corvex Management, is pushing for. ""We are bullish on China over the long term and believe our best initiative right now is to get the business back on track,"" Yum's chief public affairs officer, Jonathan Blum, told Reuters.Adding to Yum's China woes, calorie-conscious Americans back home are turning to food perceived to be healthier, resulting in the company losing out to newer competitors such as Shake Shack Inc and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc in the United States.Yum said in May that it would remove artificial colors and flavors from food served in Pizza Hut and Taco Bell in an attempt to woo back diners. Despite its efforts, revenue fell 3 percent to $3.11 billion in the second quarter ended June 13 from a year earlier, missing the average analyst estimate of $3.19 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net income fell 30 percent to $235 million, or 53 cents per share.Yum also took a $68 million non-cash charge related to carrying down the value of real estate assets in Mexico.Excluding items, the company earned 69 cents per share, beating the average estimate of a profit of 62 cents.The company's shares fell 1 percent to $91 in extended trading to Tuesday.

Sales for both, which had steadily risen over the past decade, took a hit after Chinese regulators launched a probe into a local meat supplier last July for allegedly adding expired meat to its products.The safety scare was the second to hit the U.S. firms in China in as many years, and analysts said it became the tipping point for many families to stop eating at their restaurants.This lack of patronage becomes particularly painful as slower economic growth becomes the norm in China, and as consultants Euromonitor forecast growth in the already crowded fast food market to slow to around 4 percent by 2019, less than a third of the pace a decade earlier. ""The people who moved away were families and kids, these guys aren't coming back,"" said Ben Cavender, principal at China Market Research (CMR) Group. He said single professionals were flocking back to KFC and McDonald's at a faster pace than families, but cautioned that these consumers won't be enough to boost sales growth to pre-food scare levels.LOSS OF TRUST  CMR survey data suggests Chinese consumers trust in, and desire for, KFC and McDonald's has been falling since hitting a peak in 2010, with the decline accelerating since the 2012 food safety scare. Euromonitor data shows a similar trend: Yum's share of the market for fast food chains slipped to around 30 percent last year from nearly 40 percent in 2010 while McDonald's remained flat, as competition intensified from the likes of Ting Hsin International's Dicos, Ajisen China Holdings Ltd (0538.HK), Huai Lai Shi Catering and Kungfu Catering. Both U.S. firms have admitted China has become a tougher market since the food scare. In July, Yum executives said the recovery of China sales was taking longer than expected, citing the slowing economy and fierce competition.Yum declined to comment further for this story, while McDonald's China spokeswoman Jessica Lee said the firm was increasing its market share, without giving specifics.In a bid to revive their sales momentum in China, Yum and McDonald's are focusing on faster-growing segments of the fast food market such as pizza as well as customers in China's rapidly developing smaller cities. Yum is also expanding its premium coffee business and earlier this year set up a high-end restaurant, Atto Primo, in Shanghai to gauge customers' tastes.Trying to reassure consumers after the food scare, KFC opened more than 1,000 of its kitchens to Chinese diners while McDonald's has published a list of its suppliers online.Not all diners, however, are convinced.

Next week's slate has just a trickle of quarterly results, and as investors prep for the reporting period they'll be watching to see if markets can hold onto the late Friday rally in stocks after big early-day losses. Bond yields being lower could continue to make banks less attractive and utilities more so, while the expectation the Fed will raise rates - eventually, someday - should keep a steady base of support for the dollar.

On Thursday, metals company Aloca Inc will report third-quarter earnings amid an environment of low aluminum prices, thanks to a supply glut out of China. Analysts will be most interested in more details of the breakup of the company Alcoa announced on Sept. 28. The split separating its legacy smelting business from its value-added sales to the automotive and aerospace industries has left analysts with questions, including how debt and pension liabilities will be divided up between the two companies.  PepsiCo Inc is expected to report its third-quarter sales above analysts' average estimate on Tuesday. Strong sales growth in the company's developing markets, which include China, Africa and Latin America, is expected to make up for weak sales in the United States. PepsiCo had reported quarterly revenue growth in its Americas beverages business - its biggest- for just the second time in nearly four years in the second quarter. Investors will also look out for commentary on the performance of aspartame-free Diet Pepsi brands, which were launched in August in the United States following negative consumer feedback on the artificial sweetener.

While China's economy is cooling, Yum management also blamed internal missteps at its upscale Pizza Hut Casual Dining chain.The results come as hedge fund Corvex Management is urging Yum to spin off its 6,900-restaurant China business and prompted new calls for Creed to adopt a fresh strategy. Corvex did not respond to requests for comment. ""The stock is saying people are giving up on Yum. It will not change until management changes its strategy,"" said Hedgeye Risk Management analyst Howard Penney. At least six brokerages cut their stock price targets on Yum. Notably, Stifel went to $100 from $110 and Nomura to $82 from $106.Shares in Yum closed at $67.71, slightly above their session low of $67.20. Penney and other analysts say the China stumble gives proponents of a China spin-off more ammunition. Some also are calling on Yum to slow new restaurant development in China and to start selling existing units there to franchisees.    ""Spin off China, sell stores, do something,"" Penney said.Creed took the helm of Yum on Jan. 1 after leading a successful revamp of the company's Taco Bell chain. He was charged with turning around the China business, where sales have slumped since news in July 2014 that one of its suppliers used meat that was past its expiration date. He declined to comment on any strategic changes during a conference call with analysts and investors on Wednesday.""We continue to believe in China,"" Creed said, adding that the country remains the world's fastest-growing major economy. J.P. Morgan analyst John Ivankoe said now is an ideal time for Yum to adopt a lower-risk strategy for China, which in the last three years has been whipsawed by two food safety scandals and multiple marketing missteps. Among other things, an independent Yum China would pay a more predictable royalty to the company and allow Yum to take lease obligations off its balance sheet, he said.  ""Some spin-offs are done from a position of strength, but this one may be done from a position of weakness,"" Ivankoe wrote in a client note. WRONG FOCUS AT PIZZA HUT Creed said newly appointed management for the China business would bring fresh ideas and double down on profitable value meals to lure diners shocked by recent financial turmoil in the country.  China's Pizza Hut Casual Dining chain was hit particularly hard during its latest quarter as local businesses cut back on parties and events. Competition from online ordering companies that are operating at a loss also contributed to weak sales.That business accounts for one-third of profits from the China division, which is dominated by the KFC brand. Making matters worse, executives said Pizza Hut Casual Dining was promoting a premium-priced steak dish as the China economy softened. Going forward, Creed said the chain will refocus on value offerings such as pizza, pasta and chicken wings.Yum China contributed 57 percent of the company's overall revenue and 54 percent of its $603 million operating profit in the latest quarter.

145,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 08 (Fitch) Souring market sentiment on Yum Brands of late has  sent credit default sap (CDS) spreads to their widest level since 2009,  according to Fitch Solutions in its latest CDS Case Study Snapshot. Five-year CDS on Yum Brands Inc. have widened out 20% over the past month to  price at the widest levels observed since 2009. The CDS Implied Rating for Yum  has been dropping steadily over the past year, from 'A' to 'BBB' (based on CDS  trading patterns) while current CDS spreads are indicating 'BBB-' levels. 'Spread widening for Yum Brands is likely emanating from disappointing third  quarter earnings and risks to the company's growth given significant exposure to  China, which is experiencing an economic slowdown,' said Director Diana  Allmendinger. 'There are also increased concerns among bondholders that YUM's  financial strategy may become more aggressive, which may also weigh on CDS  spreads.'  China same-store sales turned positive (+2%) for the first time since June 2014  during the latest quarter, though the sales recovery is slower than management  anticipated. Moreover, YUM lowered EPS growth guidance to well below its target  of at least 10% annually and increased its dividend 12% while share repurchases  have continued.   Fitch Solutions case studies build on data from its CDS Pricing Service and  proprietary quantitative models, including CDS Implied Ratings. These credit  risk indicators are designed to provide real-time, market-based views of  creditworthiness. As such, they can and often do reflect more short term market  views on factors such as currencies, seasonal market effects and short-term  technical influences. This is in contrast to Fitch Ratings' Issuer Default  Ratings (IDRs), which are based on forward-looking fundamental credit analysis  over an extended period of time.

148,"  MOSCOW U.S. fast-food giant Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N) said on Friday it planned to keep up the pace of expansion of its KFC chain in Russia, seeing an opportunity in a crisis that is leading consumers to seek cheaper treats over fine meals.Russia is suffering its worst economic downturn since 1998 due to weak oil prices and Western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine conflict. The rouble has dropped, stoking inflation and squeezing consumer incomes and spending.Oleg Pisklov, head of Yum Restaurants International Russia, said it opened 100 KFC restaurants in Russia and neighboring former Soviet countries last year and planned to add around the same number this year and in 2016, despite the higher cost of imported materials due to the weaker rouble.KFC plans to grow in Russia, which accounts for the bulk of new openings in the region, by taking market share from restaurants with higher prices, after growth in consumer spending came to a halt, Pisklov told a press conference. ""Students, our key customers, have less money so fewer of them come to us, but on the other hand, people who used to visit mid-priced restaurants start coming to us more often as those restaurants become less affordable,"" he said.The unit's sales will rise 45 percent in 2015 after 30-40 percent growth on average in previous years.

150,"   By Lisa Baertlein | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Oct 20 Yum Brands Inc's  move to spin off its China business will allow investors to choose how much risk they are willing to stomach in the fast-food company's future.The company said on Tuesday it would split into two independent, publicly held companies by the end of next year - one focused on its nearly 6,900 KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants in China and one devoted to its roughly 35,000 restaurants elsewhere in the world.""It will get Yum Brands off the China roller coaster in a meaningful way and allow for better focus on enhancing the non-China business lines,"" Nomura analyst Mark Kalinowski said in a client note.Yum long has been a proxy for U.S. investment in China, and its business there still delivers more than half of the company's overall operating profit. But the company has suffered from increasingly frequent stumbles in China, including last year's scandal involving a minor supplier that allegedly was using meat past its expiration date.More recently, Yum in China has been hit by slowing economic growth in the country, growing competition from local food companies and its own marketing blunders.The company moved to spin off the jewel in its crown amid pressure from activist investor Corvex Management.That move suggests that Yum expects its China business to get more challenging, said Arthur Dong, a professor of strategy and economics at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business. ""This is not an encouraging sign,"" said Dong, who specializes in China. He admitted to having a ""glass half empty"" view on China, where fast-moving domestic restaurant competition is heating up as economic growth cools.Yum's KFC was a novelty when it debuted near Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1987 with a menu that included porridge and other local favorites. But times have changed.A crop of well-run homegrown eateries have sprung up. They offer everything from knock-off fried chicken menus to regional fare, and are becoming daunting competitors to Yum and other foreign brands, Dong said. ""They're the ones that are going to eat you alive,"" said Dong.Dong said franchising the China business would be one way for Yum to lower its risk. Right now, 93 percent of Yum's China restaurants are company-owned, meaning the company does everything from paying to build restaurants to reaping all of the rewards and risks associated with the day-to-day operations.Yum plans to reduce that ownership to 90 percent within the year and any future decisions about franchising in China will be made by the new company, spokesman Jonathan Blum said.The post-spin Yum Brands will include the non-China operations of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. Its struggling India division will be reabsorbed into the relevant brand segments. Yum Brands will receive a royalty stream from Yum China, which Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore said may be slightly lower than the typical rate.The more stable earnings stream will clear the way for the new Yum Brands to take on more debt, which would create opportunities for dividends, share buybacks or acquisitions that would benefit shareholders, Blum said.The company currently has substantially less debt than direct rivals such as Wendy's, Domino's Pizza, Dunkin' Brands or Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International, analysts said.Yum already has hinted that it plans to expand Taco Bell outside of its mostly U.S. base. That business had a third-quarter restaurant margin of 22.1 percent and was the only other Yum division to top Yum China's 19.6 percent restaurant margin.Although struggling in India, where sales at established restaurants tumbled 18 percent last quarter, it is in early days in countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia and South Korea, where young populations, wage growth and urbanization create opportunities, Morningstar analyst R.J.

Brands Inc.'s (YUM) announced separation of  its China operation into an independent publicly traded company has sent its  credit default swap (CDS) spreads spiking to their widest levels ever, according  to Fitch Solutions in its latest CDS Case Study Snapshot.   Five-year CDS on Yum! have continued to gap out, 98% wider in just the past  week, to price at all-time wide levels.  Additionally, CDS are currently pricing  deep in speculative grade territory, a stark contrast from the beginning of this  year. 'Spread widening for Yum! is being driven by the company's shift to a more  aggressive financial strategy and investors' expectation that the company will  lever up the company to return cash to shareholders,' said Diana Allmendinger.  'The spinoff means its leverage is likely to rise substantially.' In fact,  yesterday's spinoff announcement sent CDS spreads another 45% wider.  Fitch Solutions case studies build on data from its CDS Pricing Service and  proprietary quantitative models, including CDS Implied Ratings. These credit  risk indicators are designed to provide real-time, market-based views of  creditworthiness. As such, they can and often do reflect more short term market  views on factors such as currencies, seasonal market effects and short-term  technical influences.

170,"   By Lisa Baertlein and Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N) said it would return up to $6.2 billion to shareholders before separating its China business and listing it on the New York Stock Exchange, and possibly in Hong Kong.The KFC and Pizza Hut owner, which expects to spin off Yum China by the end of 2016, said the capital return could take various forms, including a share repurchase, tender offer or special dividend.Yum, which has been hit by food scandals and marketing missteps in China, also said same-restaurant sales in the country fell about 3 percent in November.The 6,900-restaurant China division accounted for 54 percent of Yum's overall operating profit in the third quarter, but sales at established restaurants in the country have fallen in four of the last five quarters.Still, the company said it was targeting earnings per share growth of about 15 percent annually for Yum China from 2017.Yum China will be domiciled in the United States, Yum Brands Chief Financial Officer Pat Grismer said at an investor conference in Plano, Texas on Thursday. Yum Brands shares were down 3 percent at $71.69 in late morning trading on Thursday.Yum China had $1 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) this year, and the ""New Yum,"" excluding China, had almost $2 billion in EBITDA this year, Grismer said.The Yum business, excluding China, will have a sustained leverage ratio of about 5 times EBITDA, the company said, citing the capital return plan. At present, the company's debt is on par with EBITDA. Yum Brands said it would receive a license fee of 3 percent of system sales in China, at the lower end of the 3-3.5 percent range analysts had expected.The lower China royalty - compared with the global royalty rate of 4-6 percent - gives operators in the country some breathing room, analysts said.The company said it expects 96 percent of its restaurants to be franchised by the end of 2017, up from 79 percent at the end of 2014. ""This implied rate of 4 percent company-owned stores should put the company more in line with some of the approaches we have seen taken by some other publicly traded companies that we find favorable,"" Nomura Securities analyst Mark Kalinowski wrote in a note.Most U.S.-based fast food chains, including McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) and Wendy's Co (WEN.O), are franchising out more restaurants to cut costs.Yum also said it would start testing out Taco Bell in China soon.

But that business has been besieged by food scandals and marketing missteps for the past two years, while the company also faces tough competition from nimbler rivals in the United States.The company's sales at established restaurants in China rose 2 percent, increasing for only the second time in six quarters. It was also marginally higher than analysts' estimates of a 1.9 percent increase, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. The increase in KFC's and Pizza Hut's system sales in the fourth quarter was the same as in the third quarter – up 6 percent at KFC and 2 percent at Pizza Hut.But, Conlumino analyst Hakon Helgesen said KFC system sales fell 5 percent in the latest quarter, including the effect of a strong dollar, while Pizza Hut system sales declined 2 percent.""One of the key issues for both brands is the relatively slim growth within the United States,"" Helgesen said. ""Both suffer from the challenge of maturity and, while they remain popular, the rather tired nature of the brands and a lack of meaningful menu innovation means they struggle to compete against rivals ...""Sales at Pizza Hut restaurants open for more than 13 months rose 1 percent in the quarter, less than analysts' estimates of a 1.5 percent rise.""Without the boost to growth provided by China, the legacy business will need to work much harder to reestablish its relevance,"" Helgesen said.

183,"   By Subrat Patnaik  Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N) reported an unexpected drop in fourth-quarter revenue as both its KFC and Pizza Hut restaurant outlets struggled to grow, hurt in part by the strong dollar.The company, which is spinning off its China business this year, said total revenue fell to $3.95 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 26, from nearly $4 billion a year earlier.Analysts on average were expecting sales to rise to $4.02 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company's shares dipped 1.4 percent to $71.45 in extended trading on Wednesday.Yum Brands gets about half its sales from China. But that business has been besieged by food scandals and marketing missteps for the past two years, while the company also faces tough competition from nimbler rivals in the United States.The company's sales at established restaurants in China rose 2 percent, increasing for only the second time in six quarters. It was also marginally higher than analysts' estimates of a 1.9 percent increase, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. The increase in KFC's and Pizza Hut's system sales in the fourth quarter was the same as in the third quarter – up 6 percent at KFC and 2 percent at Pizza Hut.But, Conlumino analyst Hakon Helgesen said KFC system sales fell 5 percent in the latest quarter, including the effect of a strong dollar, while Pizza Hut system sales declined 2 percent.""One of the key issues for both brands is the relatively slim growth within the United States,"" Helgesen said. ""Both suffer from the challenge of maturity and, while they remain popular, the rather tired nature of the brands and a lack of meaningful menu innovation means they struggle to compete against rivals ...""Sales at Pizza Hut restaurants open for more than 13 months rose 1 percent in the quarter, less than analysts' estimates of a 1.5 percent rise.""Without the boost to growth provided by China, the legacy business will need to work much harder to reestablish its relevance,"" Helgesen said.

184,"   By Adam Jourdan | SHANGHAI  SHANGHAI Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N), the home of KFC and Pizza Hut, is falling behind rival McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) as the pair battle to revive flagging sales in China - a headache for Yum as it looks to spin off operations in its biggest market.A Reuters analysis of same-store sales data suggests McDonald's is recovering faster in China than larger rival Yum as both seek to bounce back from a slew of food safety scandals dating back to 2012.  McDonald's said last week fourth-quarter same-store sales in China rose 4 percent, a second straight quarter of growth. On Wednesday, Yum said its same-store sales, reflecting underlying growth, also returned to growth in the second half - but more slowly, leaving annual China sales falling for the first time.Researchers and consumers said there's no simple answer to explain why McDonald's is faring better than Yum. A weaker economy and strengthening local rivals are among a complex cocktail of issues both firms must deal with in future strategy, including Yum's China spinoff, due later this year.Yum is still the largest fast food chain in China, but McDonald's has one in-built advantage: the country's diners remain particularly sensitive about chicken products, which were at the heart of the scandal in 2012.""Hearing all the rumours about chickens, I now very rarely go to KFC or eat McDonald's chicken wings."" said Yang Luo, 26, a sales manager in Shanghai. ""Hamburgers are okay, though.""Yum's 0.4 percent sales drop in 2015 in China, after two years of flatline growth, underlines how managers have struggled to repair its reputation. Chinese diners once flocked to its outlets - as well as to McDonald's - helping drive revenue growth of nearly 30 percent each year between 2006 and 2012. ""After the food scares erupted, me and my family didn't go for a long time to these fast food chains,"" said Zhao Ruoqing, 24, a student in the western Chinese city of Chengdu.""I'm not sure I totally trust either chain yet, but I now go to McDonald's when I'm in a rush because I prefer the atmosphere,"" said Zhao, adding he liked that the chain had maintained a more authentic American feel.'SILVER BULLET'  The Reuters analysis of same-store sales data suggests McDonald's is now outpacing Yum in efforts to restore sales to the level they were at before food safety crises. Same-store sales data reflects organic growth rather than that driven by new stores.The analysis, using same-store sales growth data to roughly track growth since a starting point in 2011, suggests Yum's sales are below 80 percent of the level they were then. McDonald's sales, meanwhile, are back to above 95 percent of that level.""The scandals have stuck to KFC much more than McDonald's in consumers' minds,"" said James Roy, Shanghai-based associate principal at China Market Research Group.

""We will continue to expand in China with a focus on our core products,"" she said in an email to Reuters.McDonald's officials in China didn't respond to requests for comment.The problem for Yum as it looks to revive its growth momentum is there is no single factor behind its China malaise, a senior Yum executive told Reuters.

186,"   By Adam Jourdan | SHANGHAI  SHANGHAI Small-scale brewers from Brooklyn to Beijing are tapping growing demand from cosmopolitan Chinese consumers for high-end beers, a trend which could also help global brewing giants finally unlock frothier profits in the world's largest beer market.    China is key for the biggest international beer brands as growth elsewhere stalls, accounting for half of the industry's global volume increase last year. But while China drinks a quarter of the world's beer, it accounts for only 3 percent of brewers' profits, Deutsche Bank analysts estimate.   ""The premium segment will be an important battle ground for brewers going forward because it will be the main growth driver,"" said Shanghai-based Rabobank analyst Katharine Song.    ""Brewers are adjusting their strategy to focus more on high-end products.""Until recently, volume and distribution networks have been the name of the game, driving global industry consolidation through ever larger deals and crushing margins. In 2004, about half the world market by volume was controlled by the biggest 10 brewers, according to industry data. By 2014, 47 percent of volumes and three-quarters of profits were controlled by just four brewers - AB InBev (ABI.BR), SABMiller SAB.L, Heineken NV (HEIN.AS) and Carlsberg (CARLb.CO).That number is soon to drop to three, with the planned $100 billion-plus takeover of SAB Miller by AB Inbev.FOLLOW THE MONEY  Last week's sale by AB InBev of SAB Miller's 49 percent stake in China's top selling brand Snow to China Resources Beer (0291.HK) for an unexpectedly low $1.6 billion was primarily aimed at satisfying regulators and wrapping up the merger.    Critically, it also freed up SAB Miller to focus on more lucrative bets in the Chinese market than a beer which sells at 50 U.S. cents a bottle, or less.The focus on premium products reflects a shift in China's 1.4 billion consumers, who now want more tailored and individual products from fast-food to travel - a headache for firms from KFC-owner Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N) to luxury goods maker Prada SpA (1913.HK).Premium beers are expected to make up over a third of the $80 billion Chinese market by the end of the decade - compared to less than 10 percent in 2010. Imported high-end beers saw a 60 percent jump last year as consumers splashed out on brews such as ""Hop Zombie"" and ""Armageddon IPA"".         THINK DIFFERENT     For drinkers like bar owner Chen Jiaqi, who flew over 400 miles (640 km) to Shanghai from the central Chinese city of Wuhan to sample a New Zealand craft ale, it is about individuality.    ""I think more and more Chinese customers are about the flavor of the beer itself, and if the beer is unique and rare then they will choose it,"" said Chen.    That comes at a cost.    A bottle of craft ale costs around 30 yuan ($4.6) in Shanghai, around ten times more than the cheapest mass-market beers from Tsingtao Brewery Co Ltd (600600.SS) or CR Beer.     ""It is rare and unique and the flavors are better,"" said Hao Xiaowei, a 33-year-old nurse, while she drank a Bavarian wheat beer at a craft bar in downtown Shanghai.    ""It's worth spending the extra money.""    That willingness to splash out has attracted a host of small craft brewers such as Scotland BrewDog and New York's Brooklyn Brewery, who have started actively targeting China.    ""China's on the hit list to tackle in the near future,"" said Luke Raven, director at Ilkley Brewery in northern England which has craft beers with names like ""Hanging Stone"" and ""Holy Cow"".  Craft beers won't appeal to all, but a willingness to spend more to stand out from the crowd will also support mainstream imported brands like Budweiser, Heineken or Japan's Asahi.    Premium beer sales grew just under 25 percent last year versus 7.5 percent growth in the overall market, Euromonitor data shows.     ""Sometimes people choose premium beers – Heineken or Carlsberg for example - because it has a marketing angle or image, a certain attraction like going for a coffee to Starbucks,"" said Michael Jordan, brewmaster for Boxing Cat Brewery in Shanghai, which makes craft beers using local ingredients such as Sichuan peppercorns and goji berries.    ""It's a kind of status symbol.""

187,"  BANGKOK Thailand's Minor International Pcl (MINT.BK) plans to invest 40 billion baht ($1.13 billion) over the next five years in a major  expansion of its hotel and fast-food chain businesses at home and overseas, a senior executive said on Wednesday. Chaiyapat Paitoon, vice president for strategic planning, said more than half that overall sum will be used to build up existing operations, with about 14-15 billion baht set aside for acquisitions. The company will use internal cash and debt financing to fund the investment, he said.  The firm aims to raise the number of hotels it operates to 210 by 2020 from 145 now, he said, while targeting an increase in the number of its domestic and foreign fast-food outlets to 3,100 by 2020 from 1,851 currently. Minor, which owns stakes in hotels run under the Four Seasons, Marriott and St. Regis brands in Bangkok, as well as Oaks in Australia, is aiming to secure net profit growth of at least 15 to 20 percent a year during 2016-2020, Chaiyapat said, speaking during an earnings presentation.The company said its 2015 net profit jumped 60 percent from a year earlier to 7 billion baht, citing robust growth in the hospitality business and gains from revaluation of investments related to acquisitions in Africa and Australia. Minor, which competes with the likes of Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried Chicken owner Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N), as well as Central Plaza Hotel PCL (CENTEL.BK), has been aggressive in acquisitions overseas seeking to expand high-margin food and hotel businesses. Minor runs Burger King, Sizzler, Swensen's and The Pizza Company outlets across Asia. Revenue from overseas operations will rise to 50 percent of the total amount by 2020 from 45 percent now, Chaiyapat said, adding Minor has temporarily closed some restaurants in Singapore for renovation after weak performance.     Despite China's economic slowdown, Minor continues to expand food outlets in the country. But expansion will not be ""as aggressive"" as in the past few years, Chaiyapat said. The firm will focus on cost controls as a means to improve profit in the country, where sales rose 24 percent last year. The executive said the company is also looking for opportunities to expand the Tivoli brand internationally. Minor  paid 294 million euros to acquire 14 Tivoli brand hotels in Portugal and Brazil in February.

203,"  (Adds missing word in first paragraph)HONG KONG/SINGAPORE, April 20 A group of investors comprising sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp (CIC), KKR & Co and Baring Private Equity Asia is in talks to buy a controlling stake in Yum Brands Inc's  China unit, people familiar with the matter said.Yum Brands, owner of the Pizza Hut and KFC fast food chains plans to spin off its 6,900 China restaurants by the end of 2016. The China unit accounts for about half of its parent's total sales and is valued at about $10 billion, based on its core earnings, bankers and analysts estimate.The U.S.-based company had initially planned to sell a stake of about 20 percent in the China operation to anchor investors ahead of a planned listing of the business in New York Exchange and possibly in Hong Kong.But the deal structure is being reworked as acquiring a minority stake is less appealing for buyout firms, making it difficult for them to secure debt funding to finance the deal. It wasn't immediately clear how much the investor group plans to pay for Yum's China business. Bloomberg first reported the news and said the deal could vale Yum China at between $7 billion-$8 billion..According to people familiar with the transactions, speaking on condition of anonymity because the talks were confidential, it was unclear whether Yum would agree to sell a majority stake, as disposing of more than 20 percent of the China business would attract a higher tax bill. Yum, still the largest fast food chain in China, has been losing ground to McDonald's Corp as both strive to revive flagging sales in the teeth of growing competition from local rivals and a slowing economy.McDonald's itself is changing its business model in Asia by planning to bring in partners to own a majority of its restaurants within a franchise operation. Chinese diners once flocked to Yum outlets - and to McDonald's - helping drive revenue growth of nearly 30 percent a year between 2006 and 2012. But Yum's China sales dipped 0.4 percent in 2015, after two flat years, underlining how managers have struggled to repair its reputation since the food safety scares.CIC, KKR and Baring declined to comment.Yum said in a statement that it is making good progress since it announced the planned separation of Yum and Yum China and will provide updates on the transaction at appropriate times. It didn't comment on any potential deal with the group of investors.Yum shares dropped 0.6 percent on Tuesday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3 percent.

Louisville, Kentucky-based Yum Brands, owner of the Pizza Hut and KFC fast food chains, aims to spin off its 7,205 China restaurants by the end of 2016, amid pressure from activist investor Corvex Management, whose founder, Keith Meister, is on Yum's board.The second round of bids for the stake up for sale - around 20 percent of the business - are due by the end of this month, the people said, declining to be identified because the information was confidential.Yum's entire China unit is valued between $8 billion and $11 billion, based on its core earnings of about $1 billion, the people said.""I will tell you as a large shareholder, the Yum board selling this business for $7 or $8 billion is not the right thing, and I don't think anyone would disagree about that,"" Corvex's Meister told CNBC in a recent interview. Corvex owns 5.2 percent of Yum, according to Thomson Reuters data.Yum, still the largest fast food chain in China, has been losing ground to McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) as they both strive to revive flagging sales in the teeth of growing competition from local rivals and a slowing economy. In the latest quarter, Yum's China sales grew faster than Wall Street estimates, raising expectations that a key profit driver for Yum is showing signs of stability after battling many quarters of disappointing sales.Yum shares haven risen 9.7 percent in New York so far this year, while the S&P 500 Index .SPX has been flat in the same period.Some bidders would be keen to buy control of the China business, the people said, but they noted that Yum is sticking to the minority stake sale plan because it is more tax-efficient. It was not clear if these bidders would pursue a transaction if Yum does not adjust plans and offer a controlling stake for sale, the people said.A Yum spokeswoman declined to comment on prospective bidders. She said, ""We continue to make good progress since we announced the transaction separating Yum and Yum China into powerful, independent, focused companies by the end of 2016."" KKR and Temasek declined to comment. China sovereign wealth fund CIC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. While Temasek, which manages about $190 billion in assets, has about 28 percent of its portfolio in the financial sector, it has been placing more bets in consumer companies of late.In 2014, it bought almost a quarter of health and beauty retailer A.S. Watson, backed by Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, for about $5.7 billion in its single biggest investment. Last year it was also part of a private equity consortium led by MBK Partners that bought British supermarket retailer Tesco PLC's (TSCO.L) South Korea business.

CIC's consortium also had concerns around achieving the  investment returns it desires in a capital-intensive business amid a slowing Chinese economy, the people added, asking not to be identified because the negotiations were confidential.""Our board is fully committed to maximizing shareholder value, and we are making great progress towards the separation of our China business by year-end and at the same time returning significant capital to our shareholders,"" a Yum spokeswoman said. ""Our China business is a large, unique and valuable asset ... We're confident that, as a well-capitalized, standalone public company, it will have a long runway for continued growth,"" she added.KKR declined to comment, while CIC did not respond to a request for comment. Separately on Friday, Yum unveiled a $4.2 billion share buyback and declared a quarterly dividend of 46 cents per share. The move follows its previous commitment to return $6.2 billion of capital to shareholders before the planned separation of its China business. Yum, still the largest fast-food chain in China, has been losing ground to McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) as they both strive to revive sales in the teeth of growing competition from local rivals and a slowing economy. In recent years, it has sought to address challenges in supply chain control and food safety. It is common for newly public listed companies in China to secure so-called ""anchor investors"" prior to a public listing. The spin-off is expected to proceed with or without an anchor investor.The auction for a roughly 20 percent stake in Yum's China unit also includes Singapore state investor Temasek Holding and another private equity-backed consortium, Reuters reported this week. Second round bids for the auction are due by the end of this month. Questions continue to persist around valuation, as Yum pursues its China unit spin. The entire China unit is valued between $8 billion and $11 billion, based on its core earnings of about $1 billion, according to the sources.

The company's total revenue slipped 3 percent to $3.01 billion for the second quarter. Net income rose to $339 million or 81 cents per share from $235 million or 53 cents per share a year earlier. Adjusted earnings per share were 75 cents, a penny higher than the Wall Street consensus calculated by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Company executives will host a conference call with analysts and investors on Thursday morning.

221,"   By Rodrigo Campos | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Financial stocks led the S&P 500 and the Dow industrials to record highs on Thursday after JPMorgan's strong quarterly results, while upbeat economic data cemented bets that the current rally on Wall Street can chug along.JPMorgan (JPM.N), the biggest U.S. bank by assets and the first among its peers to issue results this earnings season, reported a much better-than-expected rise in quarterly revenue.The bank's shares rose 1.5 percent to $64.12, while the S&P financial index .SPSY rose 0.89 percent.Support for stocks came also in the form of strong U.S. economic data. Filings for unemployment benefits unexpectedly held steady near a 43-year low last week, while producer prices recorded their biggest gain in a year in June.Besides banks, cyclical sectors like materials, technology and consumer discretionary, expected to outperform in an environment of economic expansion, also posted strong gains while the only sector to post a loss was defensive utilities.""We had a couple of good data points and on that basis the market has continued to grind higher,"" said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors in New York.Despite lauding JPMorgan, Orlando was skeptical its peers could match the bank's results.""Not everyone is able to operate as well as JPMorgan,"" he said. ""They've shown us what's possible with good management but that doesn't mean everyone will perform equally well."" Six banks report earnings on Friday including S&P 500 components Wells Fargo (WFC.N) and Citigroup (C.N). The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 134.29 points, or 0.73 percent, to 18,506.41, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 11.32 points, or 0.53 percent, to 2,163.75 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 28.33 points, or 0.57 percent, to 5,034.06.The S&P and Dow closed at record highs. The S&P hit 2,168.99, its fourth straight intraday record peak, while the Dow hit 18,537.57 to mark its third straight intraday record high.The S&P 500 materials index .SPLRCM gained 0.8 percent, boosted partly by Monsanto's (MON.N) 3.1 percent increase to $104.22 after Bayer (BAYGn.DE) raised its offer for the seed and pesticide company. Completing a stocks trifecta with strong data and upbeat earnings, monetary policy is expected to continue to support higher prices both in the United States and globally.Atlanta Federal Reserve President Dennis Lockhart said the Fed should remain ""cautious and patient"" with any future interest rate increases, while the Bank of England, although it kept rates on hold on Thursday, held out the prospect of a stimulus package soon to help the economy cope with Britain's vote last month to leave the European Union.The more upbeat view on equities brought down the cost of protection against a decline on the S&P 500. The CBOE Volatility index .VIX closed at its lowest in 11 months.Results so far have been reassuring. KFC owner Yum Brands (YUM.N) rose 3 percent to $88.27 a day after its key China business showed signs of strength. Delta's (DAL.N) higher-than-expected quarterly profit sent its shares 3.6 percent higher.

222,"   By Rodrigo Campos | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. stocks ticked up on Wednesday, just enough for the S&P 500 and Dow industrials to set record highs, with investors expecting upbeat earnings to keep the rally going.Following three days of strong gains on the back of economic data, focus has turned to Thursday's meeting at the Bank of England, expected to turn to quantitative easing as it tries to shield the economy from the fallout of Britain's vote last month to leave the European Union. Continued support from monetary policies across the developed world and strong economic data in the United States have given investors a reason to bid growth-sensitive sectors of the stock market. This turn to cyclical stocks could help take the rally beyond the current record highs.""The bias is to extend the current rally mainly because (U.S. economic) data that we've gotten so far has been supportive,"" said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin.He said the BOE and bank earnings will take the focus this week and the sectors more likely to post revenue surprises during the current earnings season are consumer discretionary, healthcare, industrials and materials. ""New records came just before we started earnings and strong earnings are going to be essential. Fundamentals are going to be the basis for the market to move forward.""While second-quarter earnings of S&P 500 companies are currently expected to fall 5 percent, the typical beat would indicate the first quarter marked a bottom for the earnings contraction. Most on Wall Street expect growth to resume in the second half of the year.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 24.45 points, or 0.13 percent, to 18,372.12; the S&P 500 ticked up 0.29 points, or 0.01 percent, to 2,152.43 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 17.09 points, or 0.34 percent, to 5,005.73. The S&P and Dow closed at record highs.It was the more defensive sectors that buoyed the S&P 500 after having lagged over the past few days. Telecoms, utilities and consumer staples were the top percentage gainers.The S&P 500 energy sector dropped 0.7 percent after leading the market on Tuesday, as a steep rally in crude futures prices reversed almost fully. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.15-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.41-to-1 ratio favored decliners.The S&P 500 posted 54 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 124 new highs and 14 new lows.

225,"   By Lisa Baertlein | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Consumer groups will deliver a petition from more than 350,000 people to the KFC restaurant chain on Wednesday, calling on the Yum Brands Inc unit (YUM.N) to stop the routine use of antibiotics by the companies that supply its chicken.Several fast-food restaurants, which have been under fire for selling unhealthy meals, are assuming the role of public health change agent by forcing their respective meat suppliers to adopt new practices aimed at keeping vital antibiotics working.KFC has said that by 2017, antibiotics important to human medicine will only be used to maintain chicken health and only under the supervision and prescription of a licensed veterinarian. But critics say that policy effectively allows for routine use of antibiotics by its chicken suppliers.As per federal government guidance, KFC does not allow the use of such antibiotics for growth promotion. Medical experts warn that the routine use of antibiotics to promote growth and prevent illness in healthy farm animals contributes to the rise of drug-resistant ""superbug"" infections that kill at least 23,000 Americans each year and represent a ""catastrophic threat"" to global health.More than 70 percent of medically important antibiotics in the United States are sold for use on livestock and poultry. McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) last week said it switched to chicken raised without antibiotics important to human health, months ahead of schedule.Chick-fil-A Inc, which has surpassed KFC to become the No. 1 U.S. fast-food chicken chain by revenue, has vowed to fully transition to chicken raised without any antibiotics by the end of 2019. KFC 'LAGGING' ""KFC is lagging woefully behind. Diners around the country want KFC to step up,"" said Lena Brook, food policy advocate with the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), one of the groups delivering petitions to KFC's headquarters in Louisville, Kentucky.KFC spokeswoman Kasey Mathes said on Wednesday the company was reviewing its position on antibiotics to determine the viability for its suppliers to go beyond the FDA guidelines for antibiotics usage.Yum's Taco Bell and Pizza Hut restaurants have set 2017 deadlines for switching to chicken raised without antibiotics important to human health. KFC, which purchases more chicken than those two chains, has not matched that commitment. ""These lifesaving drugs should be used only when animals are sick,"" said Steven Roach, food safety program director at the Food Animals Concern Trust. FACT and U.S. Public Interest Research Group Education Fund also sent representatives to deliver the KFC petitions. The Center for Science in the Public Interest and CREDO Action also collected signatures.That action comes a day after Yum investors submitted a shareholder proposal requesting that the company quickly phase out harmful antibiotic use in its meat supply. [L1N1AP24M]The World Health Organization has warned that the world is moving toward a post-antibiotic era in which many infections would no longer be treatable because of the overuse of antibiotics. Two U.S. patients are known to have been infected with bacteria carrying the mcr-1 superbug gene that makes germs highly resistant to a last-resort class of antibiotics.The mcr-1 gene has been found over the past six months in farm animals and people in about 20 countries, including China, Germany and Italy.Health officials fear the mcr-1 gene will soon be found in bacteria already resistant to all or virtually all other types of antibiotics, potentially making infections untreatable.Such discoveries have increased the urgency of calls to reduce antibiotic use in beef and pork production. In April, 54 large investors launched a campaign to curb the use of antibiotics in the meat and poultry served by 10 large U.S. and British restaurant groups, including Yum.(Corrects to ""chicken raised without any antibiotics"" from ""chicken raised with antibiotics"" in paragraph 7) (Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles, editing by G Crosse)",2016-08-10,YUM,"Wed Aug 10, 2016 | 5:05pm EDT",CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-Consumer groups press Yum's KFC to tighten antibiotic rules,http://www.reuters.com//article/yum-brands-kfc-antibiotics-idUSL1N1AR0MA?type=companyNews

230,"   By Michael Flaherty  KFC and Pizza Hut owner Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N) said Chinese investment firm Primavera Capital and an affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) will buy a stake in Yum China for $460 million as Yum prepares to spin off the business.The deal gives Primavera, a powerful China-focused private equity firm founded by an ex-Goldman Sachs banker, a significant stake in Yum's China business. It also further expands the reach of Ant Financial, which runs Alibaba's Alipay mobile payments platform and has been expanding into China's restaurant industry.The investors will receive warrants to buy an additional 4 percent stake in Yum China in two tranches at valuations of $12 billion and $15 billion, the company said on Friday.A Yum spokesman said the use of the proceeds from the deal will be determined by the future Yum China board of directors. Yum has signaled that part of the money could go toward expanding across China, as the company signaled last October that it hoped to nearly triple the amount of its restaurants in China to 20,000.KFC and Pizza Hut brands reaped the rewards of catering to China's booming economy, with patrons flooding the restaurants that offered fast Western food, a higher level of service and perceived food safety.  But Yum's China business has hit road blocks in recent years, including a scandal at a minor meat supplier and bird flu outbreaks.Yum, still the largest fast-food chain in China, has also been losing ground to McDonald's Corp (MCD.N). The Louisville, Kentucky-based company's move to separate its China business followed pressure last year from one of its largest investors, Corvex Management, the activist hedge fund run by Keith Meister. Meister is on Yum's board. The spinoff is expected on Oct. 31, with Yum China to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange a day later, the company said on Friday.Primavera will invest $410 million, while Ant Financial, which runs Alibaba's Alipay mobile payments platform, will put in $50 million. China's sovereign wealth fund and New York private equity firm KKR & Co were also in the hunt for a Yum China stake.Primavera's founder, Fred Hu, will become non-executive chairman of Yum China's board.

245,"   By Lisa Baertlein  Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N), owner of KFC and Pizza Hut, blamed tensions over the South China Sea for an unexpected dip in quarterly sales at its established restaurants in China.The company, which will spin off its China business on Oct. 31, said the last quarter started well there, but its restaurants there were hit by anti-U.S. protests after an international court rejected China's claim to historic rights in the South China Sea. ""If not for this event, we believe the China Division would have delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth,"" Chief Executive Officer Greg Creed said.Sales at Yum China restaurants open at least one year fell 1 percent during the third quarter ended on Sept. 3. The protests reduced the measure by as much as 500 basis points, but the impact has largely eased, executives said on a conference call on Thursday. Analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix had expected a 4.1 percent sales gain for the China unit, which is Yum's top profit generator. An international tribunal in the Hague said in July it found no legal basis for China's claim to most of the South China Sea. This prompted local media to call the court a ""puppet"" of external forces and accuse the United States of turning the Philippines, which filed the case, against China.Several brands were caught up in short-lived anti-U.S. protests and calls for a boycott, including Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and KFC, which has more than 5,000 restaurants across China. Some analysts questioned the extent of the impact of the sporadic protests in China, where Yum is also battling tough competition, lingering effects of food safety missteps and a weak economy.""We estimate sales dropped 15 to 25 percent in some of the cities because a lot of the protesters were looking for a big American brand to attack, to protest against,"" said Shaun Rein, managing director of Shanghai-based China Market Research Group. ""So they did have to shut a lot of stores in Northeast China.""The big challenge for them is, will there be lingering anti-American sentiment?""

248,"   By Lisa Baertlein  Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N), owner of Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell chains, said on Tuesday it will more than double returns to shareholders by 2019 as part of a program started last year, sending its shares up as much as 3.8 percent.The company, which is spinning off its China division at the end of the month, now plans to expand its share buyback plan to $13.5 billion, including dividends.It already has bought back about $5.5 billion shares as part of a previously announced $6.2 billion capital return program that has reduced its share count by about 16 percent.Yum did not immediately have a breakdown on much of the extra returns would be from share repurchases and how much from dividends.Executives say Yum Brands will be leaner and less exposed to the ups and downs of the restaurant business following the separation of Yum China and the sale of more company-owned restaurants to franchisees.  ""It's about delivering higher growth with lower risk,"" Yum Brands Chief Executive Officer Greg Creed told Reuters in a telephone interview.Yum said franchisees will own 93 percent of the nearly 36,000 Yum restaurants remaining in the company after the China unit is carved off. The combined company currently is 77 percent franchised, in part because Yum China owns most of its restaurants.Yum Brands aims to have at least 98 percent of its restaurants owned by franchisees by the end of 2018, which will lower costs and increase its dependence on more stable franchise and license fees.  Yum's China business will begin trading on Nov. 1 on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol YUMC. The new company, Yum China Holdings Inc, will become a licensee of Yum Brands in mainland China and will have exclusive rights there to KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. Yum China now accounts for 45 percent of Yum Brands' earnings, a contribution expected to fall to 14 percent after the spinoff, when Yum China will begin paying Yum Brands a license fee of 3 percent of restaurant system sales, Creed said.The company plans to reduce annual capital expenditures to about $100 million in 2019 from about $500 million in 2015 and cut general and administrative expenses by a cumulative $300 million by fiscal 2019. About half of that $300 million in new savings will come from shifting restaurant expenses to new franchisees, the remainder will come from job eliminations and tighter expense controls on things like travel, Creed said.Yum last week reported its first same-store sales drop in five quarters in China, blaming anti-U.S. protests after an international court rejected China's claim to historic rights in the South China Sea.Shares in Yum were up 1.1 percent at $88.31 after hitting a session high of $90.68.
