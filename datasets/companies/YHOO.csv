8,"  JERUSALEM Jan 21 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday he hoped to persuade business leaders from the global high tech sector attending this week's annual economic forum in Davos to invest more in Israel.High tech products account for nearly half of industrial exports from Israel, whose economy is expected to grow at a healthy clip of 3.3 percent this year.Netanyahu, who will be joined in the Swiss Alpine resort by senior Israeli officials including central bank governor Karnit Flug, said he would hold talks with the chief executive of Yahoo  and a top executive of Google. ""My intention is to speak with the leading global companies in high-tech, in cyber and other areas, to tell them to come to Israel (and) invest in Israel,"" Netanyahu said in a statement. ""We managed the global economic crisis better than almost all Western countries. But we can't rest on our laurels. We need to develop new markets and new partners and this is my goal in travelling to the economic conference in Davos.""Israel's economy also grew 3.3 percent in 2013 and by 3.4 percent in 2012. Foreign direct investment in Israel was about $10.5 billion in the first three quarters of 2013, above the $9.5 billion seen for the whole of 2012, according to the Bank of Israel.In Davos, Netanyahu also plans to meet the leaders of Australia, Mexico and China, among others.",2014-01-21,YHOO,"Tue Jan 21, 2014 | 2:05pm EST",REFILE-Israeli PM to target tech investors at Davos forum,http://www.reuters.com//article/netanyahu-davos-idUSL5N0KV3LI20140121?type=companyNews
9,"   By Jessica Toonkel, Olivia Oran and Soyoung Kim | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Corporate raiders, long scorned by Wall Street, are gaining new credibility as activist investors, to the point that some investment banks are eager to bestow on them a new title: valued customer.Big Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) are still content to defend corporate America against investors like Carl Icahn and Dan Loeb, who take large stakes in companies with the hopes of effecting such changes as spinning off a division, cutting costs or ousting management.Protecting the corporate castle is profitable work, part of nearly $70 billion in corporate fees generated by investment banks annually, and big banks fear upsetting their best clients.Smaller investment banks, though, see a new source of revenue: Working with investors on one corporate campaign could help them win future assignments from another company, which may seek defensive services from banks familiar with the inner workings of activists.Getting involved in a merger-and-acquisition transaction is also opportune if the target company ultimately pursues a sale of itself under investor pressure.That's a potentially attractive proposition for an industry still grappling with slow dealmaking activity in the wake of the financial crisis. U.S. M&A fees last year were still down 27 percent from 2007, at $15.9 billion, according to data from Thomson Reuters and Freedman & Co.""I keep getting calls from people who want to be in this space. Bankers are trying to figure out 'how can I charge for working with activists?'"" said Steve Wolosky at Olshan Frome Wolosky LLP, a top lawyer for activist investors such as Starboard Value LP.""Everyone is expecting the big banks to start doing this … the answer as to when is 'follow the money,'"" said a banker at a large firm that has discussed working with activists.""It's not that different from what happened with the private equity firms in the 1980s. No one wanted to work with the 'barbarians' until they realized it was very lucrative,"" he added, asking not to be named because he was not authorized to speak with the media.Boutique banks including Houlihan Lokey, Moelis & Co and Blackstone Group LP's (BX.N) advisory group have worked with investors such as Barington Capital, Starboard and Pershing Square Capital on their activist campaigns.Evercore Partners Inc (EVR.N) and Jefferies LLC are also keeping a close eye on the trend, several bankers said.Activist investors have become more respectable in recent years after a series of campaigns that brought about changes seen as instrumental to companies' success. Loeb, for instance, made a handsome profit for himself and his investors from his two-year crusade to increase Yahoo Inc's (YHOO.O) value. The shares, which were around $13 before got involved, now trade near $40. He was also instrumental in naming former Google Inc (GOOG.O) executive Marissa Mayer as Yahoo's chief executive officer.On Wednesday alone, Icahn urged e-commerce giant eBay (EBAY.O) to spin off its PayPal arm and renewed an attack on Apple Inc (AAPL.O) to return cash to shareholders. Loeb revealed a major stake in Dow Chemical Co (DOW.N) and urged the largest U.S. chemical maker to spin off its petrochemical unit.The number of activist campaigns against U.S. corporations has increased 20 percent over the last few years, according to FactSet Shark Watch, from 198 in 2010 to 236 last year.While large activist firms mostly have the team and reputation to take on a fight without outside aid, other activists hire Wall Street advisors to render campaigns more believable, to perform financial analysis and sometimes to find potential buyers for the target company.ADDING HEFT For smaller or new activist investors, enlisting a bank helps to ""show they are serious because they are paying the bank a significant fee to do the work and use their name,"" said Gregg Feinstein, head of the M&A group at Houlihan Lokey.Houlihan, which also defends companies against activist campaigns, represented its first activist publicly in 2011 when it assisted Orange Capital in its campaign against Australian REIT Charter Hall Office Management. Orange succeeded in its push, which included the sale of its U.S. portfolio. Houlihan is now helping Barington Capital to persuade Darden Restaurants Inc (DRI.N) to break up into two separate companies and to spin off its real estate.Moelis advised Starboard Value during the hedge fund's push for Smithfield Foods Inc to break itself up rather than sell to Shanghui International Holdings Ltd.Blackstone will work with corporate clients as well as activists, including Pershing Square, the hedge fund founded by William Ackman. The bank helped Ackman when the billionaire invested in Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd (CP.TO).Some bankers work with activists because they are attracted by the opportunities to build relationships with investors, who often manage to secure board seats at major corporations.""Many banks use the activist product as a means toward securing future mandates from a corporate client, including takeover defense or ultimately the sale of the company,"" said Tom Stoddard, a senior managing director at Blackstone.Banks working with activists generally charge a flat fee, a percentage of the gains the activist receives if the campaign is successful, and an additional fee if the activist publicly discloses the bank's name, according to several people familiar with these arrangements. The flat fees can range anywhere from $250,000 to $1 million, and the percentage of investor gains bankers earn can be anywhere from one to 5 percent, these sources said, asking not to be named because the information is not public.It is hard to generalize fees because often caps and credits are associated with these structures, one of the sources added.Banks fending off a high-profile attack can make from a few hundred thousand dollars to $2 million in monthly flat fees, on top of a success fee as high as $7 million to $8 million, according to one industry banker.""People are willing to pay higher fees if you fight people like Carl Icahn than if you are fighting a new kid on the block,"" the banker said.Such fees are only a tiny fraction of what Wall Street banks generate from deals ranging from capital market transactions to mergers and acquisitions.Computer maker Dell Inc's $25 billion buyout by founder Michael Dell last year, for example, created $458 million worth of investment banking fees in 2013, according to Thomson Reuters data.That reliance on corporations for revenue explains why it's still rare that banks work with activists.But as investors become more common in the boardroom and the amount of money activists make grows, more banks may change their view, said Lyle Ayes, managing director and head of shareholder activism practice at New York-based Evercore(EVR.N).When Evercore brought on Ayes early last year, one of his first mandates was to help decide if the firm should represent activists.In the end, Evercore decided against the idea. ""It's too close to home for too many of our important clients."" Still, he added: ""Evercore asked the question before I arrived, they asked when I arrived and I suspect they will ask it again.""(Reporting by Jessica Toonkel, Olivia Oran and Soyoung Kim in New York; Editing by Peter Henderson and Prudence Crowther)",2014-01-24,YHOO,"Fri Jan 24, 2014 | 1:17pm EST","As M&A business cools, banks warm to activist investors",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-banks-activists-idUSBREA0N1G320140124?type=companyNews
10,"  Jan 23 Goldman Sachs Group Inc may stop traders from using certain chat messaging services to protect internal conversations that are lately being subjected to intense regulatory scrutiny, the Wall Street Journal reported.As per a new policy, Goldman will not allow person-to-person instant messaging services offered by Bloomberg LP, Yahoo Inc , AOL Inc and other third-party providers including Pivot Inc, a unit of CME Group Inc, the Journal said, citing a draft of a memo. (link.reuters.com/kar36v)The move comes after Goldman, JPMorgan Chase & Co  and Deutsche Bank banned their dealers from using online chatrooms. Chatrooms have been a focus for regulators investigating possible rigging in foreign exchange market and a key interest rate known as the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, which has already cost banks billions of dollars in settlements. Traders at banks and financial institutions often communicate with each other online via third-party services including Bloomberg LP and Thomson Reuters.

14,"  * Fed to reduce stimulus by another $10 billion per month* South Africa raises rates for first time in six years* Boeing, Yahoo shares fall after results; Facebook up late* Dow down 1.2 pct; S&P 500 down 1 pct; Nasdaq off 1.1 pctBy Caroline ValetkevitchNEW YORK, Jan 29 U.S. stocks dropped more than 1 percent on Wednesday, hitting session lows after the Federal Reserve stuck with its plan to scale back stimulus even in the midst of emerging market turmoil.With the day's decline, the S&P 500 is down 4 percent for the month - its worst monthly loss since May 2012. Some investors have been bracing for a correction, given the S&P 500's gain of 30 percent last year.Trading was volatile after the Fed's move, which further reduces its monthly bond purchases by $10 billion a month. Declines were fairly broad-based, with nine of the 10 S&P 500 sector indexes ending lower. Shares of Boeing Co ranked among the biggest drags on both the Dow and the S&P 500.Overall improvement in the U.S. economy suggested the central bank would continue to cut the purchases, but some investors had speculated in recent days that the Fed might rethink its plan because of the emerging market problems.

Several companies, including Google and Microsoft, sued the government last year, seeking the ability to disclose more of that data.Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith said on Monday the latest data showed that the info the government has asked online companies to turn over has not been as vast as some feared.""We have not received the type of bulk data requests that are commonly discussed publicly regarding telephone records,"" Smith said. ""This is a point we've publicly been making in a generalized way since last summer, and it's good finally to have the ability to share concrete data.""Between 15,000 to 15,999 Microsoft-user accounts were the subject of FISA court orders requesting content during the first six months of 2013, the company said.Still, Smith cited media reports - based on Snowden's leaked documents - that the government may have intercepted user information without tech companies' knowledge or cooperation, by tapping into communications cables that link Google and Yahoo datacenters.""Despite the President's reform efforts and our ability to publish more information, there has not yet been any public commitment by either the U.S. or other governments to renounce the attempted hacking of Internet companies,"" he said on Microsoft's blog. ""We believe the Constitution requires that our government seek information from American companies within the rule of law.""BREAKDOWN  Several Internet companies had previously disclosed an approximate number of national security letters, which typically seek customer data without court approval.

Inc is shifting its main European tax base to Ireland from Switzerland, a Reuters examination of company statements and accounts shows, as pressure mounts on the Alpine nation to abolish some corporate tax incentives.The internet search group said the shift reflected a streamlining of its European operations and was not motivated by a desire to cut its tax bill, one of the higher in the U.S. tech sector.""Yahoo pays all taxes required and complies with tax laws in all countries where we operate. We take our tax obligations seriously,"" Yahoo spokeswoman Caroline Macleod-Smith said.However, tax experts said it was likely the changes that Switzerland is expected to make to its tax rules, following European Union pressure, had some influence over the decision, and that other companies could follow Yahoo's lead.""Obviously tax reasons are part of the reasons they are going out of Switzerland,"" said Frank Marty, head of tax policy at lobby group Economie Suisse.""The tax regimes we have are very successful (in attracting companies) but there is pressure that Switzerland abolishes the current regimes ...

36,"   By Denny Thomas and Paul Carsten | HONG KONG/BEIJING  HONG KONG/BEIJING Feb 25 Billionaire Jack Ma's Alibaba, the dominant force in China's $1.6 trillion e-commerce market, may already have lost a battle with rival Tencent for the world's biggest mobile market.While Alibaba Group Holding Ltd dominates in e-commerce, Tencent Holdings Ltd has taken over China's smartphone screens with its WeChat, or Weixin, social messaging platform.It's a battle that is being more closely watched after Facebook Inc's $19 billion WhatsApp buy,  and puts the spotlight on Ma's mobile strategy, especially as Alibaba winds up for a mega IPO that could value the company at close to $130 billion.The WhatsApp acquisition and that of mobile messaging firm Viber by Japan's Rakuten Inc have driven home this month how crucial mobile messaging platforms are to controlling user experience on smartphone screens.""The world's major tech companies are realizing that having a really popular mobile messenger has simply become table stake for competing in this era of computing,"" said Ted Livingston, CEO of Kik Messenger, a WhatsApp rival. ""If you want to play in mobile, you need to have a popular mobile messenger. You don't have one? You don't get to play.""Alibaba has been grappling with its mobile business in China, and its Laiwang mobile messaging app has yet to make a big impact - either as a chat app or a portal for mobile gaming. As of November, Laiwang had 10 million users, according to Alibaba. As of September, Tencent's WeChat mobile messaging app had 272 million monthly active users, booking taxis, topping up phone credit and even investing in wealth management products.Some observers say that's too big a catch-up for Alibaba.""WeChat has won China,"" said Ben Thompson, who writes about technology at stratechery.com in Taipei. ""It's going to be the dominant application there. Tencent controls the channel, the customer relationship (and) that means they can promote their services and e-commerce offerings to the exclusion and detriment of Alibaba.""Data from Chinese app store Wandoujia show that games released on WeChat rocketed to the top of their most-downloaded lists, suggesting the app's appeal goes well beyond messaging.Forrester, a consultancy, forecasts that China will have more than 500 million smartphones this year. GAME ON Ma doesn't look like he's thrown in the towel, and was widely reported as telling employees they wouldn't receive their annual bonus unless they signed up 100 new users for Laiwang. He also offered cash rewards to those who signed up the most users.Last month, Alibaba announced plans to set up a mobile gaming platform - after repeatedly saying it would not go into gaming - venturing into a fast growing sector dominated by Tencent in China. At the time, Alibaba spokesman Wang Shuai said that games developed for Laiwang would be specifically designed to compete with WeChat titles. ""We're unhappy with Tencent's monopoly in this industry,"" he wrote on Alibaba's microblog. ""We have to help to fight for a healthy environment for game development."" ""They're very aware their mobile apps are doing well from an e-commerce standpoint,"" said a Hong Kong-based M&A banker who is aware of Alibaba's strategy. ""But the way people use mobile is changing and if they don't adapt, they run the risk that WeChat is going to take some of their market share.""Alibaba has tried to push its mobile offerings to clients and users, setting up a 500 million yuan ($82 million) investment fund to give away smartphones to online merchants using Alibaba's sites. Last year, Alibaba offered up to 2 gigabytes of free mobile data to users in certain Chinese provinces if they applied for the data through Alibaba apps.When Tencent launched a ""red envelope"" feature for WeChat for Chinese New Year, letting users send traditional money gifts by smartphone, Ma called it a ""Pearl Harbour attack"" on his personal Laiwang account. Tencent said more than 8 million people used the WeChat feature.LINING UP TARGETS? Alibaba controls about 80 percent of China's e-commerce and, while there is little immediate threat that WeChat or others are making a huge dent, Tencent is gaining momentum in smartphone-based e-commerce. ""In theory, if Alibaba did nothing WeChat could completely take over mobile commerce - that's not really acceptable,"" said Marc Einstein, a Tokyo-based tech analyst at Frost & Sullivan.Alibaba is mindful of the competition, bankers said, but unlike Facebook, it's constrained by what it can buy and how it can structure deals - it already has Yahoo Inc and SoftBank Corp as big strategic shareholders.Analysts and bankers point to two potential acquisition targets for Alibaba. Naver Corp's LINE, a Japanese messenger with 350 million users that is said to be preparing for an initial public offering, and South Korea's KakaoTalk, which would seem a distant and unlikely second choice as Tencent owns a 13.84 percent stake in its owner, Kakao.""If you can't build it, buy it,"" said Frank Yu, a Beijing-based technology investment adviser and CEO of Kwestr, an online social game. ""They're going to be on a buying spree, if not already in discussions.""But Facebook's stratospheric valuation of WhatsApp - a basic messaging app rather than a broad social platform with games, finance and e-commerce - has upped the ante and is likely to make any acquisition even more costly.""The question is whether (WeChat) will drive Alibaba into doing a crazy Facebook-like deal,"" said a second person familiar with Alibaba's thinking. ""The options available to Alibaba are limited if they decide to turn aggressive on acquisitions. They can either buy LINE or bid for KakaoTalk. Those would be desperate moves.""As Tencent makes inroads into Alibaba's e-commerce turf - it this month bought 20 percent of Dianping, China's largest restaurant review and business listing site, and is reported to be in talks with online retailer JD.com to combine their e-commerce businesses - an alternative strategy for Ma may be to swallow defeat and work with Tencent, pushing Alibaba's services through WeChat.""It's a difficult and emasculating situation,"" said stratechery.com's Thompson. ""The users are on WeChat. The best Alibaba can do is accept that reality and see what it can do to co-opt it.""Alibaba and Tencent declined to comment.",2014-02-24,YHOO,"Mon Feb 24, 2014 | 4:00pm EST",What's up for Alibaba's mobile app strategy?,http://www.reuters.com//article/tech-mobile-alibaba-idUSL3N0LQ2NJ20140224?type=companyNews

44,"   By Alexei Oreskovic | SAN FRANCISCO, March 6  SAN FRANCISCO, March 6 Findery, a map-based social networking service started by the co-founder of popular photo-sharing site Flickr, launched a mobile app on Thursday.The free app, which is available for Apple Inc  iPhones, lets users leave notes, photos and videos about real-world locations on digital maps. Findery is competing in a crowded field, where many users have adopted social networking and mobile messaging services such as Facebook Inc, Snapchat and Instagram to share their personal musings and to get restaurant and movie recommendations from friends.Caterina Fake, Findery's founder and Chief Executive, is hoping there's room for a specialized service that appeals to a different set of Internet users' sensibilities. A lot of apps ""are still trying to hook you up with your friends who are going to recommend a coffee shop to you,"" said Fake. The idea of Findery, which has raised roughly $10 million in funding, is to give people a ""more meaningful"" experience by supplementing online maps with everything from personal anecdotes about a neighborhood to historical facts about a particular building. Fake has a record of creating successful online services that harness user-generated content. Fake co-founded Flickr, one of the seminal photo-sharing websites acquired by Yahoo Inc  in 2005. She is also the chairman of Etsy, an online market that specializes in crafts that some observers believe could soon be headed towards an initial public stock offering.While many online companies now espouse a ""mobile first"" strategy, Findery launched its service as a website two years ago.

45,"   By Joseph Menn | SAN FRANCISCO, March 7  SAN FRANCISCO, March 7 A few days after selling WhatsApp to Facebook for $19 billion, Jan Koum stepped into a suite at the St. Regis Hotel in San Francisco to celebrate with old friends, including CEOs, reformed hackers and a few people who fell into both those camps.Conducted over snacks and beer, the late-night festivity was a spontaneous reunion of a security super-group that had come to Koum's aid in 2000 as he grappled with a denial-of-service attack that knocked Yahoo offline when Koum was responsible for security there.The now defunct collective known as w00w00 (pronounced whoo whoo) had thrived on Internet Relay Chat channels in the late 1990s and early 2000s, between get-togethers at hacking conventions such as Def Con in Las Vegas, where a member said Koum ""came across like a big, friendly kid.""Although the elite group was not well known outside hacking circles, its members have spawned more than a dozen companies, mainly in security. The two most famous exceptions are WhatsApp, the messaging service that Koum co-founded, and Napster, the pioneering file-sharing company that was shut down by the music industry in 2001.The key to w00w00's success, according to interviews with a dozen members, was that it brought together people with widely varying expertise and backgrounds in a meritocratic way that would be tough to replicate in today's more complex and competitive world of security.Koum was already a senior Yahoo Inc executive in his early 20s when he joined w00w00. Napster Co-founder Shawn Fanning was one of several members still in high school. Both came from poor backgrounds and benefited from the group's welcoming culture, which prized collaboration in the era before computer security became a big business, let alone a major factor in national defense and offense.""Communication was democratized, and curiosity was rewarded,"" Koum told Reuters last week. ""I had so much fun in early days learning about networking, security, scalability and other geeky stuff.""The w00w00 party at the St. Regis on Feb. 26 came during the peak of the week-long RSA Conference across the street, the largest gathering of tech security professionals in the world. Some w00w00 veterans were attending the show to hawk software or services from their companies, while others were taking pains to avoid the marketing hype powered by a flood of new investment.At the reunion, most of the crew ignored the cheese and dried fruit to catch up on old times and toast the man they regard as the first real w00w00 billionaire. The Ukraine-born Koum, who wore a gray T-shirt and black sweatshirt over his large frame, made $6.8 billion from the sale of WhatsApp to Facebook Inc, according to Forbes.(Napster co-founder Sean Parker is also a billionaire, having gotten rich through owning early stock in Facebook, but he was too business-minded to spend much time in w00ww00.)The gathering was also an occasion to reflect on why the security issues that the w00w00ers worked on 15 years ago were such excellent preparation for broader technology innovation, and why that might be less true now.""You don't get cats and mice playing well together anymore, because the stakes have gotten so high and the net has become politicized,"" said Dug Song, who was a core w00w00 member. ""W00w00 was the Switzerland of computer security."" TAKEN FOR GRANTED In the 1990s, deep tech knowledge was needed to make things work. Now that infrastructure has been built out and cloud-computing resources can be rented cheaply from the likes of Amazon.com Inc, much more is taken for granted.""Young kids have less interest in security these days,"" said Ejovi Nuwere, an orphan from Brooklyn who joined w00w00 before he signed on as a security engineer at Lehman Brothers and then went on to found multiple companies. ""There's a lot more interest in starting the next Facebook than in reverse-engineering software.""Founded by Utah teenager Matt Conover, who chose the silly, exclamation-like name, w00w00 claimed about 30 core contributors at its peak, each of them invited by an existing member.Several participants had wandered to the wrong side of the law in the past. At 15, Nuwere hacked into his local Internet service provider. When he called the company and explained how he did it, he was hired at minimum wage.Another w00w00er, Anthony Zboralski, received a suspended sentence in 1997 for posing as a Paris FBI official and using the agency's network services - provided by AT&T - for free for four months.Nuwere said the group adopted a ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy, though anyone who was obviously hacking for malicious reasons was shunned. Most members of w00w00 were conducting research on their own, at small companies or ensconced in big ones like Koum.""We had some really rich and interesting discussions about security topics,"" Conover recalled. ""If someone had a good tool they wrote, they'd likely share it.""One of those tools was the Nmap Security Scanner, created by w00w00 member Gordon Lyon. Used by defenders and attackers alike, the program scans networks for open ports, available services and deployed software. Another tool was the member-developed password cracker, John the Ripper.W00w00 members regularly spoke at the top security conventions. One of them, Jeff Forristal, under the handle ""Rain Forest Puppy,"" published guidelines for responsibly disclosing flaws to software vendors before the general public.Fanning used the w00w00 crowd as beta-testers for Napster. Another w00w00 contributor, Jordan Ritter, ended up heading the development of Napster's server software before he started anti-spam service Cloudmark and other companies.Koum was already working long hours to build up Yahoo's infrastructure and automate its defenses. His big test came when a Canadian teenager launched massive denial-of-service attacks on Yahoo and others, briefly rendering most of them unreachable. Known as MafiaBoy, the teen said after his arrest that he had directed hundreds of compromised university computer networks to connect to Yahoo simultaneously, overwhelming its resources. Having never met most of the w00w00 members in person, Koum nevertheless turned to them for help in a way that would be unthinkable for a top security executive today. One of those brainstorming with him was Song, who later became the founding architect of a major denial-of-service mitigation firm, Arbor Networks Inc.ENTER THE SPIES As most of the w00w00 membership took serious jobs, often at each other's companies, the security industry as a whole was splintering.Conover and others ended up at big companies such as Symantec Corp. Some old-school hackers picked fights with several w00w00 members, arguing that information about security flaws should not be published.Increasingly during the last decade, geopolitics entered into the picture. Spy agencies and military commanders realized the immense value of specialized software for breaking into and potentially disrupting enemy networks. Some hackers who were caught breaking the law said they were offered a choice between jail and government service.The apolitical Conover said he did not like it when U.S. authorities questioned him about his associations after he returned from a conference in China.Another w00w00 mainstay, Ralph Logan, became a consultant with both corporate and U.S. government security contracts, doling out work as a ""hostel for homeless hackers.""Others sold research on how to exploit various software to brokers, who sold it to military contractors. This way of earning a living bothered some w00w00ers on a philosophical level because the information was not shared widely to help shore up cyber defenses.""The people who understand vulnerabilities and how to exploit them are being co-opted into building offensive tools for national interests,"" Nuwere said.

Ritter hired Nuwere for a non-security stealth startup called Ivy Softworks.Though security was once a major breeding ground for important new companies, such departures suggest this might not be the case for long.""The barriers for entry to learning about hacking in the old sense are such that it doesn't allow for as much free expression and open research,"" Logan said.

Unfortunately, it seems like it will take a very long time for true full reform,"" the 29-year-old Zuckerberg continued.The phone call and Zuckerberg's 300-word missive on Thursday come amid a series of revelations about controversial government surveillance practices that were leaked by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. ""The president spoke last night with Mark Zuckerberg about recent reports in the press about alleged activities by the U.S. intelligence community,"" a White House official said.The official declined further comment and referred to the National Security Agency's statement released earlier on Thursday saying recent media reports that allege the NSA has infected million of computers around the world malware and that the NSA is impersonating U.S. social media or other websites are inaccurate. Facebook, which operates the world's No. 1 Internet social network with 1.2 billion users, declined to comment beyond Zuckerberg's post.Secret documents published on news website The Intercept on Wednesday showed that the NSA impersonated Facebook web pages in order to gather information from targets. When those people thought they were logging into Facebook, they were actually communicating with the NSA. The agency then used malicious code on the fake page to break into the targets' computers and remove data from them. Last year, Facebook moved to encrypt all its pages, making such impersonation more difficult.Previous media reports based on leaked Snowden documents detail how the government may have tapped into communications cables that link data centers owned by Google Inc and Yahoo Inc, intercepting user data without the companies' knowledge or cooperation.""The US government should be the champion for the internet, not a threat.

51,"   By Jennifer Saba | March 13  March 13 Readers of some of the top U.S. news sites are more engaged when they go directly to the website rather than through Facebook, according to a study from the Pew Research Center released on Monday.The research found that users who come directly to a news site spend about three times as long per visit, or almost five minutes on average. Those who find the news by searching or through Facebook spend about two minutes.Direct visitors also view about five times as many pages per month as those coming through Facebook referrals or through search engines such as Google Inc.The study is revealing because increasingly news organizations are relying on social media platforms to distribute content especially to reach younger readers.And yet the research shows that those readers who come to an article or video through Facebook are younger and more fickle in their loyalties. The Pew study, conducted in collaboration with the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, analyzed Internet traffic from online measurement firm comScore Inc to 26 of the most popular news sites during April, May and June of 2013. They included sites owned by Yahoo Inc, AOL Inc's  Huffington Post, Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's Fox News, the New York Times Co, BuzzFeed and the BBC.The report looked at three ways people come to news articles: directly, through Facebook and through searching.The study analyzed the online reading behavior of 1 million people who use desktop or laptop computers. Data from a smaller group of readers on smartphones and mobile devices suggested a similar pattern, the authors said. ""Converting social media or search eyeballs to dedicated readers is difficult to do,"" the authors of the report wrote.""Even sites such as digital native BuzzFeed and National Public Radio's npr.org, which have an unusually high level of Facebook traffic, saw much greater engagement from those who came in directly.""Some of the sites that exhibited high levels of engagement included Foxnews.com, where the average visitor spent almost eight minutes per visit. By comparison, the average visitor to CNN spent about a minute and a half. The range of sites getting referral traffic from Facebook varied. The New York Times for instance gets 37 percent of its traffic from direct visitors and only 7 percent from Facebook.BuzzFeed receives 32 percent of its referrals directly while 50 percent are from Facebook.""Facebook and search are critical for bringing added eyeballs to individual stories, and they do so in droves,"" the authors wrote.""But the connection a news organization has with any individual coming to their website via search or Facebook is quite limited.""",2014-03-13,YHOO,"Thu Mar 13, 2014 | 12:01am EDT",U.S. news readers less engaged when referred by Facebook -study,http://www.reuters.com//article/pewstudy-news-idUSL1N0M429X20140313?type=companyNews
52,"  HONG KONG, March 15 China's e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd is planning a U.S. IPO in the third quarter of this year, people familiar  with the matter told Reuters, in what is the expected to be a more than $15 billion deal.The Hangzhou, China-based company, which controls about 80 percent of the country's e-commerce, had been in discussions with the Hong Kong stock exchange and the Securities and Futures Commission since last year about a potential listing, but the island city's regulators blocked its proposal as it violated the ""one-share-one-vote principle"".After an initial rebuff, Alibaba and the Hong Kong regulators were back at the negotiating table late last year, to find a solution to the vexed problem. While the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd has initiated a review of its listing rules to accommodate more flexible structures, any change to the existing rules would take months.Alibaba does not want to miss the technology boom, which has boosted valuations of Internet companies both in the United States and in Hong Kong. Alibaba's planned IPO would be the highest-profile Internet listing since Facebook Inc's $16 billion deal in 2012.It was not entirely clear if talks between Alibaba and the Hong Kong regulators have completely ceased, but the chances of a Hong Kong listing looks increasingly unlikely, the people added.The sources declined to be identified as the information is not public. Alibaba could file listing documents with the U.S. regulators as soon as April, one of the people said. The deal is crucial for investment banks as it is estimated it will generate $260 million in underwriting fees, Reuters previously reported.""There is no timeline, no venue selected nor have any underwriters been hired for an IPO event,"" an Alibaba spokeswoman said. 'NO CHANGE TO STRUCTURE' The listing also is closely watched by Alibaba's two largest shareholders - Yahoo Inc which owns 24 percent and Japan's Softbank Corp which controls 37 percent. Alibaba's founders and some senior managers jointly own about 13 percent of the company, which analysts estimate is worth at least $140 billion. Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley are among the two banks poised to win top underwriting mandates, while other banks are also expected to join the syndicate, the people familiar with the matter added.Alibaba's corporate structure allows a group of top partners to nominate and control the board, which is at odds with Hong Kong's stock exchange's listing rules.Joe Tsai, Alibaba's executive vice chairman told Reuters in an interview this week the company would not change its partnership structure in order to list on the Hong Kong stock exchange.""The one thing I can't understand is people think we're going to change our partnership structure just to accommodate a listing in Hong Kong, that's never going to happen,"" said Tsai.Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley did not reply to emails seeking comment.",2014-03-15,YHOO,"Sat Mar 15, 2014 | 2:18am EDT",Alibaba Group seeking US listing in Q3 - sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/alibaba-group-ipo-idUSL3N0MC04L20140315?type=companyNews

58,"  * Anti-globalisation campaigner attacks EU austerity drive* Montebourg feuded with foreign CEOs, intervened in deals* He stopped Yahoo buying French online video-sharing firm* Some believe he helps to keep support of left wing votersBy Nicholas VinocurPARIS, April 2 Leftist Arnaud Montebourg, known for attacking big business and the European Commission, reaped a political harvest on Wednesday when he was put in charge of an enlarged economy and industry ministry in a choice that may unnerve Brussels and Berlin.The anti-globalisation campaigner with film star looks was one of the winners in a shakeup that saw President Francois Hollande name former interior minister Manuel Valls as prime minister after his Socialist Party was routed in local elections.Montebourg has been the most outspoken member of Hollande's team, a champion of protectionism who has openly accused the European Union executive of strangling Europe's economy with austerity policies he says are misguided.""I think we have the chance to succeed, to succeed by pushing Europe in a new direction, because for now it is Europe that is pushing us toward austerity,"" he told France Inter radio on Tuesday. ""What we need is pragmatism and to change the ideas of the Commission.""His elevation may also be unwelcome for German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Montebourg has compared her with Otto von Bismarck, the 19th century chancellor who unified Germany with an iron fist. At the helm of the Ministry for Industrial Renewal since 2012, Montebourg has drawn fire from business leaders and some allies for his public feuds with foreign CEOs and interventions into business affairs.The 51-year-old bachelor told Lakshmi Mittal, the Indian-born chief executive of the ArcelorMittal steel group, that he was not welcome in France. Montebourg also drew much attention in international media for his exchange of acerbic letters with Texan tyre executive Maurice Taylor.He intervened last year to prevent Yahoo buying a majority stake in French online video-sharing champion Dailymotion from incumbent telecoms operator Orange, in which the state owns a 28.4 percent stake.And in a recent sortie, Montebourg openly favoured an offer by construction and telecom giant Bouygues to acquire mobile operator SFR over rival Numericable,  hours before a bid deadline was due to expire and while shares in all the firms were trading. NECESSARY NUISANCE? But despite accusations that Montebourg is a liability for the business community and an embarrassment to the government, he has consolidated his role as a champion of French industrial interests against unregulated capitalism.Author of a book advocating ""deglobalisation"", he was the best known abroad of the 35 ministers in Hollande's first government, overshadowing the more circumspect Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici, who has been dumped.He won exposure with his ""Made in France"" campaigning, modeling a blue-and-white hooped fisherman's jersey on posters to promote French-made goods. Some critics in government argue that Montebourg is a necessary nuisance, whose provocative positions help to keep the support of left-wing voters who might otherwise defect to populist parties on the far left or extreme right.When Montebourg offered to resign in 2012 after a public clash with Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault over the closure of a Mittal steel plant, Hollande turned him down. Ayrault quit on Monday after the Socialist election defeat.Montebourg's rise to prominence as a politician took a different path from that of other government ministers.A lawyer by training who won distinctions for eloquence as a student, he failed to gain admission to the elite ENA civil service school and worked his way up the ranks of the Socialist Party, winning election in his home Saone-et-Loire region.His break in national politics came in 2011 when he came a strong third in a Socialist primary for the 2012 presidential election. Hollande rewarded Montebourg for his support against conservative Nicolas Sarkozy by giving him the industry portfolio, a difficult task due to factory closures and heavy blue-collar job losses.In his first months in the job, Montebourg repeatedly sided with trade unions against chief executives over the closures of a Peugeot factory near Paris and blast furnaces operated by ArcelorMittal in eastern France.In both cases Montebourg attacked the bosses in public and ended up losing his fight while suffering criticism.His latest action against Numericable - whose Franco-Israeli chief executive he criticised for paying his taxes in Switzerland - hints at a change in strategy from siding with unions to picking corporate champions.

63,"  (Corrects date in dateline)* Read this story in a PDF link.reuters.com/duf38v* Grandson of former China president rising private equity star* Investors believe Alvin Jiang is a gateway to lucrative deals* Alvin's Boyu Capital purchased Sunrise Duty Free in state-controlled sector* Boyu now sitting on a paper gain of 4 times its investment in SunriseBy Stephen Aldred and Irene Jay LiuHONG KONG, April 10 The 28-year-old wears black-framed glasses perched on cheeks still round with youth. A discerning eye might notice the resemblance to his grandfather: former Chinese president and Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin.Alvin Jiang has a knack for landing lucrative deals in China, the world's biggest emerging market for private equity. He is a founding partner at Hong Kong-based Boyu Capital, now one of the hottest firms in China. Boyu has attracted high-profile investors such as Asia's richest man, Li Ka-shing, and Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, Temasek Holdings Private Limited.Founded in 2010, Boyu Capital is poised to earn big paydays from two of the most notable initial public offerings to emerge from China in the last 18 months - e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd IPO-ALIB.N, and state-backed debt trader China Cinda Asset Management Co. No other China-focused firm with such a short history has found its way into both deals.Boyu is regarded as among the most professional operators in China private equity, with seasoned executives at its helm. But according to multiple investors, Alibaba and Cinda are not only what lures them to Boyu.Investors were also impressed with Boyu's 2011 purchase of a controlling stake in Sunrise Duty Free - which runs all the duty-free stores at Shanghai and Beijing's international airports. That deal, they believe, provided evidence that Jiang Zemin's grandson could gain access to a strictly controlled state sector and convert those assets into a highly profitable investment.The Sunrise investment is expected to earn a substantial exit payout for Jiang, his Boyu colleagues and investors in the firm's first $1 billion fund, people in the private equity industry say.Whether the young private equity executive actually uses his personal connections in the way investors attribute to him remains unclear. There is no evidence that Jiang Zemin had a role in helping Boyu win a part in the Sunrise deal or in any other transaction. That hasn't stopped the belief from spreading that Alvin Jiang is tapping his family connections.Alvin Jiang and Boyu Capital declined to comment for this story.PRINCELING INFLUENCE Alvin Jiang's Chinese given name is Zhicheng, which means, ""with ambition, you can achieve."" He is a ""princeling,"" the relatives of current or former senior Chinese Communist Party leaders. His father, Jiang Mianheng, is also a princeling. He is the CEO of one of Shanghai's largest state-owned enterprises and is in charge of China's push into alternative nuclear energy sources.The extensive control of China's Communist Party over almost all aspects of China's economy and society has often allowed princelings to leverage their political connections to amass wealth. Conflict of interest laws in China are weak and coverage of the business dealings of the political elite is heavily censored in the largely state-controlled media.Princelings have played central roles in businesses involved in finance, energy, domestic security, telecommunications and the media. Private equity, featuring deals that are often by their nature opaque, has proven to be a natural haven for them.Within China's private equity realm, 15 firms identified by Reuters were either founded by a princeling, or have employed princelings in senior roles. Between them, these funds have raised at least $17.5 billion for investment since 1999.The most powerful investors in private equity funds, known as limited partners, include giant U.S. pension funds and insurance companies; sovereign wealth funds; university endowments; and ultra-high net worth individuals. For some of these big investors, the China game is straightforward: ""You just have to know the right people,"" said one veteran limited partner. ""It's why you invest with a princeling fund.""Several limited partners told Reuters that their firms assess princelings on their political connections and ability to convert those ties into business deals.Alvin Jiang and Boyu Capital, these investors say, rank high on those lists.AN OUTSTANDING RETURN In mid-2011, Boyu agreed to pay around $80 million for a 40 percent stake in Sunrise Duty Free, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the deal, valuing Sunrise at $200 million. The ownership of the remaining 60 per cent of Sunrise has not been made public. Boyu, however, has told investors it has a controlling stake, sources with knowledge of the matter said.At the time of Boyu's investment, Sunrise ranked 15th among the top 25 travel retailers in the world, with annual revenue of around $670 million, according to the Moodie Report, which tracks the duty free industry.By early 2013, Boyu had marked the Sunrise business on its books at a value of around $800 million, two of the sources with direct knowledge of the valuation said. Bankers, however, value Sunrise at twice that amount - at around $1.6 billion - based on 2012 sales figures the company filed with Chinese authorities, which Reuters reviewed.Based on Boyu's more conservative valuation of $800 million for Sunrise, Boyu could be sitting on a paper gain of around four times its money in just under three years - an outstanding return in an industry where earning a multiple of two times over five years is considered a success. Boyu has already recovered much of its Sunrise investment through dividend payments, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.BEHOLD THE SUNRISE The man who founded, built and then sold Sunrise to Boyu is Fred Kiang, a Chinese-American businessman with close ties to the Jiang family, according to Alvin Jiang's friends and business associates.Kiang founded Sunrise in 1999. That was the year the central government under Jiang Zemin opened up the operation of duty free shops to international bidders at the new Pudong International Airport in Shanghai - Jiang's political power base.Previously, duty free operations had been a monopoly controlled by state-owned China Duty Free, and foreign firms like Kiang's were excluded from the business.Three international companies were selected to operate at Pudong airport, including two established duty free firms: World Duty Free, owned at the time by the British Airport Authority, and Orient King Power, a subsidiary of Hong Kong's King Power Group. The third tender went to Kiang's newly formed Sunrise Duty Free, a foreign-owned company with no previous experience in the industry.Sunrise won a 10-year contract to sell tobacco and alcohol at Shanghai's Pudong Airport, World Duty Free won a five-year contract to sell perfume and cosmetics, and Orient King Power won the concession to sell luxury goods.SPECIAL APPROVAL  In 2000, China's State Council approved a measure that handed control of all duty free businesses - except those in Shanghai - from local governments to state-owned China Duty Free. Foreign companies were banned from setting up joint ventures or directly owning duty free businesses in China.Yet in 2001 Sunrise Duty Free took over the perfume and cosmetics duty free concession at Pudong airport when World Duty Free pulled out of its contract. Published reports at the time quoted World Duty Free as calling it a ""strategic withdrawal"" because passenger traffic had not reached forecast levels. Sunrise in time would also take over luxury goods at the airport.In 2005, Sunrise won a 10-year concession at Beijing International Airport, outbidding China Duty Free and Orient King Power. In 2009, its contract at Pudong was renewed for another decade.Sunrise was granted ""special approval"" to operate duty free shops by China's cabinet, the State Council, despite restrictions against foreign ownership, according to a 2009 report by China Business News, a state-owned media outlet. No other details were given on the Sunrise exemption.Today, business at Sunrise is booming. According to the company documents seen by Reuters, Sunrise had revenue of $1.08 billion in 2012. The Moodie Report ranks Sunrise just behind state-owned China Duty Free, which controls nearly all of China's other duty free shops.KIANG AND THE JIANGS Why Fred Kiang would sell 40 per cent of a thriving company at what appears to be a discount remains the central puzzle surrounding the Sunrise deal. Apart from Sunrise, Kiang's mainland business remains unknown. Friends and associates note his taste in expensive cigars, and the little publicity he has received is largely devoted to that passion. In 2009, he hosted an event in Shanghai to smoke the 40th anniversary Cohiba Behike, a limited edition Cuban cigar that sold for $500 apiece.Kiang, who is in his late 60s, shuttles between Shanghai, Hong Kong and Tucson, Arizona, where he owns properties in areas ranging from gated communities to low-end rentals. Alvin Jiang and Jiang Mianheng have used a Kiang residence address in Arizona for small personal business transactions.Kiang declined to respond to e-mails and phone calls from Reuters.Born in China, Kiang claims Shanghai roots, but was raised in the United States. He received his undergraduate and MBA degrees at Massachusetts' Babson College in 1970 and 1975, respectively, and now sits on the college's board of trustees.Kiang first met Jiang Zemin in 1986, when Kiang served as vice-chairman of the San Francisco-Shanghai Sister City Committee, led by then city mayor and now U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, according to a person close to Kiang. Kiang and Jiang noted their common surname, which though spelled differently in English, is the same character in Chinese, said the source who is Alvin's friend and business acquaintance.In 1989, Jiang Zemin became Communist Party General Secretary; in 1990 Kiang established his base in Shanghai. Kiang was a senior executive at Newbridge, the former name of TPG Capital in Asia, one of the world's biggest private equity firms, three people with direct knowledge told Reuters. From the late 1990s to the 2000s, Kiang was an advisor to U.S.-based insurer MetLife Inc as it looked for a joint venture partner to build its business in China, said a source with knowledge of the matter. Kiang negotiated on MetLife's first mainland license in 2004, the source said, one of the first major Sino-foreign ventures created after China's 2001 entry into the World Trade Organization.TPG and MetLife declined to comment.BOYU'S RISE In 2010, Alvin Jiang, newly graduated from Harvard with a bachelor's degree, was just another newbie banker in Hong Kong, working as an analyst at Goldman Sachs private equity unit. Nine months later, he left to launch Boyu. On September 21, 2010, he filed incorporation documents in Hong Kong, listing himself as the company's sole director.When Boyu first made news in 2011, it was private equity veteran Mary Ma whose name captured headlines, not Alvin's.Ma, the former CFO at Lenovo Group, left a senior role at TPG to help set up Boyu. Additional co-founders soon followed: Louis Cheung, former executive director of Ping An Insurance Group of China, credited with its turnaround from 2000; and Sean Tong, a veteran of U.S. private equity firms Providence Equity Partners and General Atlantic, where he was Alvin Jiang's boss during a summer internship in 2008.Ma and Cheung were known in the private equity industry for turning around struggling companies; Tong was a noted dealmaker. Combined, they had 50 years of industry experience.DILIGENT AND FOCUSED Two subsequent investments cemented Boyu's reputation for having the influence to find its way into profitable, high-profile assets. Alvin Jiang played a role negotiating both deals.In 2012, Alibaba founder Jack Ma found himself face-to-face with Jiang Zemin's grandson. Boyu had joined a consortium led by China Investment Corp (CIC) to raise some of the $7.1 billion that Ma needed to buy back half of Yahoo! Inc's  40 percent stake in Alibaba. Some high profile departures had left CIC, China's giant sovereign wealth fund, short of personnel. That left it up to Boyu to lead the negotiations, with Alvin on Sean Tong's team, according to two sources directly involved in the negotiations.Alibaba and CIC declined to comment.The CIC consortium received a 5.6 percent stake in Alibaba in exchange for raising capital to help buy half of Yahoo!'s shares in China's giant e-commerce company. Alibaba was valued at around $38 billion then.Analysts estimate Alibaba is worth at least $140 billion today, which means Boyu's investment as part of the CIC consortium has increased more than three and a half times in value in 18 months. The e-commerce giant has announced it will list shares on one of the New York exchanges in the third quarter of this year, a deal expected to exceed Facebook's  $16 billion offering in 2012.Alvin Jiang also brought in Boyu to invest around $50 million in Cinda, created in 1999 to buy bad debts from state-owned banks, said two sources familiar with the deal. Banks and private equity firms were jockeying to get a piece of the $1.6 billion stake that Cinda was offering to strategic investors ahead of its initial public offering.The consortium of investors that were allowed to make a pre-IPO investment in Cinda included China's social security fund NSSF, UBS AG, CITIC Capital, Standard Chartered Bank - and two private equity funds, the powerhouse Carlyle Group and Boyu Capital.Some of Jiang's friends stress he is more than just a well-connected face. He works through a company's numbers when negotiating, a skill he picked up during his brief time at Goldman, said one friend and business acquaintance. ""Many people from his background would not bother to do that,"" the friend said.""HEADLINE RISK"" Princeling privilege isn't necessarily permanent in China, even for the grandson of a living former President. The extraordinary fall of former Chongqing governor Bo Xilai in 2012 reinforced that notion for many private equity investors.Because they work for companies governed by Western laws, some have turned cautious about investing in princeling firms. In private, investors discuss ""headline risk,"" the fear that a business deal will end up on the front pages of newspapers.Those worries have risen with President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's investigation into Wall Street's hiring practices in China.""Our firm is pretty equally divided on investing with princelings,"" said one European investor. ""I oppose it, but many of my colleagues are for it. I see princeling funds as a double-edged sword.""For Boyu, profit and prospects have so far trumped any such anxiety: Alvin Jiang's firm has swiftly raised $1.5 billion from investors for its second fund, 50 per cent more than its first fund, people with knowledge of the matter said.

64,"  (Adds Breakingviews link)By Alexei OreskovicSAN FRANCISCO, April 15 Yahoo Inc  barely managed to expand its core advertising business in the first quarter despite Chief Executive Marissa Mayer's two-year effort to revive growth at the Internet pioneer.Mayer told analysts on a Tuesday conference call she believed the company had been through the worst and had now entered a period of stable but modest growth.Yahoo expects second quarter revenue, excluding traffic acquisition costs, of $1.06 billion to $1.1 billion, in line with Wall Street's expectations for about $1.08 billion.Still, Yahoo's shares leaped 8 percent on strong results from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, the Chinese e-commerce company in which it owns a 24 percent stake, ahead of its highly anticipated initial public offering. Mayer is trying to revitalize Yahoo's business. The former Google Inc  executive revamped many of Yahoo's Web products but its ad sales business continues to struggle, while rivals such as Google, Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc  post strong revenue growth.Revenue from display ads, which account for roughly 40 percent of Yahoo's overall sales, increased just 2 percent year-on-year to $453 million, excluding partner fees. That meager growth follows several consecutive quarters of decline in the display ad business. Shares of Yahoo were up at $36.90 in after hours trading.""It's really Alibaba driving things,"" said Macquarie Research analyst Ben Schachter. Yahoo's core business improved slightly in the first quarter, but ""really the story here is Alibaba and the somewhat unexpected re-acceleration"" of its revenue growth. The Chinese company's revenue increased 66 percent to $3.06 billion in the fourth quarter, according to slides that Yahoo posted on its investor relations website on Tuesday,  faster than the 51 percent growth in Alibaba's third quarter.Yahoo reports the Chinese company's financial results one quarter later than its own.Alibaba, valued at more than $140 billion, is expected to go public later this year in the United States in the largest IPO since Facebook Inc's debut in 2012.Yahoo's revenue, excluding fees paid to partner websites, came to $1.087 billion in the first quarter, up from $1.074 billion in the year-ago period. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S had expected adjusted revenue of $1.077 billion.It had net income of $311.6 million, or 29 cents a share, in the first quarter. It earned 38 cents a share excluding certain items.

67,"   By Edwin Chan | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Alibaba Group Holding Ltd accelerated revenue growth in the crucial fourth quarter, the company reported on Tuesday, a timely lift for the Chinese Internet company as it prepares for a highly anticipated public offering.Alibaba's resurgence helped lift shares in Yahoo Inc, which owns about 24 percent of the Chinese company and is highly sensitive to Alibaba's growth prospects and valuation.The U.S. company's stock was up 8 percent at $36.90 after hours despite reporting anemic quarterly revenue and display advertising growth in its own business.China's largest Internet company, which is racing to prepare for the largest U.S. IPO since Facebook Inc's 2012 coming-out party, recorded 66 percent growth in sales to $3.06 billion in 2013's final three months. Its listing is the most highly anticipated of what's expected to be a record year for U.S. tech debuts, spurred on by Twitter Inc's successful 2013 IPO. However, Alibaba had experienced several quarters of slowing growth as its torrid pace of expansion cooled. It posted its slowest rate of growth in three quarters during the July-to-September period.On Tuesday, the company that powers four-fifths of all Chinese online consumer shopping recorded a doubling in net income to $1.36 billion.Its results were released alongside Yahoo's first-quarter numbers. Executives with the U.S. company told analysts on a conference call they would not comment further on Alibaba's numbers, given that the Chinese company has entered a pre-IPO quiet period. RAGS TO RICHES Alibaba, founded 15 years ago by outspoken English schoolteacher Jack Ma, has cornered the Chinese consumer market and expanded into everything from online auctions to messaging and payments. An IPO could arm the company as it tries also to dominate the nascent mobile shopping and social media arenas. Market participants expect it to raise as much as $16 billion this year.Tencent Holdings Ltd has the upper hand in mobile services, including in areas like messaging and games, the most important battleground for the country's Internet companies.In addition, Alibaba's strategy of building a global e-commerce empire with its own financial services is attracting close scrutiny from China's regulators and resistance from the country's banks.(Reporting by Edwin Chan; Editing by James Dalgleish and Jonathan Oatis)",2014-04-15,YHOO,"Tue Apr 15, 2014 | 5:53pm EDT",Alibaba's growth quickens in time for landmark U.S. IPO,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-alibaba-results-idUSBREA3E1VJ20140415?type=companyNews

Readings below 50 mean more builders view market conditions as poor than favorable.European stocks were held back by the worries over the escalating tensions in Ukraine and weak results by bellwethers including Nestle. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares closed down 0.96 percent at 1,306.85 and kept a damper on a measure of global equity activity. Dow components Coke and J&J rose after reporting quarterly results, while names in the Internet and biotech space fell, a sign investors were rotating from growth into value stocks. High-growth stocks have been under pressure in recent weeks after their sharp rise in prices took valuations to levels considered unsustainable.The Nasdaq Biotech index rebounded 0.9 percent after earlier trading down more than 3.5 percent.""The market is trying to stabilize, and investors are looking for high-quality names that have stability in their earnings and prices,"" said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland. ""This afternoon's move is part of that same flight to quality.""Russia declared Ukraine on the brink of civil war as Kiev said an ""anti-terrorist operation"" against pro-Moscow separatists was under way, with troops and armored personnel carriers seen near a flashpoint eastern town.""We're cautious in the short term, we're waiting to see how the geopolitical situation evolves. There are a lot of uncertainties about Ukraine, which could become a negative catalyst for stocks if things spin out of control,"" said Barclays France director Franklin Pichard. MSCI's all-country world stock index traded flat after Wall Street's close.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 89.32 points, or 0.55 percent, to 16,262.56, the S&P 500 gained 12.37 points, or 0.68 percent, to 1,842.98, and the Nasdaq Composite  added 11.467 points, or 0.29 percent, to 4,034.161.After the closing bell, Intel Corp shares rose 3 percent to $27.56 after the chipmaker reported first-quarter results and gave an outlook.Yahoo Inc shares jumped 8 percent in after-hours trade, to $36.90. The company reported only a slight rise in its core advertising business in the first quarter, but the shares jumped on strong results from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, the Chinese e-commerce company in which Yahoo holds a 24 percent stake.Over all, corporate results have been weak so far. Of the 36 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings to date for the first quarter, only 52.8 percent have topped analyst expectations. In a typical quarter over the past two decades, 62 percent of companies beat estimates. U.S. Treasuries prices gained as the rising tensions in Ukraine sparked a safety bid.Benchmark 10-year notes were up 3/32 in price to yield 2.6301 percent.The dollar rose slightly against the euro in late trade. The euro recovered against the dollar on Monday after the European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, indicated over the weekend that the central bank would act to prevent deflation in the euro zone.The dollar edged higher against the euro, up 0.04 percent at $1.3813.The dollar was up 0.11 percent against the Japanese yen  at 101.93, and was up 0.06 percent against the Swiss franc, at 0.8801 franc.The U.S. dollar index was last up 0.08 percent.Benchmark Brent oil rose slightly after news that Ukrainian armed forces launched military operations in the east of the country, though gains were limited by the prospect of a resumption of oil exports from Libya.U.S. crude futures fell 30 cents to settle at $103.75. The June contract for Brent, which will become the front-month contract on Wednesday, settled 29 cents higher at $109.36 a barrel.(Reporting by Herbert Lash; Additional reporting by Jamie McGeever in London; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Leslie Adler)",2014-04-15,YHOO,"Tue Apr 15, 2014 | 5:27pm EDT","GLOBAL MARKETS-Ukraine worries weigh on global shares, drive up bonds",http://www.reuters.com//article/markets-global-idUSL2N0N71R820140415?type=companyNews

Johnson & Johnson rose 2.1 percent to $99.20 after the pharmaceuticals and consumer products company posted earnings that beat expectations and raised its full-year profit view.Among the most active ""momentum"" names, shares of electric car maker Tesla Motors Inc fell 2.1 percent to $193.91 and shares of online movie rental company Netflix Inc  dropped 1.6 percent to $326.27.

76,"   By Ryan Vlastelica | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Stocks rose 1 percent on Wednesday, advancing for a third straight session as Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen reaffirmed the central bank's commitment to keeping interest rates low and Yahoo rallied.Data showing Chinese economic growth exceeded expectations and U.S. industrial production rose for a second straight month also improved sentiment, though Bank of America (BAC.N) and CSX Corp CSX.N sold off following their results.Yellen, speaking in New York, reaffirmed the Fed's commitment to keep interest rates low, even after ending its bond-buying program, as long as inflation remains below target and unemployment elevated. The Fed's Beige Book, a report of anecdotal information on business activity, showed that activity picked up in most regions in recent weeks.""These comments, while nothing out of the ordinary, reiterated the Fed's commitment to accommodative monetary policy, which is helping investors remember that there are more tailwinds than headwinds in the economy,"" said Kristina Hooper, head of U.S. capital markets research and strategy at Allianz Global Investors in New York.Yahoo (YHOO.O) was the S&P 500's biggest gainer, rising 6.3 percent to $36.35.

IBM (IBM.N) shares fell 1.5 percent after the bell following the release of the Dow component's earnings.

U.S. manufacturing output rose for a second straight month in March in a sign of recovery from a harsh and prolonged winter that had put a damper on activity.The global economy should grow steadily at best over the coming year, a Reuters poll showed, but any rapid slowdown in China could upset the progress. The market has bounced back from last week's pummeling, when the S&P 500 posted its largest weekly decline since mid-2012.

Fed Chair Janet Yellen told the Economic Club of New York that the U.S. economy appeared to be slowly moving toward full employment, but that it would need help from the central bank for some time to come.      Yellen said that achieving the Fed's economic goals ""will likely require low real interest rates for some time,"" a policy view she said was shared broadly across many advanced economies.     Wall Street rallied for a third straight day, and the three major stock gauges climbed 1 percent or more.     China's economy grew 7.4 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, topping forecasts of 7.3 percent. There had been speculation that growth would be closer to 7 percent after a string of recent soft numbers.         Relief rippled through Asian markets, then spread to Europe and Wall Street. Japan's Nikkei ended up 3 percent, its biggest gain since February.      MSCI's all-country world index rose 1.02 percent, while the FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading European shares closed up 1.2 percent at 1,322.51 points. Yet many traders pegged the gain as a technical rebound after a 1 percent decline in the previous session.      Earlier this month, the European index hit a near six-year high, a rally that has been halted by worries over the crisis in Ukraine as well as worries about China, the world's second biggest economy.     ""There is a lot of concern about Chinese growth this year, so there is some relief in the GDP number,"" said Jim Russell, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Cincinnati. ""We think that is influencing the market today.""     On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 162.29 points, or 1 percent, to 16,424.85. The S&P 500  gained 19.33 points, or 1.05 percent, to 1,862.31, and the Nasdaq Composite added 52.064 points, or 1.29 percent, to 4,086.225.     Yahoo was the leading percentage gainer on the S&P 500 as investors focused on the company's 24 percent stake in Chinese internet company Alibaba Group Holding Inc IPO-ALIB.N, which reported a surge in quarterly revenue growth in the last quarter of 2013. Yahoo shares jumped 6.26 percent to $36.35.        Google Inc , after the market close, reported its Internet business revenue grew 19 percent in the first quarter, falling short of Wall Street targets as the price of its online ads continued to decline.     Shares of Google were down 5.8 percent at $524.40 in after-hours trading.      International Business Machines Corp reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue as weakness in its storage and server businesses continued to offset gains in its software services. IBM shares fell about 4 percent to $188.40 in after-hours trade.     In U.S. economic news, industrial production rose at a faster-than-expected clip in March, the latest sign the economy was gaining momentum.

The Fed's Beige Book, a report of anecdotal information on business activity, showed that activity picked up in most regions in recent weeks. ""These comments, while nothing out of the ordinary, reiterated the Fed's commitment to accommodative monetary policy, which is helping investors remember that there are more tailwinds than headwinds in the economy,"" said Kristina Hooper, head of U.S. capital markets research and strategy at Allianz Global Investors in New York.Yahoo was the S&P 500's biggest gainer, rising 6.3 percent to $36.35. While the company gave a tepid revenue outlook, revenue growth accelerated in the last quarter of 2013 for Alibaba IPO-ALIB.N, in which Yahoo holds a 24 percent stake.Intel shares briefly hit their highest since June 2012 a day after the chipmaker posted a quarterly net profit that exceeded Wall Street's estimates. The stock rose 0.6 percent to end at $26.93.On the downside, Bank of America Corp slid 1.6 percent to $16.13 after the bank swung to a quarterly loss. CSX Corp fell 1.8 percent to $27.79 after its results. ""We don't expect a great earnings season, given the negative impact of weather in the first quarter, but investors with a long enough timeline should be able to look past that,"" said Hooper, who helps oversee $475 billion in assets.After the closing bell, Google Inc reported its quarterly results and its stock tumbled 4.9 percent to $536. IBM  shares fell 1.5 percent after the bell following the release of the Dow component's earnings. The shares of American Express Co, another Dow component, fell 0.9 percent in extended-hours trading after the world's biggest credit card issuer reported its first-quarter earnings.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 162.29 points, or 1.00 percent, to end at 16,424.85.

In the latest economic data, China reported that its economy grew at its slowest pace in 18 months at the start of 2014, but the increase was better than expected and showed some improvement in March. U.S. manufacturing output rose for a second straight month in March in a sign of recovery from a harsh and prolonged winter that had put a damper on activity.The global economy should grow steadily at best over the coming year, a Reuters poll showed, but any rapid slowdown in China could upset the progress.The market has bounced back from last week's pummeling, when the S&P 500 posted its largest weekly decline since mid-2012. This week, the major U.S. stock indexes climbed after results from Citigroup Inc and Coca-Cola Co, and as biotechnology shares rebounded.Recent trading has been volatile. On Tuesday, the Nasdaq opened higher, then turned sharply negative before rallying in the afternoon to end higher. According to Bespoke Investment Group, this kind of action has only happened 18 times since 2000, and a week following each instance, ""the Nasdaq has averaged a decline of 2.84 percent,"" the firm wrote to clients.While only 9 percent of S&P 500 companies have reported results so far, 57.4 percent have topped earnings expectations, below the long-term average of 62 percent.

81,"   By Alexei Oreskovic | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) again posted anemic quarterly revenue growth as the Internet company's advertising business continues to lag its rivals, nearly two years into Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer's comeback effort.Mayer told analysts on Tuesday that new mobile and advertising initiatives were gaining momentum, positioning the company for a period of stable but modest growth. Revenue from its core display advertising business inched 2 percent higher in the first quarter, reversing several consecutive quarters of declines.But the company forecast second-quarter revenue, excluding fees paid to partner websites, of $1.06 billion to $1.1 billion. That suggests revenue could decline by as much as 1 percent or rise by up to 2.7 percent from $1.07 billion a year earlier, underscoring the challenges facing its business.That did not faze Wall Street, which is focused primarily on Yahoo's 24 percent stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd IPO-ALIB.N, the Chinese e-commerce giant that is expected to go public later this year.Yahoo's shares climbed 7 percent on strong results from Alibaba.""It's really Alibaba driving things,"" said Macquarie Research analyst Ben Schachter. Yahoo's core business improved slightly in the first quarter, but ""really the story here is Alibaba and the somewhat unexpected re-acceleration"" of its revenue growth. The Chinese company's revenue increased 66 percent to $3.06 billion in the fourth quarter, according to slides that Yahoo posted on its investor relations website on Tuesday, faster than the 51 percent growth in Alibaba's third quarter.Yahoo reports the Chinese company's financial results one quarter later than its own.CHEAPER ADS PROLIFERATE Mayer is trying to revitalize Yahoo's business. The former Google Inc (GOOGL.O) executive revamped many of Yahoo's Web products but its ad sales business continues to struggle while rivals such as Google, Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) continue to post strong, double-digit revenue growth. Revenue from display ads, which accounts for roughly 40 percent of Yahoo's overall sales, increased just 2 percent to $409 million, excluding partner fees. That meager growth follows several consecutive quarters of decline in the display ad business.Yahoo said it was making progress in developing new mobile technology, online video, social media and new ad formats. The company now counts 430 million monthly users of its mobile products, while the number of online video streams consumers watched increased 30 percent from the fourth quarter.Finance chief Ken Goldman said that so-called ""stream ads"" that appear in-between scrolling news headlines on Yahoo's Web pages now account for about a fifth of the number of display ads that the company serves. He noted that stream ads were priced lower, weighing on the company's total average price per display ad, which declined 5 percent. Goldman did not provide any update on how Yahoo might use the proceeds from the Alibaba IPO, during which Yahoo is required to sell 40 percent of its stake in the company.Alibaba, valued at more than $140 billion, is expected to go public later this year in the United States in the largest IPO since Facebook's debut in 2012.Yahoo's revenue, excluding fees paid to partner websites, came to $1.087 billion in the first quarter, up from $1.074 billion in the year-ago period. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S had expected adjusted revenue of $1.077 billion.It had net income of $311.6 million, or 29 cents a share, in the first quarter. It earned 38 cents a share excluding certain items.(This story has been fixed to correct the display revenue number to $409 million from $453 million, in 10th paragraph)(Reporting by Alexei Oreskovic; Editing by Alden Bentley and Richard Chang)",2014-04-16,YHOO,"Wed Apr 16, 2014 | 11:13am EDT",Yahoo's growth anemic as turnaround chugs along,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-yahoo-results-quarterly-idUSBREA3F16220140416?type=companyNews
82,"   By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed  Yahoo Inc's shares rose as much as 9 percent in heavy trading on Wednesday, a day after Chinese internet company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, in which it holds a 24 percent stake, reported a surge in quarterly revenue.At least nine brokerages raised their price targets on Yahoo's shares ahead of Alibaba's IPO filing, expected next week.The share, up 5.5 percent at $36.10 in early trading, was the most heavily traded stock on the Nasdaq.""We continue to recommend aggressive purchase of (Yahoo's) shares ahead of the Alibaba IPO,"" Topeka Capital Markets analyst Victor Anthony said in a note.Alibaba, which reported a 66 percent rise in fourth-quarter revenue, is expected to file prospectus for the share sale as early as Monday, sources said. The IPO is set to be the largest in the United States since Facebook Inc's 2012 market debut and it is the most awaited IPO in what's expected to be a record year for U.S. tech debuts after Twitter Inc's successful IPO in 2013.Alibaba's impressive performance overshadowed Yahoo's anemic revenue growth in the first quarter.Analysts, however, were positive on growth in Yahoo's core display and search advertisement revenue as the company invests in mobile, social, video and native advertisement products. Yahoo's display ad revenue grew for the first time in more than a year, while search revenue rose for the ninth straight quarter.Speculation about the valuation of Alibaba has reached a fever pitch, with some brokerages pegging it as high as $190 billion. This sets Yahoo up for a huge windfall when it eventually sells its Alibaba stake. ""The potential prospects of an Alibaba IPO are the chief motivation for our buy recommendation, but our positive view on shares is also supported by our increasing confidence in the core YHOO operation,"" CRT Capital analyst Neil Doshi said.Yahoo could benefit if it is able to liquidate its Alibaba stake in a tax-efficient manner, Wells Fargo analyst Peter Stabler said.Wells Fargo raised its rating on Yahoo's stock to ""outperform"" from ""market perform.""Yahoo's shares have jumped about 50 percent in the past year as CEO Marissa Mayer pushes ahead with her turnaround plan.(Additional reporting by Soham Chatterjee; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Kirti Pandey)",2014-04-16,YHOO,"Wed Apr 16, 2014 | 10:52am EDT",Yahoo shares jump as Alibaba's revenue surges ahead of IPO,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-yahoo-results-idUSBREA3E1TH20140416?type=companyNews

85,"  Yahoo Inc's Chief Executive Marissa Mayer is working on a plan to persuade Apple Inc to ditch Google as its default search engine in favor of Yahoo, technology news site Re/code reported, citing sources within Yahoo.Mayer's effort is in advanced stages, with a detailed pitch already prepared for Apple executives, the website said. (link.reuters.com/hez58v)Yahoo senior vice president of mobile and emerging products, Adam Cahan, is working on the effort too.Mayer, a former Google executive, has managed to get support from some Apple executives, including longtime acquaintance Jonathan Ive, according to the Apple Insider blog. ""Mayer has supposedly wrangled support from a few Apple execs including longtime acquaintance Jony Ive,"" Apple Insider said.

88,"   By Elzio Barreto | HONG KONG, April 30  HONG KONG, April 30 As Alibaba.com prepared for its Hong Kong IPO in late 2007, details of the deal emerged in local media, much to the frustration of Michael Yao, the company's top financial adviser.Yao, then at Rothschild, summoned bankers and others working on the deal to a meeting to remind them of the confidentiality agreements they had signed. ""He read the riot act to everyone there,"" said a person who was at that meeting, telling them: ""If anyone does anything, I'll make sure to find out.""""He's very soft spoken and easy going, but would act like el capo (boss) sometimes, putting the bankers in order,"" the person added.Seven years on, Yao is now guiding China's e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd IPO-ALIB.N through a planned U.S. listing, expected to top Facebook Inc's $16 billion IPO as the biggest technology listing.The big change for Yao is that he is now leading from inside, having left Rothschild to join Alibaba.Otherwise, there's a sense of deja vu. Yao is again closely guarding the IPO process, keeping a tight control of an issue that could pay out an estimated $225 million in a bumper fee day for underwriters working on the deal.At a March 25 meeting in Hong Kong, led by Yao, Alibaba kept most details secret until an hour before the scheduled event - to keep prying media at bay and avoid regulatory scrutiny from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Some of those invited were driven to the venue without being told where they were going. Others arrived at the exclusive Aberdeen Marina Club in the south of Hong Kong's island to assemble in a room booked under a secret name, to avoid linking it to Alibaba, said people who were at the meeting.""When all that becomes so public ... the company is forced to take all sorts of measures to try and avoid accidentally tripping any regulatory or legal issues,"" said a person familiar with the IPO process. ""It's not so much that the company is so secretive, it's just really more about U.S. regulations and legal issues than anything else.""DELICATE JOB  Yao, a Chinese-American and Wharton School graduate, was hired by Alibaba in late 2012 as senior vice president, heading the corporate finance division, and was tasked with planning what has become the most anticipated IPO since Facebook.A keen skier who spends downtime on the slopes at Whistler in Canada or Hokkaido in Japan, Yao has a close relationship with Joe Tsai, Alibaba's former chief financial officer and a co-founder of the company with Jack Ma.Tsai is the IPO's architect, Yao its deliverer - delicately navigating the process to avoid the missteps taken by Facebook, whose shares tumbled more than a third in their first month of trading, triggering legal suits and compensation payouts.""He's a well-rounded guy who has a lot of experience with IPOs and equity capital markets from all sides - from the issuer side and from the bank side,"" said Philippe Espinasse, a former UBS and Nomura investment banker in Hong Kong who worked with Yao on MTR Corp's $1.4 billion IPO in 2000 and other deals.""Not only has he worked on the investment banking side, structuring and selling deals, but at Rothschild he was also involved on the other side of the table, working on the corporate side and dealing with the bankers."" NO BIG EGO Some of those who have worked with Yao say he is level-headed, and doesn't hesitate to roll up his sleeves. While he is easy going and not ego-driven, he can be very firm, though not in a confrontational way, they added.He is also well-connected in Hong Kong after a long banking career in the city and through family ties. His wife is the granddaughter of the late Tung Chao Yung, founder of Orient Overseas Container Line (OOCL), one of the world's largest container transport and logistics companies. Her uncle is Tung Chee-hwa, Hong Kong's first head of government after Britain handed back sovereignty to China in 1997.Yao joined Goldman Sachs in New York in 1990, straight from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, where he graduated with an economics degree. He moved to Hong Kong with the Wall Street bank in 1993, handling large Chinese and Hong Kong IPOs such as MTR's listing and BOC Hong Kong (Holdings) $2.8 billion offer in mid-2002.From multi-billion-dollar deals, Yao switched focus to small-and medium-sized issuers for about three years, founding ARX Advisors Ltd, a boutique investment firm, in 2003, before moving to DBS Group as head of equity capital markets for DBS Asia Capital. He joined Rothschild in 2006. There, he helped bring the Alibaba.com business-to-business unit public, and led talks to take it private again five years later. Yao also advised Alibaba on a series of acquisitions in the United States and China during that period. More recently, he helped Alibaba structure $12 billion of loans to bulk up its warchest to fund a spate of takeovers and a $7.1 billion share buyback from Yahoo Inc.Yao declined to be interviewed for this article, Alibaba spokeswoman Florence Shih said. Most of those cited in this article didn't want to be named to avoid straining personal ties with Yao or Alibaba.CATCHING UP Most of Yao's 23 years in banking have been in equity capital markets and mergers and acquisitions, so when Alibaba needed to borrow money in 2012 to buy back Yahoo's stock in the company he had a lot of catching up to do - holding lengthy talks with debt and loan specialists from Rothschild's team in London and meetings with lenders over terms and covenants that took ""many, many long hours into the night,"" said those familiar with the discussions.A $4 billion financing package - the largest for a private sector Chinese company at the time - caused some tension between Yao and loan bankers.""These were banks with different appetites for doing the transaction. Some were more difficult, some were easier on some situations on pricing and terms,"" said a person with direct knowledge of the talks. ""He did a pretty good job, putting together a good deal without ruffling too many feathers.""Last year, Yao negotiated ""an even better deal"" for Alibaba with an $8 billion loan with a group of nine banks, the person added.""He's a good mix of Western-trained and thinking banker, who is sensitive and culturally understands China. That mix is not that common in China's banking space. That's a pretty strong point,"" said one of those who has worked with Yao.""He strikes me as technically strong, someone who's very comfortable getting involved in execution.""

94,"  (Adds details on ownership, details on Yahoo)SAN FRANCISCO May 6 Alibaba Holdings Inc IPO-ALIB.N gave investors a closer look at the scale and growth of the Chinese e-commerce juggernaut in an IPO prospectus filed Tuesday in the first step of what could become the largest technology debut in history.Alibaba, which powers four-fifths of all online commerce conducted in the world's second-largest economy, is expected to raise upward of $15 billion and potentially surpass the $16 billion that Facebook Inc managed in 2012. It will become the largest Chinese corporation to have sought a home on U.S. exchangesThe company handled more than 1.5 trillion yuan, or about $248 billion, of transactions for 231 million active users across its three main Chinese online marketplaces in 2013, more than Amazon and eBay combined.""If it is able to transport that kind of power to outside China, it has the potential to become a true global ecommerce powerhouse,"" said Roger Entner, Lead Analyst and Founder of Recon Analytics. ""Everybody thought Amazon could do it but now we have to rethink Amazon in the light of being the most successful company in that field in the U.S. -- but not in the world."" Unlike many of the more prominent U.S. technology IPOs of recent years, Alibaba's list of significant shareholders is short. By contrast, Facebook and Twitter each broke out shareholdings from more than a half dozen individual principal shareholders.Former English schoolteacher and co-founder Jack Ma now owns 8.9 percent of Alibaba. Yahoo Inc and Softbank  own 22.6 percent and 34.4 percent of the company, which said on Tuesday it is still deciding between the New York stock exchange and the Nasdaq as a listing venue.Yahoo must sell roughly 40 percent of its Alibaba stake in the IPO or sell the shares back to Alibaba directly prior to the IPO. Yahoo and Softbank may be among the biggest beneficiaries of Alibaba's IPO, but neither will exercise much control of the Chinese company despite their shareholdings.Under an agreement struck with those two major shareholders, Yahoo Chief Development Officer Jacqueline Reses will resign from the board upon the listing, while Softbank will have the right to nominate just one director to a new, 9-member board. Alibaba's IPO has spurred levels of excitement in Silicon Valley and Wall Street circles unseen since Facebook Inc's  record-breaking $16 billion coming-out party.It will debut in a stock market where high-flying stocks like Twitter's and Amazon's have in past weeks been brought back to earth, in a selloff that has polarized Wall Street even as it revives doubts about soaring tech-sector valuations.The proposed IPO size in Tuesday's filing is an estimate for the purpose of calculating exchange registration fees. Analysts expect the company to eventually raise an amount surpassing Facebook's, garnering a market value of more than $160 billion.Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup will underwrite the IPO.

95,"  * Yellen cites housing, geopolitical tensions as economic risks* Alibaba IPO filing pressures Yahoo shares* Dow up 0.7 pct; S&P 500 up 0.6 pct; Nasdaq off 0.3 pct   (Updates to close)By Angela MoonNEW YORK, May 7 U.S. stocks mostly rose on Wednesday after comments from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen signaled continued support for the economy, but the Nasdaq fell for a second session as momentum names sold off.Financials and utilities were the day's biggest gainers, with the S&P financial sector index up 1.3 percent and the utilities sector index up 1.6 percent.On the Nasdaq, Yahoo! Inc fell 6.6 percent to $34.07 after Alibaba Group filed for an initial public offering that valued the Chinese e-commerce company well below analysts' consensus estimate.Analysts at BGC Partners and Atlantic Equities told Reuters that Alibaba's valuation disappointed some Yahoo investors. Yahoo holds a 22.6 percent stake in Alibaba, of which it must sell more than a third through the IPO.""The Alibaba IPO is drawing money out of Internet stocks because investors have to raise capital for the Alibaba IPO. That's why we see pressure on names like Google, Facebook and Amazon today,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. Google shares fell 1 percent to $509.96 while Facebook shares slid 2 percent at $57.39. Amazon.com Inc  declined 1.6 percent to $292.71.Groupon Inc sank 20.7 percent to end at $5.33 as its sales and profit projections for the current quarter trailed some estimates.Twitter Inc lost 3.7 percent to close at $30.66 after leading a selloff in Internet shares on Tuesday with an 18 percent tumble.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 117.52 points or 0.72 percent, to close at 16,518.54. The S&P 500  gained 10.49 points or 0.56 percent, to end at 1,878.21. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 13.085 points or 0.32 percent, to finish at 4,067.673. After declining in the morning session, the Dow and the S&P 500 moved into positive territory after Yellen said the U.S. economy was still in need of lots of support, given the ""considerable slack"" in the labor market in remarks to the congressional Joint Economic Committee.Yellen's comments enabled investors to shift attention to what may be an easing of the tensions in Ukraine, as Russian President Vladimir Putin called on pro-Moscow separatists in Ukraine to postpone a vote on secession just five days before it was to be held.""Janet Yellen didn't say anything new in her testimony. She continues to talk about how they are data dependent, how they can change on a dime, but she didn't say rates are going up any time soon, which is exactly what people expected,"" said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O'Neil Securities in New York.""Coupled with the fact that technically the market found some support, then (investors) started concentrating on what Putin said,"" Polcari added. Whole Foods Market Inc also contributed to the Nasdaq's decline as the organic grocer's stock tumbled nearly 19 percent to $38.93.The stock was the biggest drag on both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes a day after Whole Foods posted second-quarter results and cut its 2014 outlook.Of 422 companies in the S&P 500 that had reported earnings through Wednesday morning, 68.2 percent beat expectations, above the 63 percent average since 1994, and exceeding the 66 percent beat rate for the past four quarters, according to Thomson Reuters data.Profits are expected to rise 5 percent this quarter, down from 6.5 percent estimated at the start of the year, but above the low of 0.6 percent in mid-April, according to Thomson Reuters data.In the latest snapshot of the U.S. economy, the Labor Department said that U.S. nonfarm productivity fell at its fastest pace in a year in the first quarter because of severe weather. That led to the largest gain in unit labor costs in more than a year. Productivity fell at a 1.7 percent annual rate in the quarter, the Labor Department said.About 7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, well above the 6.1 billion average over the past five days, according to data from BATS Global Markets.Advancers outnumbered decliners on the New York Stock Exchange by a ratio of nearly 2 to 1.

96,"  * Chinese e-commerce giant files for most anticipated IPO since Facebook* Yahoo set to sell nearly half its stake in Alibaba IPO* Co-founders Ma, Tsai among largest individual Alibaba shareholders   (Adds proceeds, financial data, estimated value)By Alexei Oreskovic and Deepa SeetharamanSAN FRANCISCO, May 6 Alibaba gave investors a closer look at the scale and growth of the Chinese e-commerce juggernaut in an initial public offering (IPO) prospectus filed on Tuesday, the first step in what could be the largest technology debut in history.Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, which powers 80 percent of all online commerce in the world's second-largest economy, is expected to raise more than $15 billion, and could top the $16 billion pulled in by Facebook Inc when it listed in 2012.The bulk of the proceeds will go to Yahoo Inc - which bought a 40 percent stake in Alibaba in 2005 for $1 billion and which must sell more than a third of its current 22.6 percent stake through the IPO. Alibaba also plans to sell new shares, people familiar with the plans have said, to bulk up a cash war chest depleted by a rash of recent acquisitions.While the Alibaba brand is less well known in the United States than Internet companies such as Amazon.com and Facebook, the Chinese company's listing has stirred the most excitement in Silicon Valley and Wall Street since Facebook's record IPO. Alibaba will become the largest Chinese corporation to list in the U.S. - on either the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq.Alibaba will debut later this year in a market where high-flying tech stocks like Twitter and Amazon have fallen in recent weeks in a sell-off that has divided analysts and investors, reviving doubts about soaring tech valuations.Still, estimates of Alibaba's market value have soared in recent months, to even beyond $200 billion, underscoring Wall Street's eagerness to take a crack at a massive Chinese company with robust growth.Alibaba handled more than 1.5 trillion yuan - about $248 billion - of transactions for 231 million active users across its three main Chinese online marketplaces in 2013, more than Amazon and eBay Inc combined. It did so with 20,884 full-time workers, fewer than eBay.""If it's able to transport that kind of power to outside China, it has the potential to become a true global e-commerce powerhouse,"" said Roger Entner, lead analyst and founder of Recon Analytics. ""Everybody thought Amazon could do it, but now we have to re-think Amazon in the light of being the most successful company in that field in the U.S. - but not in the world.""Alibaba did not give any hints in its IPO prospectus about potential plans for the U.S. e-commerce market. Analysts said it was unlikely Alibaba would adopt the model favored by Amazon, which sells goods directly to consumers using a sprawling network of warehouses.AT LEAST 102 YEARS  Alibaba, founded 15 years ago in a one-room apartment in Hangzhou and controlled by a 28-member partnership, boasts of building a company that will last ""at least 102 years.""After the IPO, Alibaba said, the partnership will have the exclusive right to nominate a simple majority of the members of its board of directors.Alibaba operates an online messaging service as well as a cloud computing business, but more than 80 percent of its revenue comes from its Taobao, Tmall and Juhuasuan online marketplaces. Top items sold on Taobao include prepaid phone and game cards as well as lottery tickets, home furniture and baby products, the company said.Total revenue increased 62 percent to 18.75 billion yuan ($3.01 billion) in October-December of 2013 from a year earlier, while net income more than doubled to 8.27 billion yuan, according to the prospectus.Some analysts say Alibaba's rapid pace of revenue growth may be unsustainable.""They got into the e-commerce space when there weren't any other players in China,"" said Forrester analyst Kelland Willis, adding Alibaba has been ""losing market share year over year.""By 2020, online retail sales in China will reach $420-$650 billion, as much as the United States, Japanese, UK, German and French markets combined, according to a recent analysis by McKinsey Global Institute. MOBILE FUTURE Alibaba said China's mobile Internet arena, where it is battling Tencent Holdings for supremacy, is the next growth industry. China will have an estimated 750 million mobile Internet users by 2017, according to data from China-based consultancy iResearch.Roughly one-fifth of all purchases in the last quarter of 2013 were made on mobile devices, up from 7.4 percent a year earlier. But Alibaba added that for now these sales were less profitable than those made on its website.Already this year, Ma has been involved in acquisitions worth more than $3.5 billion - buying a stake in department store operator Intime ; a majority shareholding in movie producer ChinaVision Media; control of online mapping firm Autonavi ; a stake in China's Wasu Media Holding Co Ltd  for online content and internet TV; and a stake in Youku Tudou Inc, an online video business akin to Google Inc's YouTube.Alibaba is also launching a U.S. e-commerce website, 11 Main, and has taken stakes in U.S. retail site ShopRunner Inc, Lyft, a U.S. ridesharing service, and 1stdibs, an online market place for antiques and luxuries.Also this year, Ma has set up a charitable trust estimated to be worth $3 billion, potentially Asia's biggest, focusing on the environment and health. ""It's impossible for me to be a doctor, but I can have my own way to save lives,"" Xinhua quoted Ma as saying. OWNERSHIP AND RISKS Some analysts have pointed to a less-than-transparent decision-making process after Alibaba spun off fast-growing Alipay in 2010 - a move that caused consternation at major shareholders Yahoo and Japanese telecoms firm SoftBank Corp .Alibaba's prospectus also laid out a raft of regulatory risks it faces at home. The company stressed that Beijing could impose additional restrictions on the use of Alipay, the payment service that powers the majority of its online transactions.Unlike many prominent U.S. tech IPOs of recent years, Alibaba's list of significant shareholders is short. By contrast, Facebook and Twitter each broke out shareholdings from more than a half dozen individual principal shareholders.Former English schoolteacher and lead founder Jack Ma owns 8.9 percent of Alibaba. Joseph Tsai, a co-founder and executive vice-chairman, is the only other individual with a disclosed shareholding, of 3.6 percent. Yahoo and SoftBank, respectively, own 22.6 percent and 34.4 percent of Alibaba on a fully diluted basis.The proposed IPO of $1 billion in the filing is an estimate for calculating exchange registration fees.FAIR VALUE Alibaba estimated its fair value as of this month could reach $50 per share, an increase of more than six times from the $8 a share value estimated in June 2011, according to the prospectus. This calculation helps determine employee compensation and does not necessarily represent a likely IPO price.At the most recent fair value estimate, Yahoo's stake in Alibaba is worth $26.2 billion and SoftBank's almost $40 billion. Ma's stake would be worth $10.3 billion.The fair value estimate puts Alibaba's size at $116.1 billion, well below the $152 billion average from 25 analysts in a Reuters survey.While Yahoo and SoftBank may be among the biggest beneficiaries of the IPO, neither will exercise much control of Alibaba. It has already been agreed that Yahoo Chief Development Officer Jacqueline Reses will resign from Alibaba's board upon the listing, while SoftBank will have the right to nominate just a single director to a new, nine-member board.Alibaba's decision to list in the United States was a blow to the Hong Kong stock exchange, which was initially its preferred IPO venue, but the city's regulators balked at any potential violation of the ""one-share-one-vote principle.""Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank , Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, and Morgan Stanley will underwrite the Alibaba IPO.($1 = 6.2257 Chinese Yuan)   (Additional reporting by Gerry Shih, Sarah McBride, Deepa Seetharaman and Nicola Leske in New York and Elzio Barreto in Hong Kong; Writing by Edwin Chan; Editing by Alden Bentley, Andrew Hay and Ian Geoghegan)",2014-05-07,YHOO,"Wed May 7, 2014 | 2:09am EDT",UPDATE 4-China's Alibaba files in U.S. for what may be biggest tech IPO,http://www.reuters.com//article/alibaba-ipo-idUSL2N0NS1YA20140507?type=companyNews

102,"   By Tim McLaughlin | BOSTON  BOSTON Fidelity Investments Contrafund, the largest mutual fund investor in Yahoo Inc, cut its stake in the Internet media company by 41 percent during the first four months of 2014, according to the fund's latest disclosure.Contrafund portfolio manager Will Danoff had expressed confidence in Yahoo's management team at the end of the first quarter, but told Reuters in an exclusive interview in April he has been looking beyond tech companies to boost the fund's performance. Contrafund is up 1.93 percent this year, lagging the 4.97 percent return on the S&P 500 Index.Fidelity was not available to comment. The $108 billion Contrafund owned 24.3 million Yahoo shares at the end of April, down from 41.1 million shares at the end of 2013. In April, the fund sold about 5.3 million shares in Yahoo, an 18 percent reduction of its stake, according to Contrafund's latest disclosure.Yahoo shares are down 14 percent this year. The shares ranged in value during April from a high of $36.98 to a low of $32.15. The shares on Monday near midday were trading at $34.75.Yahoo's most valuable asset is its 23 percent stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, whose upcoming initial public offering could raise more than $15 billion, and could potentially top the $16 billion pulled in by Facebook Inc when it listed in 2012. The bulk of the proceeds will go to Yahoo, which bought a 40 percent stake in Alibaba in 2005 for $1 billion and which must sell more than a third of its current 22.6 percent stake through the IPO.Analysts have noted that Yahoo's stake in Alibaba is potentially more valuable than Yahoo's current market capitalization. Alibaba's value has been pegged at more than $160 billion, which puts the value of Yahoo's stake at about $37 billion. Yahoo current has a market cap of $35 billion.At the end of the first quarter, Danoff said he remained overweighted in Yahoo relative to the S&P 500 index ""due to our confidence in management's ability to stabilize and grow the core business."" At the end of April, even with the latest round of selling, Yahoo accounted for 0.82 percent of Contrafund's holdings. Yahoo makes up 0.19 percent of the S&P 500 Index.The mutual fund's biggest stake is in Google Inc, a Yahoo rival. Contrafund owned about $7.4 billion worth of the Google stock at the end of April, making up nearly 7 percent of its total holdings.

103,"   By Lewis Braham | Pittsburgh  Pittsburgh One morning in April, my Yahoo email account was disabled for no apparent reason.As a freelancer, my email account is my professional lifeline. But it wasn't just the security threat or potential for lost business that upset me. It was my personal history: jokes my brother sent me weeks before he died, emails from friends I hadn't seen in years, love letters from my wife. In the seven weeks since my account was shut, I've spent about 12 hours on hold with Yahoo customer service and corresponded with the company at least 15 times. Meanwhile, fearing a security breach, I changed the passwords to all of my online accounts, ordered new credit cards and had the credit reporting agency Equifax put my status on ""fraud alert."" I emailed contacts not to use or trust my old email address which may have been hacked. And I still don't have my email account back. Since then, I've learned it wasn't a security threat that was the problem. It was a question of ownership. And, if your email account is terminated, don't expect to revive it.After two weeks of calling and emailing Yahoo's customer service, I received a message on my Gmail account from Yahoo Customer Care informing me that my account had been disabled for violating Yahoo's Terms of Service. TERMINATED The email did not specify what terms I had violated, merely that ""Yahoo, in its sole discretion, may terminate your password, account (or any part thereof) or use of the Service, and remove and discard any content within the Service, for any reason."" I tried to figure out how I might have breached Yahoo's terms of service. The best I could come up with was that I had 'flamed' people (slang for insulting people online or expressing angry opinions) in message boards under Yahoo articles, after they'd flamed me.  But the truth was I didn't know. Yahoo's terms are flexible in defining violations, with its terms of service including agreement by the user not to send, share or post content that's ""unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortious, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, invasive of another's privacy, hateful, or racially, ethnically, or otherwise objectionable."" ""I think Yahoo left out the part where they say, 'Or if we just don't like it,'"" jokes Eric Goldman, law professor at Santa Clara University, who has written on email ownership rights. ""Unfortunately, federal law provides email service providers unfettered discretion to terminate accounts for whatever reason they want.""An email account over the Internet is a cloud-based service, Goldman notes. ""A cloud service can lock off your assets,"" he adds. ""They may still be your assets from a matter of legal ownership, but if you have no access to them, who cares?""    Microsoft and Google use language similar to Yahoo's for their terms of service, although Google says users own their data and access to it is important. ""If we discontinue a Service, where reasonably possible, we will give you reasonable advance notice and a chance to get information out of that Service,"" Google says.Just how many accounts are terminated annually is unknown - service providers don't release that data.  REACTIVATING THE ACCOUNT Since Yahoo would not reactivate my account, I asked the company for permission to download my old emails and contacts. A customer service rep promised a response, which never came. According to Yahoo spokesperson Erin Fors, Yahoo users must agree to comply with the company's terms of service when they create their Yahoo account. ""We have clear rules in our Terms, and in related guidelines documents, that set out what is and is not acceptable behavior on Yahoo services,"" Fors said via email.  Weeks after this nightmare descended on my inbox, I found a warning the company sent to an AOL account that I glance at infrequently. Why didn't Yahoo just send the warning to my Yahoo address? I will never know.     ALTERNATIVES What's your alternative to free service providers like Yahoo, Google and Microsoft? Several paid email service providers say that they allow customers to access old emails after disabling a user's account.""We never shut down access to e-mail data,"" says George Breahna, chief executive officer of PolarisMail. ""If we do decide to terminate the account, the customer will obviously be allowed to get back all their data."" PolarisMail charges $1 a month for a basic account with 25 GB of storage and $2 a month for extra features. GoDaddy charges $3.99 a month for 5 GB of storage. Rackspace charges $2 a month for 25 GB of storage.In the end, it's the correspondence with my wife I will miss the most. All the little notes we had exchanged through the course of our entire relationship; the corny but endearing declarations, the extravagant anniversary plans, the mundane grocery lists. Losing this account has taken the diary of my life with her and torched it.

104,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss | BOSTON, June 6  BOSTON, June 6 Sureview Capital, a small hedge fund which received starting capital from one of the industry's most powerful investors, Blackstone Group, shut down last month, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.The fund was founded by John Wu with seed money from Blackstone Alternative Asset Management in 2011 and last reported assets of $427 million on a regulatory filing.At the end of the first quarter Sureview, which specialized in picking stocks, listed CBS Corp as its biggest position and said it owned shares in Yahoo Inc and Facebook Inc, all of which suffered losses in March and early April. Sureview, based in Greenwich, Connecticut, did not respond to phone calls seeking comment. The industry sources requested anonymity because hedge funds are private.When it launched, Sureview was viewed as a potential new heavy hitter in the $2.7 trillion industry, not only because of Wu's resume, which included working at Kingdon Capital and Tiger Management before that, but more importantly because of Blackstone's seal of approval. Considered one of the industry's savviest investors, Blackstone invests roughly $55 billion in hedge funds and has raised more than $2 billion for its two so-called seeding funds, which help get new fund managers started. Competition for a piece of those assets, usually distributed in $100 million to $150 million chunks, was fierce, fund managers familiar with the selection process have said. Blackstone has seeded fewer than 20 new hedge fund managers.Industry analysts have said it is generally expected that not every manager in a seeding fund will mature and that some will shut down. Wu had a tough start in 2011 but returns were strong in 2013. This year, the fund struggled during the first quarter,  the people familiar with the fund and its performance said.Running a hedge fund has been especially difficult recently with the industry's performance paling in comparison to the broader stock market.Hedge funds lost money in April and March, and are up only 1.71 percent in the first five months of this year, according to data from Hedge Fund Research.

106,"  (Adds Yahoo's comment on Flickr)BEIJING, July 3 Access to online services such as messaging app Line and photo-sharing site Flickr was disrupted in China this week, a step that anti-censorship groups said was carried out by the government to block information about pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.Reuters reporters in China were unable to send messages on Line, owned by South Korea's Naver Corp, and KakaoTalk, owned by South Korean firm Kakao Corp. Both companies told Reuters they did not know the cause of the disruption or when service would return to normal.Users and Reuters reporters also could not access Yahoo Inc's Flickr photo-sharing site and Microsoft Corp's  OneDrive cloud storage service.Microsoft declined to give immediate comment. Yahoo said it was aware of the Chinese reports and investigating the situation. ""This is not a technical malfunction,"" said a member of China-based anti-censorship site GreatFire.org, who goes by the pseudonym of Charlie Smith.""I imagine these latest blocks are attributable to the Hong Kong demonstrations,"" Smith said, adding that the services may have been blocked because they can be used for photo sharing.On Tuesday, thousands of pro-democracy protesters marched in Hong Kong in one of the biggest challenges to China's Communist Party rule in more than a decade. Some users of Chinese microblog Weibo Corp who commented on the march said on social media that their accounts had been blocked or removed.Chinese authorities with oversight of the Internet were not immediately available for comment. Line said that it already cooperates with China's government to censor banned phrases. ""In order for Line to advance into China, there was the need to adapt to the local environment,"" a company spokeswoman said.Since President Xi Jinping took power last year, the government has throttled online dissent and harshly punished those it views as critics of Communist Party rule and threats to its stability. Campaigns to ""clean the Internet"" and get rid of rumour-mongering and pornographic material have affected both domestic and overseas Internet services.China has also disrupted a number of Google Inc  services for the past month, including Google's search engine, Gmail e-mail clients and its online advertising services.The Google disruption began in the run-up to the 25th anniversary of the government's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators around Beijing's Tiananmen Square.

Maria is an exemplary Yahoo executive and we intend to fight vigorously to clear her name,"" a Yahoo representative said in an email. Zhang founded her own mobile company, Alike, which was acquired by Yahoo in 2013. She also worked at Microsoft and Zillow before joining Yahoo, according to her LinkedIn profile. In the complaint, Shi accuses Zhang of unfairly downgrading her performance reviews for the second and third quarters of 2013.The lawsuit alleges that the company's human resources personnel refused to conduct an investigation when Shi complained about her direct supervisor's advances.Instead, according to the complaint, Shi was put on unpaid leave and eventually terminated from her position in the company.

110,"  (Corrects paragraph seven of May 6 story to reflect Ma's apartment had more than one room)* Chinese e-commerce giant files for most anticipated IPO since Facebook* Yahoo set to sell nearly half its stake in Alibaba IPO* Co-founders Ma, Tsai among largest individual Alibaba shareholdersBy Alexei Oreskovic and Deepa SeetharamanSAN FRANCISCO, May 6 Alibaba gave investors a closer look at the scale and growth of the Chinese e-commerce juggernaut in an initial public offering (IPO) prospectus filed on Tuesday, the first step in what could be the largest technology debut in history.Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, which powers 80 percent of all online commerce in the world's second-largest economy, is expected to raise more than $15 billion, and could top the $16 billion pulled in by Facebook Inc when it listed in 2012.The bulk of the proceeds will go to Yahoo Inc - which bought a 40 percent stake in Alibaba in 2005 for $1 billion and which must sell more than a third of its current 22.6 percent stake through the IPO. Alibaba also plans to sell new shares, people familiar with the plans have said, to bulk up a cash war chest depleted by a rash of recent acquisitions.While the Alibaba brand is less well known in the United States than Internet companies such as Amazon.com and Facebook, the Chinese company's listing has stirred the most excitement in Silicon Valley and Wall Street since Facebook's record IPO. Alibaba will become the largest Chinese corporation to list in the U.S. - on either the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq.Alibaba will debut later this year in a market where high-flying tech stocks like Twitter and Amazon have fallen in recent weeks in a sell-off that has divided analysts and investors, reviving doubts about soaring tech valuations.Still, estimates of Alibaba's market value have soared in recent months, to even beyond $200 billion, underscoring Wall Street's eagerness to take a crack at a massive Chinese company with robust growth.Alibaba handled more than 1.5 trillion yuan - about $248 billion - of transactions for 231 million active users across its three main Chinese online marketplaces in 2013, more than Amazon and eBay Inc combined. It did so with 20,884 full-time workers, fewer than eBay.""If it's able to transport that kind of power to outside China, it has the potential to become a true global e-commerce powerhouse,"" said Roger Entner, lead analyst and founder of Recon Analytics. ""Everybody thought Amazon could do it, but now we have to re-think Amazon in the light of being the most successful company in that field in the U.S. - but not in the world.""Alibaba did not give any hints in its IPO prospectus about potential plans for the U.S. e-commerce market. Analysts said it was unlikely Alibaba would adopt the model favored by Amazon, which sells goods directly to consumers using a sprawling network of warehouses. AT LEAST 102 YEARS Alibaba, founded 15 years ago in an apartment in Hangzhou and controlled by a 28-member partnership, boasts of building a company that will last ""at least 102 years.""After the IPO, Alibaba said, the partnership will have the exclusive right to nominate a simple majority of the members of its board of directors.Alibaba operates an online messaging service as well as a cloud computing business, but more than 80 percent of its revenue comes from its Taobao, Tmall and Juhuasuan online marketplaces. Top items sold on Taobao include prepaid phone and game cards as well as lottery tickets, home furniture and baby products, the company said.Total revenue increased 62 percent to 18.75 billion yuan ($3.01 billion) in October-December of 2013 from a year earlier, while net income more than doubled to 8.27 billion yuan, according to the prospectus.Some analysts say Alibaba's rapid pace of revenue growth may be unsustainable.""They got into the e-commerce space when there weren't any other players in China,"" said Forrester analyst Kelland Willis, adding Alibaba has been ""losing market share year over year.""By 2020, online retail sales in China will reach $420-$650 billion, as much as the United States, Japanese, UK, German and French markets combined, according to a recent analysis by McKinsey Global Institute. MOBILE FUTURE Alibaba said China's mobile Internet arena, where it is battling Tencent Holdings for supremacy, is the next growth industry. China will have an estimated 750 million mobile Internet users by 2017, according to data from China-based consultancy iResearch.Roughly one-fifth of all purchases in the last quarter of 2013 were made on mobile devices, up from 7.4 percent a year earlier. But Alibaba added that for now these sales were less profitable than those made on its website.Already this year, Ma has been involved in acquisitions worth more than $3.5 billion - buying a stake in department store operator Intime ; a majority shareholding in movie producer ChinaVision Media; control of online mapping firm Autonavi ; a stake in China's Wasu Media Holding Co Ltd  for online content and internet TV; and a stake in Youku Tudou Inc, an online video business akin to Google Inc's YouTube.Alibaba is also launching a U.S. e-commerce website, 11 Main, and has taken stakes in U.S. retail site ShopRunner Inc, Lyft, a U.S. ridesharing service, and 1stdibs, an online market place for antiques and luxuries.Also this year, Ma has set up a charitable trust estimated to be worth $3 billion, potentially Asia's biggest, focusing on the environment and health. ""It's impossible for me to be a doctor, but I can have my own way to save lives,"" Xinhua quoted Ma as saying. OWNERSHIP AND RISKS Some analysts have pointed to a less-than-transparent decision-making process after Alibaba spun off fast-growing Alipay in 2010 - a move that caused consternation at major shareholders Yahoo and Japanese telecoms firm SoftBank Corp .Alibaba's prospectus also laid out a raft of regulatory risks it faces at home. The company stressed that Beijing could impose additional restrictions on the use of Alipay, the payment service that powers the majority of its online transactions.Unlike many prominent U.S. tech IPOs of recent years, Alibaba's list of significant shareholders is short. By contrast, Facebook and Twitter each broke out shareholdings from more than a half dozen individual principal shareholders.Former English schoolteacher and lead founder Jack Ma owns 8.9 percent of Alibaba. Joseph Tsai, a co-founder and executive vice-chairman, is the only other individual with a disclosed shareholding, of 3.6 percent. Yahoo and SoftBank, respectively, own 22.6 percent and 34.4 percent of Alibaba on a fully diluted basis.The proposed IPO of $1 billion in the filing is an estimate for calculating exchange registration fees.FAIR VALUE Alibaba estimated its fair value as of this month could reach $50 per share, an increase of more than six times from the $8 a share value estimated in June 2011, according to the prospectus. This calculation helps determine employee compensation and does not necessarily represent a likely IPO price.At the most recent fair value estimate, Yahoo's stake in Alibaba is worth $26.2 billion and SoftBank's almost $40 billion. Ma's stake would be worth $10.3 billion.The fair value estimate puts Alibaba's size at $116.1 billion, well below the $152 billion average from 25 analysts in a Reuters survey.While Yahoo and SoftBank may be among the biggest beneficiaries of the IPO, neither will exercise much control of Alibaba. It has already been agreed that Yahoo Chief Development Officer Jacqueline Reses will resign from Alibaba's board upon the listing, while SoftBank will have the right to nominate just a single director to a new, nine-member board.Alibaba's decision to list in the United States was a blow to the Hong Kong stock exchange, which was initially its preferred IPO venue, but the city's regulators balked at any potential violation of the ""one-share-one-vote principle.""Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank , Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, and Morgan Stanley will underwrite the Alibaba IPO.($1 = 6.2257 Chinese Yuan)   (Additional reporting by Gerry Shih, Sarah McBride, Deepa Seetharaman and Nicola Leske in New York and Elzio Barreto in Hong Kong; Writing by Edwin Chan; Editing by Alden Bentley, Andrew Hay and Ian Geoghegan)",2014-07-14,YHOO,"Mon Jul 14, 2014 | 1:03am EDT",CORRECTED-UPDATE 4-China's Alibaba files in U.S. for what may be biggest tech IPO,http://www.reuters.com//article/alibaba-ipo-idUSL2N0NS1YA20140714?type=companyNews

It powers four-fifths of all online commerce conducted in China, the world's second-largest economy, and handled more transactions in 2013 than Amazon.com Inc and eBay Inc combined.In its updated prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Alibaba boosted its estimated value to $130 billion, up from more than $116 billion in earlier filings. The figures, which fall short of several analyst estimates of the company's worth, were calculated to set employee compensation and do not necessarily represent the IPO price.The company also gave a more detailed explanation of its controversial decision in 2011 to spin out its Alipay payments service, a PayPal-like affiliated established in 2004.Ma started Alibaba in his apartment in 1999 and has since branched out into areas as diverse as e-payments and financial investment. But its complex governance structure and Ma's outside investments have raised questions about potential conflicts of interest and investors' ability to sway Alibaba's strategy and direction. He and 26 other Alibaba co-founders and senior executives at the company and its affiliates are part of a powerful group dubbed the ""Alibaba Partnership."" Alibaba has said the interests of the partnership may conflict with those of investors.""This governance structure and contractual arrangement will limit your ability to influence corporate matters, including any matters determined at the board level,"" Alibaba wrote. Ma's group already planned to designate four of Alibaba's nine directors prior to its IPO. With the new disclosure, the group can name six of 11 directors if they expand the board.Ma has an 8.9 percent stake in Alibaba. Other investors in Alibaba include SoftBank Corp with a 34.3 percent stake and Yahoo Inc, which owns 22.5 percent.In the updated filing, Alibaba said it needed to spin out Alipay and turn it into a domestic entity in 2011 to prevent delays in obtaining an operating license under newly issued Chinese regulations.Alibaba spun out Alipay to a group that includes Ma, who holds a 46 percent stake in Alipay through another company, Zhejiang Alibaba E-Commerce Co. Alipay provides the lion's share of payment services for the company's retail marketplaces.""This action enabled Alipay to obtain a payment business license in May 2011 without delay and without any detrimental impact to our China retail marketplaces or to Alipay,"" Alibaba said.

Yet the company's stock has more than doubled since Mayer took over in July 2012. Analysts credit the ever-increasing value of Alibaba, of which Yahoo owns roughly 24 percent.Alibaba is expected to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange this fall in what could be the largest U.S. technology IPO. Investors value the company, which handles more e-commerce than Amazon.com Inc and eBay Inc combined, at as much as $200 billion. Now, instead of being required to sell 208 million Alibaba shares in the IPO under the terms of a deal with Alibaba, Yahoo must sell 140 million shares, the company said on Tuesday.""Anytime you can keep more of an asset that's growing as fast as Alibaba is, that's a good thing,"" said JMP Securities analyst Ronald Josey.Mayer has improved certain aspects of Yahoo, such as boosting its mobile users, said Josey. But as the Alibaba IPO approaches, investors will increasingly focus on its shaky fundamentals, he said. Asked if Yahoo paid Alibaba to amend the share sale agreement, Yahoo Finance Chief Ken Goldman told analysts on a conference call that ""there is nothing specific that we have done.""While retaining a larger slice of Alibaba might keep investors happy and take the heat off Yahoo's own business, the move is not without its risks, noted BGC analyst Colin Gillis.If Alibaba's stock price does not fare well after its IPO, as occurred to Facebook in 2012, Yahoo may rue not selling early.""They have a window to sell and they're choosing not to,"" Gillis said. ""Now they're playing investor on us.""

132,"   By Matthew Miller | BEIJING  BEIJING Aug 13 Jack Ma, founder and executive chairman of Alibaba Group Holding, holds deep sway over executive and board appointments at China's biggest e-commerce company, and that influence is set to strengthen further at the firm, which is heading towards a New York IPO that is expected to raise more than $15 billion later this year.In Alibaba's latest filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), it said Ma this year initiated a bonus program that allowed senior executives and Alibaba staff to acquire share rights at an affiliated company he controls.Alibaba on Tuesday underscored the potential conflict of interest from Ma's role as Alibaba's executive chairman and as the controlling shareholder at the company which holds Alibaba's affiliated Alipay payment business - even as the company said it was forging a closer relationship with the unit.""If conflicts arise,"" Alibaba said in an amended SEC filing, ""such conflicts may not be resolved in our favor.""Companies routinely amend their filings ahead of an IPO. In Tuesday's filing, Alibaba expanded its ""risk factors"" comments, but it was not clear whether this reflected any concerns raised by the SEC or potential investors.Alibaba's CEO Jonathan Lu, chief people officer Lucy Peng, and chief risk officer Shao Xiaofeng, are among 20 senior executives who have benefited from the bonus program, taking share rights which provide the holder with the economic benefits of the stock, company registration documents show.All 20, along with Ma, are members of the Alibaba Partnership, the 27-member group which will have the exclusive right to nominate a majority of Alibaba's board of directors, documents show.A bonus scheme granting employees at a listed company shares in an unlisted affiliate doesn't raise any legal concerns, but it is unusual for a firm to allow an executive to independently determine compensation, corporate governance experts say.The scheme potentially further separates Alibaba investors from voting control of the company, said Charles Elson, director at the Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. ""For investors, it's a troubling structure. Public shareholders are going to put up lots of capital, but get very little back in terms of control."" The rewards program, which Ma intends to continue using, may also deepen the 49-year-old executive chairman's control of Alibaba's executive management, and allow him to further influence how the company's board is selected.""Alibaba is doing many things that go against what is considered best practice in corporate governance,"" said Paul Gillis, an accounting professor at Peking University's Guanghua School of Management. ""These kinds of structures can be dangerous in a large organization because they lack transparency and may misalign the interests of shareholders and employees."" PAYMENT, FINANCIAL SERVICES Ma this year began distributing share rights for Zhejiang Alibaba E-Commerce (Small and Micro Financial Services Co), a Hangzhou-registered company that holds Alipay and other financial services licenses. Ma stripped Alipay from Alibaba four years ago in a controversial move that damaged relations with major shareholders, led by Yahoo Inc.Alibaba's 20 executives acquired about 42 percent of Small and Micro Financial Services' shareholding rights through participation in Hangzhou Junao Equity Investment Partnership, an entity registered late last year which is controlled by Ma through a separate unit, Hangzhou Yunbo Investment Consultancy Ltd.Alibaba said on Tuesday that Ma believes the equity-related awards tied company employees ""to the success"" of Small and Micro Financial Services, which has entered into a more far-reaching framework agreement with the e-commerce firm. As of March, the Alibaba executives agreed to pay 921.3 million yuan ($149 million) for the share rights, company registration documents show. The rest of Small and Micro Financial Services was recently transferred to Hangzhou Junhan Investment Partnership, another entity controlled by Ma, Alibaba said in its filings.In March, Ma also used Junhan to give similar share-based awards to most Alibaba employees, Alibaba said in a July SEC filing. Ma intends to ""issue additional share-based awards"" to Alibaba staff ""from time to time in the future,"" it added.The Junhan share-based employee awards will be vested ""upon the fulfilment of requisite service,"" Alibaba said. Similar awards by Junhan will be subject to the approval of the company's audit committee.The awards, to be settled in cash, are similar to share appreciation awards and are linked to the valuation of Small and Micro Financial Services. Junhan has the right to buy back the awards if the company should sell shares in a public offering.Ma's own stake in Small and Micro Financial Services would be ""reduced over time"" to equal his 8.9 percent shareholding in Alibaba Group, with the share reduction to take place over the next 3-5 years, Alibaba said on Tuesday.While Alibaba isn't obliged to pay for the awards, and the Alibaba founder pledged not to receive ""any economic benefit"" from the reduction in his shareholding in Small and Micro Financial Services, the company will record future related costs, it said.""Jack (Ma), through his role with us and his control over Junhan could be in a position to propose and promote further share-based grants that result in additional, and potentially significant, expenses to our company,"" Alibaba said in Tuesday's filing.(1 US dollar = 6.1684 Chinese yuan)   (Editing by Ian Geoghegan)",2014-08-13,YHOO,"Wed Aug 13, 2014 | 1:24am EDT",Alibaba bonus scheme strengthens Ma's control,http://www.reuters.com//article/alibaba-bonuses-idUSL4N0QB3F020140813?type=companyNews
133,"  (Adds data on fund holdings)By Deepa Seetharaman and Ryan VlastelicaSAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK Aug 26 Investors are looking over portfolios to make room for Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holdings Inc's market debut next month - and that means some less attractive stocks that funds are holding might be shown the door.The initial public offering, which could top $16 billion to become the largest-ever IPO by a technology company, is expected as early as next month after Alibaba management kicks off a two-week investor road show after the Labor Day weekend.As investors take a hard look at their portfolios, it may trigger a veritable garage sale of names that are failing to impress Wall Street, including U.S. e-commerce rival Amazon.com Inc, fund managers said.""Any company that didn't meet expectations and give a rosy outlook is probably being considered as a sale candidate to make room for a name like this,"" said Jim O'Donnell, chief investment officer of Forward, which has $5 billion in assets under management.""There won't be wholesale turnovers of portfolios, but I imagine Amazon is being looked at,"" he added.Chinese rivals like Baidu Inc and Tencent Holdings Ltd also may be pressured if fund managers view Alibaba, which powers 80 percent of all online commerce in China, as a better path to tap into growth in the world's second-largest economy.Next month's roadshow is likely to attract interest from a wide range of funds, including those focused on emerging markets and technology. Alibaba may garner a valuation of $200 billion or more when it goes public, analysts say, which would make it one of the 20 biggest companies listed in U.S. markets.""It is the 8,000-pound gorilla coming for the stock market,"" Michael Reynal, portfolio manager at San Francisco-based RS Investments, said of Alibaba. YAHOO ARBITRAGE How investors act also depends on whether they gain a toehold in the highly anticipated IPO at all. One topic of debate is how investors who are boxed out of the IPO will play Yahoo Inc, which holds a 22.5 percent stake in Alibaba.The U.S. web portal has struggled to reinvent its core business, but has nonetheless seen its shares more than double in the last two years on the strength of its Alibaba ties. Some investors say Yahoo Inc could be sold to clear room for Alibaba. By some measures, the company carries a high valuation, with its enterprise value to sales ratio surpassing 90 percent of the U.S. stock market, according to Starmine, a Thomson Reuters company.On the flip side, investors boxed out of Alibaba's IPO could snap up Yahoo to capitalize on the Chinese company's growth. That argument could also help buoy shares in Softbank Corp , which has a 34 percent stake in Alibaba.

Shares of Exxon Mobil fell 1.5 percent and Schlumberger's were down 2.1 percent, among the biggest drags on the S&P 500.A stronger dollar pushed dollar-denominated commodities lower.

The stock has come under pressure of late, with the premarket move indicating its fourth straight daily decline. Morgan Stanley's call comes amid broader bearish views on the U.S. auto industry, which it cut to ""cautious"" from ""in-line,"" saying that easy credit and leasing was pulling forward demand from the future. It is cutting its price target on Ford to $16 from $17 and is lowering its target on General Motors to $29 from $33.Futures are on track for a modestly lower open on Monday, with investors finding few reasons to extend a long-running rally that has taken indexes to repeated records amid overseas concerns and few domestic catalysts.

138,"  (Repeats for wider distribution)By Jessica ToonkelSept 7 When Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding IPO-BABA.N revealed plans earlier this year to go public on a U.S. stock exchange, financial advisers like Bob Mecca in Hoffman Estate, Illinois braced themselves for a wave of frantic calls from retail investors wanting to get in on the action.Alibaba, which sells more than Amazon.com Inc and EBay Inc combined, could raise over $21 billion in its IPO. It is often described as technology's hottest initial public offering since Facebook Inc's 2012 debut, although initial pricing announced on Friday was less than many predicted.Retail investors generally get only 10-20 percent of shares in big IPOs, and several advisers told Reuters they had expected a scramble from clients. But the phone has not been ringing off the hook.""People are on Facebook, they know it, but no one has ever heard of Alibaba,"" said Mecca, who has $175 million in assets under management.The number of client inquiries about the Alibaba IPO is around a quarter of what it was for Facebook at this stage of the process and about half of what it was for Twitter Inc, said Steve Quirk, senior vice president of the group serving active traders at discount broker TD Ameritrade Holding Corp.Robert Christie, a spokesman for Alibaba, declined to comment, citing the company's pre-IPO quiet period. Alibaba's decision to price its shares between $60 and $66 per American Depository Share is an indication that the company may not be too concerned about having a big U.S. retail investor base, since retail investors prefer stocks that cost much less per share. Alibaba could have raised the same amount of money by selling more shares at a lower price.One consequence of retail investors sitting out the debut could be a muted first day of trade, rather than the ""pop"" many expect from a tech IPO.""Because it is such a large deal and you aren't going to see a lot of retail investor interest, I do not think it's going to have a lot of momentum when it gets out of the gate,"" said Tom Taulli, an independent IPO expert.Longer term, tepid U.S. retail interest could be a drawback for Alibaba. Individuals tend to hold stocks longer, providing stability to the share price, and they help diversify the shareholder base. Having too much concentration among a small number of institutional investors, for example, could make the company vulnerable to attacks by activists, IPO experts said. ""I think a strong retail base is much better for Alibaba,"" said Josef Schuster, founder of Chicago-based IPOX Schuster LLC, which helps create index funds for IPOs.Still, retail interest could ramp up. Bargain hunters could take note of the lower-than-expected initial price and the company's pre-IPO roadshow, to promote the offering to fund managers, could spark wider interest.The roadshow kicks off on Monday in New York and is expected to reach around the globe to London and Hong Kong. That will provide stronger evidence of institutional investor interest and indicate whether shares are likely to be priced in the initial range. Industry analysts had expected Alibaba to lock down a valuation of more than $200 billion, but the high end of the initial range would put it about $163 billion. OTHER WAYS IN Alibaba has some major, publicly traded investors, which give Alibaba fans other ways to get into the stock early. One UBS AG adviser said that some retail clients expecting to get shut out of the IPO have opted to buy shares of Japan's Softbank Corp, which has a 34.1 percent stake in Alibaba going into the IPO.For the same reason, James Gambaccini, a Fairfax, Virginia-based independent financial adviser, said he has a few clients that have opted to invest in Yahoo Inc, which has a 22.4 percent stake in Alibaba. Softbank's and Yahoo's stakes will shrink from dilution in the IPO, and Yahoo will sell some shares, but both will remain major Alibaba shareholders.But for the most part, Gambaccini said the demand for Alibaba shares has been lackluster, partially because many people have not heard of the company and some who know about it were wary of China, concerned by the potential for government interference, for example.Alan Haft, a Newport, California-based adviser, has been trying to interest clients in Alibaba for months. But he said it has been an uphill battle.""It's clear to me that most people know very little about this company and just how enormous the IPO is likely going to be as well as how impactful this company is,"" Haft said.

140,"   By Andrew Chung  A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday revived part of a patent lawsuit brought by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen against AOL, Apple, Google and Yahoo, saying a lower court incorrectly found that the tech companies didn't infringe one of its patents. The patent, held by Allen's Interval Licensing, relates to the ubiquitous pop-ups that computer users routinely see while surfing the Web or shopping online.The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said that Chief Judge Marsha Pechman of the federal district court in Seattle had made an ""erroneous"" interpretation of the patent in 2013 and it sent the case back to her for further hearings.At the same time, Circuit Judge Raymond Chen agreed with Pechman for invalidating certain claims made over the same Interval patent, and a second one, declaring them too ambiguous.  Interval Licensing is the patent-licensing arm of a Silicon Valley research entity that Allen financed, Interval Research Corp, which shut down in 2000. Interval Licensing sued the tech companies in 2010 for allegedly infringing four of its patents, although only two became the subject of the appeal. It said they infringed the patents through products and software that use pop-up notifications, court documents said. Attorneys for Interval could not immediately be reached for comment. Nor could attorneys for the defendants.  Allen and partner David Liddle founded Interval Research in 1992. It employed over 110 scientists and engineers and was granted 300 patents during its existence, according to court documents. The case is Interval Licensing v. Aol Inc, Apple Inc, Google Inc, and Yahoo! Inc, U.s. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, Nos, 2013-1282, -1283, -1284 and -1285.

143,"  SAN FRANCISCO The U.S. government in 2008 threatened to fine Yahoo Inc $250,000 a day if it failed to turn over customer data to intelligence agencies, according to documents unsealed on Thursday. The documents shed new light on how the government dealt with U.S. Internet companies that were reluctant to comply with orders from the secretive U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which rules on government requests to conduct surveillance for national security issues. Yahoo lost the battle, which experts say helped pave the way for the Prism surveillance program revealed last summer by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. ""It’s always been a little bit behind the curtain as to what Internet companies do when they actually receive these requests.  Now we have evidence that Yahoo did in fact fight this battle and look at considerable fines as a consequence of not disclosing the data,"" said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center.""It tells us how very serious the Bush administration was about trying to get the Internet firms to turn over this data. Until the disclosure, it was mostly hearsay that they were willing to impose these penalties.""""That’s heavy handed,"" he added, referring to the threat of fines. A filing to the secret court by U.S. government asked that Yahoo be made to pay a minimum fine of $250,000 for each day it refused to comply with a court order to turn over user data, with the fine to double each successive week. U.S. Internet companies want to disclose as much as they can about the little-known procedure through which federal agencies request their user data in secret courts, in part because of worries about the impact on their business.On Thursday, Yahoo said it would begin to make public some 1,500 previously classified pages documenting a lengthy tussle with the government. ""Despite the declassification and release, portions of the documents remain sealed and classified to this day, unknown even to our team,"" Yahoo General Counsel Ron Bell said in a blog post on Yahoo's website on Thursday.The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, whose members are appointed by the U.S. Supreme Court chief justice, has never held a public session and generally hears only from the U.S. Justice Department and intelligence agency lawyers.Privacy advocates said the release of the Yahoo documents, even in their heavily redacted form, provided important information about the controversial surveillance practices. ""It fills in more gaps than what we knew about the challenge,"" Mark Rumold, a staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

147,"   By Gerry Shih and Matthew Miller | BEIJING, Sept 15  BEIJING, Sept 15 Inside Alibaba, where co-founders are revered like rock stars, relatively few employees know about the soft-spoken executive who for years kept his same cramped office, unfashionable clothes and the self-effacing demeanor of a metalworker's son.But for investors in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's  potentially record initial public offering, Simon Xie, a co-founder and vice president, represents one of the e-commerce company's most important figures: he's the only individual besides Executive Chairman Jack Ma who owns the domestic Chinese companies and holds the operating licenses that underpin Alibaba's corporate structure.Alongside Ma, who holds the lion's share of those domestic firms, Xie wields full legal sway over the onshore entities and the critical contracts that link them with the New York-listed vehicle.Yet much remains unknown about Xie, and the unusual shareholding arrangement has puzzled even high-level insiders. Some employees, said a former executive who worked closely with Xie, jokingly refer to the unassuming 45-year-old as shoufu - or ""top millionaire"" - even though he is not among the very top Alibaba shareholders.In 15 years, Xie has given just one published interview, to his hometown newspaper. He helps run - but does not lead - Alibaba's investment division and was not named in a recently published list of 30 managers who form Alibaba's steering committee. But the low profile belies Xie's status as one of Ma's most trusted business partners, multiple former executives and outside analysts say.""Simon Xie is clearly the most important person in Alibaba who is not part of the steering committee,"" said Fredrik Oqvist, the Beijing-based founder and CEO of ChinaRAI, a consulting firm that advises hedge and mutual funds. ""He pops up everywhere, yet he's elusive.""Alibaba declined to comment for this story, citing the quiet period ahead of its IPO.COUNTING PENCILS Interviews with friends and past co-workers, most of whom declined to be named to protect their relationship with Xie, paint a picture of a deep-thinking and earnest colleague who is treated like family by Ma, but who never climbed to the top of Alibaba's management ladder - a reflection of the company's cut-throat but meritocratic culture.And even as his fortune soared with Alibaba's rise, Xie remained largely unchanged from the shy boy who grew up in poverty as one of four children in a town near the Zhejiang province coastline.Xie was introverted and studious, an above-average student with a preference for math and science, said Chen Liangming, the principal of Rui'an Middle School who taught Xie in his politics class in the 1980s. Xie ranked in the top-20 students in his class, but not the very top - ""the kind of marks you'd expect from a student who has some creative ability,"" said Chen, who asked Xie in 2012 for an alumni donation, and received a 200,000 yuan ($32,630) gift.After graduating in 1992 with a degree in engineering from Shenyang University of Technology in northeastern China and working for a telecoms company in Hangzhou, Xie agreed to join Ma at Alibaba in 1999 as its first chief financial officer.He was remembered for keeping meticulous records of how many pencils and reams of paper were purchased, and teaching other employees how to use Microsoft Excel, said a person who worked alongside Xie for close to 10 years.In 2000, as Alibaba looked for new office space, Ma clamored for an entire floor of a downtown Hangzhou building while Xie argued it would be wasteful. Xie won the debate, but Ma was proved right as Alibaba's headcount quickly mushroomed, according to ""The Legend of Alibaba"" by Sun Yanjun, a veteran business journalist who worked with Ma on his first start-up, China Page, in the 1990s.INSTRUMENTAL PARTNER Keen to try other roles by the early 2000s, Xie pushed for greater involvement in the e-commerce business, friends say, and eventually made management rotations that included leading Alibaba's analytics and corporate strategy teams and managing the important Chinese website.Yet even as his position changed every few years, Xie's name remained a constant alongside Ma's in some of the most critical documents binding Alibaba's business. Chinese companies traditionally require at least two shareholders; that has been particularly true of domestic firms holding restricted government licenses. Chinese laws also forbid foreign ownership of internet companies.As such, investors in Alibaba's New York-listed shares will in fact own stakes in a Cayman Islands-registered holding company that acquires its critical operating licenses, along with some of its revenue, from contracts with five Chinese firms known as variable interest entities (VIEs).Besides the five companies that anchor Alibaba, Xie also holds an 11.6 percent stake in Zhejiang Alibaba E-Commerce, an affiliated company that contains Alibaba's payments processing and financial services arm, according to company filings as of March 31. The company is now called Zhejiang Ant Small & Micro Financial Services Group.Zhejiang Alibaba controversially came into Ma's hands in 2010 after he voided its VIE contracts. Alibaba shareholders Yahoo Inc and SoftBank Corp vigorously protested the move, while Ma argued it was necessary to comply with anticipated Chinese central bank regulations governing foreign ownership of financial firms.Xie has also been an instrumental partner for Ma in a variety of related party transactions. In April, Xie received a $1 billion loan from Alibaba to purchase a 20 percent stake in internet TV provider Wasu Media Holding - a move seen as part of Alibaba's strategy to break into the media industry. The same month, Xie and Ma paid 3.3 billion yuan ($538.4 million) for a 20.6 percent stake in China's biggest financial software firm, Hundsun Technologies.""He's there because Jack (Ma) wants him there,"" said Drew Bernstein, managing partner for the China affiliate of the accounting firm Marcum Bernstein Pinchuk. ""Jack must have some respect for him. He must have felt he belongs there, for things he contributed in the past, or what he can contribute in the future.""In its latest investor prospectus, Alibaba warned that Ma and Xie, given their joint investment activity, ""may not act in our best interest"" and that the company would incur substantial costs in the event Xie fails to repay his loan. LACKING AMBITION People close to Ma and Xie, who still live relatively close to each other in Hangzhou, said each appreciated the other's wit and sincerity and would visit each other's homes to dine, drink and play cards.""He never reported to Ma, per se,"" one person said. ""They spoke to each other like brothers.""Like Ma, who is known within Alibaba to speak in colorful allegories, colleagues said Xie's speech is also imaginative and steeped in historical references. An avid reader, Xie would recommend friends fantasy novels like the ""Grave Robbers' Chronicles"".He's fond of making jokes and puns, particularly over cups of his favored baijiu, a fiery Chinese sorghum-based spirit also known as baigan. During one drinking session with colleagues in the early 2000s, Xie joked that he should stop drinking baigan, because the name of that spirit is a homonym in Chinese for ""working in vain.""Despite his laid-back charm, some former colleagues said Xie never demonstrated first-rate leadership or ambition, especially as Alibaba saw explosive e-commerce growth.In recent months, Alibaba named Zhang Hongping as managing director of Alibaba Capital, where Xie works, while much of the investment decision-making rests with Executive Vice Chairman Joe Tsai, people familiar with the matter said.Xie confided to friends a desire for greater autonomy in making investment decisions. He wanted to invest not just to further Alibaba's strategic interests, but also to seek pure financial returns, one longtime friend said.In his investments for Alibaba, Xie has overseen deals for e-commerce firms as well as travel-related sites QYer.com and 117go.com, and Kuaidi, a taxi-hailing app, one friend said.Several friends said they were not surprised to see Xie excluded from the steering committee list, with one saying he noticed Xie's personal drive appeared to wane in recent years compared to younger, more ambitious rising stars like Eddie Wu, formerly Alibaba's mobile chief and now head of corporate development.One investment colleague speculated it was Xie's even temper and a mutual understanding forged over 15 years that make him Ma's most trusted lieutenant.""To be honest, Simon hasn't been that hungry in recent years. He feels happy where he is,"" the colleague said, adding: ""Whatever old Ma says, Simon listens.""(1 US dollar = 6.1296 Chinese yuan)   (Additional reporting by Beijing newsroom; Editing by Ian Geoghegan)",2014-09-14,YHOO,"Sun Sep 14, 2014 | 5:00pm EDT",INSIGHT-Simon Xie: Jack Ma's unassuming lieutenant at Alibaba,http://www.reuters.com//article/alibaba-group-ipo-xie-idUSL1N0RC0A820140914?type=companyNews

After giving at least half back to investors and paying taxes, Yahoo's cash stockpile, currently $4.2 billion, may swell by $3.1 billion. That is not a lot in Silicon Valley these days. “They are not in a position to make huge acquisitions,” said Jean Yu, assistant portfolio manager of the $2.8 billion ClearBridge Value Trust fund, which owns Yahoo shares. Yu expects the new proceeds to be used for deals around several hundred million dollars each. Yahoo’s revenue growth has stalled in recent years as its once-hot Web portal and email service have lagged rivals. Key areas in need of repair include Yahoo's mobile offerings and an advertising system that doesn't deliver the precise targeting available from rivals like Google Inc and Facebook Inc, investors say. Yahoo is not one of the first three or four places that consumers go to on their mobile phone, said Bill Tai, partner emeritus at venture capital firm CRV.“All the momentum right now is shifting rapidly to mobile,"" said Tai. Chief Executive Marissa Mayer has more than doubled monthly mobile users to 450 million since taking the helm two years ago. She revamped the line-up of mobile apps by making small acquisitions that brought in teams of mobile engineers. That may be the path forward, too, since many of the best-known mobile properties are out of Yahoo's financial reach. Messaging service Snapchat, for instance, was recently valued at close to $10 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal.Online review site Yelp Inc is a long-rumored Yahoo acquisition target that could help Yahoo expand into new ""transactional"" businesses, such as restaurant food deliveries from which Yahoo would receive fees. But with a $5.5 billion market cap, Yelp would represent a huge acquisition for Yahoo that might not go over well with investors.  Yahoo was not immediately available for comment.  Some argue that Yahoo could get more bang for its buck by focusing its acquisitions on advertising technology, a sector where prices are not as rich.Publicly-listed ad tech companies such as The Rubicon Project Inc, YuMe Inc and Tubemogul Inc all have market values of roughly $400 million or less, while the privately-owned AppNexus was valued at $1.2 billion in its most recent funding round.

""I'm debating whether or not to drop him.""Gallo is among millions of Americans who take part in  fantasy football, which involves players building their own teams from NFL rosters and then winning or losing points, depending on how their players perform in real life each week.It is real life, off-field violence involving players, however, that is putting the NFL under scrutiny and fantasy football may be starting to feel the fallout.Companies such as Yahoo, Walt Disney's ESPN and CBS, generate millions of dollars in advertising and sponsorship fees for their fantasy sites and programming. Revenue in the fantasy world, where Yahoo and ESPN are market leaders, is expected to grow more than 7 percent a year through 2019 from $1.4 billion this year, according to research firm IBISWorld.Several NFL teams in the past week have moved to place players on a so-called ""exempt list,"" meaning they are on a paid leave of absence while the cases against them are resolved.  On Friday, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said that rules governing personal conduct will change, signaling a major shift in policy after the league's poor handling of domestic abuse cases. More than 41 million people play fantasy sports in the United States and Canada, spending an average of $111 a year on their teams through entry fees, subscriptions to web sites providing information and other related costs, according to the Fantasy Sports Trade Association. Football is the most popular fantasy sport in North America. Fantasy football aficionados are not expected to turn against pro football itself, but as their players fall out of real-world rosters and their fantasy teams are diminished, they may lose interest in their fantasy leagues, analysts said.George Leimer, vice president of ESPN Fantasy Products, said the NFL scandals have not affected their fantasy football game ""in any significant way.""""If you are a fantasy team owner, the reason that a player is unable to perform, due to injury or suspension or otherwise, that really doesn't matter,"" Leimer said in an email. ""Participation in our game continues to grow.""Daily fantasy sports provider FanDuel said its growth has not slowed and the number of players on its web site continues to increase on a weekly basis. Yahoo and CBS Sports declined to comment on the potential impact. Some fantasy players may be turned off by domestic violence allegations against NFL players, which could prompt them to spend less time on their teams or to stop playing altogether, said Robert Boland, a sports business professor at New York University.""That affects a whole lot of advertisers up and down the line,"" Boland said. ""You're going dark on parts of what is now very definitely the Football Inc business model.""America's top sports league and its leaders have also faced pressure from corporate sponsors, politicians and some fans since the Sept. 8 airing of a video showing former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice knocking his then-fiancee unconscious in an elevator.Linda Swanson, a 72-year-old retired schoolteacher in San Diego, who has played fantasy football with her grandson and other family members for three years, said she cut Rice from her roster after she saw the video. But she said she has no plans to reduce her time playing fantasy football.""It kind of brings everybody together, give everybody something to talk about and tease each other about.""Part of fantasy sports' appeal is the fantasy aspect itself, so when cold reality intrudes it can detract from the enjoyment, said Syracuse University pop culture professor Robert Thompson.""When I suddenly find myself thinking in a fantasy football game about whether I should put this person on my team because he might get charged for domestic violence, I think it's time to start playing Dungeons and Dragons,"" Thompson said.

On Thursday, a day before Alibaba's debut on the New York Stock Exchange, options trading peaked with more than 929,000 contracts changing hands.The spike in volume makes this the busiest week for Yahoo options since 2008, said Henry Schwartz, president of options analytics firm Trade Alert. The stock has benefited from the enthusiasm over Alibaba, of which Yahoo holds a 22.4 percent stake. The U.S. Internet company is expected to sell shares of the Chinese e-commerce company, that could boost Yahoo's cash stockpile, currently $4.2 billion, by as much as $3.1 billion. Investors hope that Yahoo will continue to benefit from Alibaba's earnings performance as it will maintain a stake in the company. ""This is just people speculating. If you can't get in on the IPO, this is the next best way to get in on it,"" said Lawrence McMillan, president of McMillan Analysis Corp.Traders are speculating that Yahoo will continue to rise in price, McMillan said. So far in September, Yahoo shares have risen 9 percent, and are up 4 percent for the year.  The stock lost one percent to close at $42.09 on Nasdaq on Thursday with nearly 90 million shares traded, its busiest day since October 2011.Options volume on Yahoo on Thursday was three times usual with 631,000 calls and 298,000 puts traded, according to Trade Alert data. ""For now, the focus is not on Yahoo, but rather the stake Yahoo has in Alibaba and the potential for a windfall from the IPO,"" Ophir Gottlieb, chief executive officer at Los Angeles-based Capital Market Laboratories LLC, said. Dan Mirkin, CEO at San Diego, California-based Trade-Ideas LLC, said Alibaba could open much higher than the level at which it is priced. The expected range for the stock was $66 to $68 a share, but some analysts, including Morningstar, said the shares should trade around $90 each. ""And if that is the case, that certainly is not priced into the Yahoo stock,"" he said.

189,"   By Yasmeen Abutaleb | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. stocks erased earlier gains to close lower on Wednesday as a shooting at the Canadian parliament unnerved investors, Boeing and Biogen sold off following results, and energy stocks fell along with oil prices.Indexes had traded in positive territory for much of the session, putting the S&P 500 on track for a fifth straight day of gains. Earnings initially drove the move higher, with technology and material shares up on the back of strong results.Market benchmarks began drifting lower after the government reported a surprise increase in crude oil inventories. Energy shares .SPNY were off 1.7 percent as crude oil CLc1 fell, settling near $80 per barrel.Canada's capital was jolted by the fatal shooting of a soldier and an attack on the parliament building in which gunshots were fired outside a room where Prime Minister Stephen Harper was speaking. Toronto stocks fell 1.6 percent, also affected by oil's slide. ""The situation out of Ottawa hastened the decline a bit, but I think it started with oil because people are very concerned about global growth,"" said John Canally, chief economic and investment strategist for LPL Financial. If the Ottawa shooting is related to domestic terrorism, Canally added, ""it'll put weight on the markets along with global growth.""  The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 153.49 points, or 0.92 percent, to 16,461.32, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 14.17 points, or 0.73 percent, to 1,927.11 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 36.63 points, or 0.83 percent, to 4,382.85.Weaker oil and the Canada violence offset some encouraging economic news.

Among the day's earnings movers, Biogen Idec (BIIB.O) fell 5.4 percent to $309.07 after sales of its multiple sclerosis drug, Tecfidera, fell short of lofty expectations.  Boeing Co (BA.N) lost 4.5 percent to $121.91, giving back most of the gains from the four prior sessions. Boeing reported higher-than-expected earnings and lifted its outlook, but analysts raised concern about the costs of the 787 Dreamliner. On the upside, Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) and Broadcom BRCM.O rallied a day after both tech companies reported better-than-expected revenue. Broadcom shares climbed 5.5 percent to $39.37 while Yahoo was up 4.5 percent at $41.99. The two made up the S&P 500's top percentage gainers.

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S were looking for adjusted revenue of $1.045 billion. For the first time Yahoo disclosed its mobile revenue, which it said was more than $200 million in the third quarter. Yahoo said it expects that gross mobile revenues for the full year will exceed $1.2 billion.Yahoo's revenue growth has stalled in recent years as its once-hot Web portal and email service have lagged rivals such as Google Inc and Facebook Inc.

The stock has since risen 44 percent from its IPO price of $68. Alibaba Group Holdings currently has a market capitalization of $250.5 billion, or 40 percent of Apple's $626 billion.Morgan Creek bought Alibaba two years ago before the shares began trading publicly, through private purchases, Yusko said at the summit, which was held in Reuters' New York office.""I actually believe that Alibaba is going to become the first global e-commerce company,"" Yusko said, adding that current Alibaba shareholder Yahoo Inc would most likely become part of the Chinese company. Yahoo did not immediately return a request for comment.Nevertheless, some investors have shied away from Alibaba, pointing to concerns about such things as its governance structure and conflicts of interest between founder Jack Ma's role as a steward of the company and his investment interests elsewhere.And China itself has become a source of wariness for many investors. Short-seller Jim Chanos, who spoke at the Reuters Summit on Tuesday, noted his own worries that the country is facing a credit crunch that will erode growth. But Yusko said that China still offers opportunities for investors looking to specific sectors. Morgan Creek, he added, is ""wildly bullish"" on five areas: retail, consumer, China Internet, healthcare and alternative energy.Within those sectors, Morgan Creek has bought shares in a Chinese sportswear company, China Dongxiang, which also owns shares of Alibaba; Tuniu Corporation, a travel company, and Dianping, a Yelp-like restaurant review and business listing site.China, Yusko added, is ""one of our biggest positions.""(Reporting by Luciana Lopez, Sam Forgione and Jennifer Ablan; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)",2014-10-29,YHOO,"Wed Oct 29, 2014 | 2:08pm EDT",REUTERS SUMMIT-Alibaba shares could more than double by 2017 -Morgan Creek's Yusko,http://www.reuters.com//article/china-summit-yusko-idUSL1N0SO1J220141029?type=companyNews
199,"  (Corrects title of Ma to executive chairman in 17th paragraph)SAN FRANCISCO/BEIJING Nov 3 Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's first full quarterly report card to Wall Street investors on Tuesday will be scrutinised by the hopeful seeking validation for lofty stock price targets and studied by the few sceptics searching for inauspicious signs.Coming off Alibaba's record-breaking $25 billion IPO in September, the company's shares have remained 45 percent above their debut price. Just about every brokerage has rated the e-commerce giant a buy, taking comfort in the group's dominant position in a $450 billion Chinese market.Investors have been all too eager to overlook a structure that critics say allows its management extraordinary decision-making power, potentially to the detriment of shareholders. They have also mostly withheld judgement on how advertising spending and sales commission fees, where Alibaba makes the lion's share of its money, are being affected in a slowing Chinese economy.Instead, their focus is on Alibaba's profit margins, among the fattest in the global e-commerce industry and far outstripping those of loss-making Amazon. Reflecting the positive sentiment, the firm's forward price-to-earnings ratio is pegged at more than 45.""The stock is now trading at a pretty high multiple, and in order to justify that, they need to show really strong results out of the gate,"" said Wedbush Securities' Gil Luria.While major shareholder Yahoo Inc has included basic figures such as Alibaba's revenue and earnings per share every quarter, Tuesday marks the Chinese company's first full-fledged results release.Net profit is expected at $1.17 billion in the quarter ended September, according to a Thomson Reuters SmartEstimate poll of 21 analysts. Fully reported earnings per share are forecast to be at 36 cents, based on a poll of 25 analysts. Wall Street will keep its eye peeled for any sign that runaway growth is waning.While Alibaba can depend on its still-growing home market for years to come, expanding internationally will be difficult given its marginal presence in foreign markets, which now yield just about 9 percent of overall sales, analysts say.At home, JD.com Inc is chipping away at its market share, using an Amazon-like model where it builds its own warehouses and handles logistics. Alibaba's marketplace model, relinquishing control over logistics, may hurt it in the long run by putting product quality at risk.""JD.com's efforts to compete with Alibaba through a vertically integrated approach remind us a bit of the eBay-Amazon battle,"" RBC's Mark Mahaney wrote in an Oct. 29 note. There are ""disadvantages in terms of limited control over customer service and fulfilment, logistics, and delivery"", he said.EXPANDING THE EMPIRE  Alibaba, which operates China's largest Internet shopping destination Taobao and retail site Tmall.com, is nearly unknown to most Americans but is ubiquitous in China.The Chinese e-commerce company, founded by former schoolteacher Jack Ma in his apartment in 1999, has designs of expanding beyond its commerce roots.The company has spent significant sums acquiring firms and startups in some of the fastest-growing mobile markets, delving into services such as messaging and digital content. It has even made select acquisitions in the United States, amid persistent speculation that Alibaba is preparing some sort of move against Amazon.It is also making moves to more closely resemble its U.S. peer, including establishing a cloud service that provides storage and computing (Aliyun), and a budding online video service.Alibaba's dominance of Chinese commerce has piqued interest in America. Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook has said he would be happy to work with Ma. The Alibaba executive chairman called on Hollywood studios all of last week, after headlining a major technology conference in Laguna Beach.Ultimately, what investors want to see is topline growth. Alibaba is expected to post revenue of about $2.7 billion in the September quarter, up about 52 percent from a previously reported $1.78 billion a year earlier. It is expected to have profit margins of more than 40 percent during the period.""There's going to be scrutiny of every number,"" Wedbush Securities' Luria said.

200,"  * Q2 profit rises 19 pct, beats analyst view* Revenue rises pct on PC growth; mobile revenue falls 6 pct* Announces HK$0.06/share dividend* Names Yahoo! co-founder Jerry Yang to board of directors   (Adds executive, analyst comments, context)By Gerry ShihBEIJING, Nov 6 Lenovo Group Ltd  reported quarterly revenue that missed analyst estimates, with a decline in smartphone sales curbing investor optimism about the world's biggest maker of personal computers (PCs) turning into a force in mobile devices.Lenovo's earnings came at a time of unprecedented competition in China's smartphone market, with rivals including fast-growing Xiaomi Inc, now the world's No. 3 handset maker. At the same time, the company is pulling ahead in the global PC industry.The Beijing-based company now has a PC market share of 20 percent and has extended its lead over Hewlett-Packard Co  and Dell Inc, according to IDC research. Sales of laptop and desktop computers rose 0.9 percent and 6.4 percent respectively in July-September, helping revenue rise 7 percent to $10.5 billion. That compared with an $11.35 billion estimate of 13 analysts according to Thomson Reuters SmartEstimate, which gives greater emphasis to more accurate analysts.But mobile device sales fell 6 percent to $1.4 billion in a rare stumble for Chief Executive Yang Yuanqing, who has been determined to muscle his way to the top of the global smartphone market.""Smartphone revenue was not that exciting, it was a little bit of a problem,"" Yang told Reuters in an interview after the results. He attributed the fall primarily to an accounting procedure pushing revenue from a significant shipment of phones in late September to the following quarter. Shares of Lenovo shed 5.1 percent after the results, compared with a 0.2 percent fall in the benchmark Hang Seng index.Nomura analyst Leping Huang said a reduction in handset subsidies from Chinese mobile phone networks have adversely affected Lenovo's home market.""All the smartphone vendors suffer from it,"" Huang said. ""But Lenovo fundamentally looks quite good.""Lenovo said net profit rose 19 percent to $262 million in the second quarter, exceeding the $260 million analyst estimate. It also announced a dividend payment of HK$0.06 ($0.0077) per share. SMARTPHONES AND SERVERS The PC market has been shrinking since the advent of tablet computers and smartphones. Lenovo has responded by diversifying, making two multi-billion-dollar acquisitions in quick succession for Google Inc's Motorola handset unit and IBM's  low-end server business.Last week Lenovo closed its $2.91 billion deal for Motorola, gaining an iconic albeit faded brand that still has a presence in North America and Europe, two markets Lenovo covets.Speaking on an earnings conference call on Thursday, Yang pledged to prioritize sales growth at Motorola without looking to cut expenses. He said he expected Motorola to turn a profit in four to six quarters, and that margins in Lenovo's smartphone business will be higher after integrating the U.S. unit.The company also on Thursday named Yahoo! Inc  co-founder Jerry Yang to its board of directors. Yang, who is also a director at Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, formerly served as a Lenovo board observer.

226,"  * Durable goods data sharply below expectations* Caterpillar, Microsoft shares slide after results* Apple up after the bell on strong revenue growth* Indexes down: Dow 1.7 pct, S&P 1.3 pct, Nasdaq 1.9 pct   (Updates with results from Apple, AT&T and Yahoo)By Ryan VlastelicaNEW YORK, Jan 27 U.S. stocks closed more than 1 percent lower on Tuesday as disappointing results from a number of bellwether companies pointed to weakening conditions, while an unexpected decline in durable goods orders also weighed on sentiment.The day's losses were broad, with nine of the 10 primary S&P 500 sectors lower on the day, though tech was the biggest drag by far. The group lost 3.3 percent in its biggest one-day drop since November 2011, in the wake of results from industry bellwether Microsoft. Industrial shares fell, led by Caterpillar.The two names were the biggest decliners on the Dow, but fellow components Procter & Gable and DuPont Co  also tumbled. Microsoft fell 9.3 percent to $42.66 a day after the main engine of its historic earnings power - selling Windows and Office to big businesses - showed signs of waning.Heavy machinery marker Caterpillar gave an outlook below expectations, warning the recent plunge in oil prices would hurt its energy equipment business. Shares dropped 7.2 percent to $79.85.""There's clearly a lot of froth baked into certain areas of tech, while Caterpillar is giving tangible evidence that things can go down more than they already have,"" said Jim O'Donnell, chief investment officer at Forward in San Francisco.""People may not be aware of the sensitivities that heavy industrial guys have to the oil cycle, or what the ripple effects of oil's weakness will be. There are a lot of companies that are going to be adversely impacted."" With 24 percent of the S&P 500 having reported, 70.6 percent of companies have topped earnings expectations while 55.5 percent have beaten on revenue, according to Thomson Reuters data. That compares with the long-term average of 63 percent for earnings and 61 percent for revenue.Still, many multinational companies disappointed this quarter, with the stronger dollar a common culprit.  P&G was one of the companies pressured by a stronger dollar, sending shares down 3.4 percent to $86.49.After the market closed, Apple Inc rose 5.4 percent to $115 after it posted better-than-expected revenue growth, along with record sales of its iPhone line.AT&T Inc's revenue rose more than expected in the latest quarter. Yahoo Inc reported its results and unveiled a plan for a tax-free spin-off of its 15 percent stake in China's Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, a first step in a highly-anticipated process to unwind the holding, valued at roughly $40 billion. Shares of AT&T rose 1.8 percent to $33.40 after the bell, while Yahoo added 7.7 percent to $51.69.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 291.49 points, or 1.65 percent, to 17,387.21, the S&P 500 lost 27.54 points, or 1.34 percent, to 2,029.55 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 90.27 points, or 1.89 percent, to 4,681.50.Adding to the day's weakness, a gauge of U.S. business investment plans unexpectedly fell in December, another sign that slowing global growth and falling crude oil prices were having an impact on the economy.On the plus side, consumer confidence posted its highest reading since August 2007. That helped indexes recover from their lows of the session; the Dow earlier fell as much as 2.2 percent.About 6.5 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, below the month-to-date average of 7.2 billion.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,726 to 1,337, for a 1.29-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,710 issues fell and 1,029 advanced, for a 1.66-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.The S&P 500 posted 41 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 57 new highs and 49 new lows.

""The main point is that the money goes to shareholders, it doesn't get spent on acquisitions.

But the company's forecast for revenue in the first quarter implied continuing softness. Yahoo said that revenue, excluding fees paid to partner websites in the first quarter, would range from $1.02 billion to $1.06 billion, compared to the $1.09 billion in the year-ago period.Yahoo said its board of directors has authorized a plan to spin off the stake, tax-free, into a newly formed independent registered investment company.

The spinoff of the second-largest stake in Alibaba is not expected to have much impact on the management of the fast-growing e-commerce company, but will be an option for investors who for some reason do not want to buy shares in it directly.The stake dates from 2005, when Yahoo bought into Alibaba early, paying $1 billion for a 40 percent stake in a deal credited to the American company's co-founder Jerry Yang.Yahoo's revenue, excluding fees paid to partner websites, declined 1.8 percent year-on-year in the final three months of 2014 to $1.18 billion, just shy of Wall Street expectations.

But investors appeared to have other concerns, four months after the company's $25 billion IPO.""Today's (stock price drop) is not about EPS, it's about the top line growth,"" said Tian Hou, a Beijing-based analyst with TH Capital.""When Alibaba said they were expanding, investing, people's expectations were for top line growth and the bottom line would shrink. However they did the opposite, so that was contradictory to expectations."" Even strong numbers for mobile revenues and total value of goods sold on smartphones, closely watched metrics in the world's biggest smartphone market, weren't enough to stop the Wall Street-listed stock being hammered as trading began on the New York Stock Exchange.Shares were down almost 10 percent at 1528 GMT at $88.75.Alibaba did not address Tuesday's announcement that its second-biggest shareholder Yahoo Inc plans to spin off its 15 percent stake in the Chinese company.But Alibaba's Executive Vice Chairman Joe Tsai did use the post-results conference call to take a shot at a Chinese regulator, after the watchdog called out the company in a report published on Wednesday for failing to do enough to stamp out illegal business on its platforms. Tsai said the report was ""flawed"" and assured listeners that Alibaba had not seen the report before it was published, nor had it requested its publication to be delayed. The report by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) sparked concern that Alibaba had failed to disclose risk factors to its investors prior to its bumper listing in September.SLIPPING GROWTH Revenue growth, at its lowest level since at least 2013, and margins slipped as sales through mobile devices, typically smaller-ticket items, accounted for a bigger slice of total sales than in the previous quarter.Gross merchandise volume (GMV), or the sum of all Alibaba's online commerce transactions, rose 49 percent to $127 billion. Mobile GMV continued to grow, accounting for 42 percent of total GMV, up from 36 percent in the September quarter.The number of mobile monthly active users nearly doubled from the same quarter the previous year to 265 million. Overall annual active buyers grew 45 percent to 334 million from 307 million in the September quarter - exceeding the population of the United States.

252,"   By Alexei Oreskovic | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) agreed to extend by 30 days the deadline to re-negotiate a ten year search deal, as the two Internet companies attempt to revamp a thorny partnership crafted by former chief executives.The search partnership, which took effect in 2010, allowed the companies to negotiate changes or to terminate the arrangement entirely after five years. Under the terms of the deal, the companies had 30 days to make changes following Feb. 23.According to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday, Yahoo and Microsoft mutually agreed to extend that deadline to a 60-day period following Feb. 23.""We value our partnership with Microsoft and continue discussions about plans for the future. We have nothing further to announce at this time,"" Yahoo said in a statement.  Microsoft declined to comment. It was not immediately clear if the extension signaled progress or lack of consensus between Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.

It will not be included in the planned spin-off of its stake in China's Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, she said.Investors have been urging Mayer to monetize the Yahoo Japan stake separately, after she announced plans to spin off the Alibaba stake in January, which could be worth $40 billion.The advisers will help Yahoo ""determine the most promising opportunities to maximize value"" for the Yahoo Japan stake, said Mayer. Yahoo shares rose after the announcement, following disappointing earnings results, trading up about 1 percent from their close at $44.49 on Nasdaq.But Wall Street remained broadly cautious about the plan.

It will not be included in the planned spin-off of its stake in China's Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, she said.Investors have been urging Mayer to monetize the Yahoo Japan stake separately, after she announced plans to spin off the Alibaba stake in January, which could be worth $40 billion. The advisers will help Yahoo ""determine the most promising opportunities to maximize value"" for the Yahoo Japan stake, said Mayer.Yahoo shares rose after the announcement, following disappointing earnings results, trading up about 1 percent from their close at $44.49 on Nasdaq. But Wall Street remained broadly cautious about the plan.""They are taking the slow train, stressing the process,"" said Colin Gillis, an analyst BGC Partners, who warned that a deal, if any, could be a long way down the line. ""Engaging advisers doesn't mean spinning it out.""  Yahoo owns about 35 percent of Yahoo Japan Corp, which has a market value of almost $25 billion on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Japanese internet company SoftBank Corp is the biggest shareholder, with about 36 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.Last month Yahoo shareholder Starboard Value LP said the Alibaba spin-off was a ""good first step"" but urged Yahoo to also spin off its Yahoo Japan stake in a tax-efficient manner.

Growth slowed to a crawl in the first quarter.Recent data has painted a mixed picture. Consumption, business spending and manufacturing data has suggested the economy is struggling, but housing starts were strong. While the Fed is broadly expected to raise rates this year, the timing of the move has kept the market on tenterhooks.""There is a consensus that the Fed probably doesn't move until September and I don't think that will change today,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.The latest Reuters survey showed most economists were now less convinced about when rates would be increased, but the median still suggested a move in the third quarter.A rate hike is not likely to be appropriate until early 2016, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said on Wednesday.

282,"   By Jonathan Stempel  A U.S. judge ordered Yahoo Inc to face a nationwide class-action lawsuit accusing it of illegally intercepting the content of emails sent to Yahoo Mail subscribers from non-Yahoo Mail accounts, and using the information to boost advertising revenue.In a decision late Tuesday night, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California said people who sent emails to or received emails from Yahoo Mail subscribers since Oct. 2, 2011 may sue as a group under the federal Stored Communications Act for alleged privacy violations.She also said a class of non-Yahoo Mail subscribers in California since Oct. 2, 2012 may sue as a group under that state's Invasion of Privacy Act.Holders of non-Yahoo Mail accounts accused Yahoo of copying and then analyzing their emails, including keywords and attachments, with a goal of creating ""targeted advertising"" for its estimated 275 million Yahoo Mail subscribers, in addition to detecting spam and malware.They sought an injunction barring the alleged interceptions, as well as damages. Yahoo in 2014 generated 79 percent of its revenue from search and display advertising. A class action can make it easier to obtain larger damages and more sweeping remedies at lower cost. The plaintiffs estimated that the nationwide class of non-Yahoo Mail subscribers has more than 1 million members.Rebecca Neufeld, a Yahoo spokeswoman, said the Sunnyvale, California-based company cannot comment on active litigation.Koh rejected Yahoo's arguments that some plaintiffs consented to its activity by emailing Yahoo subscribers even after learning how it used the information, and that the alleged injuries were too disparate to justify class certification. She distinguished the case from her March 2014 refusal to certify a similar class action against Google Inc on behalf of Gmail and non-Gmail subscribers because it was hard to determine which users consented to Google's activity.""Yahoo may have to, as a practical matter, adjust its scanning practices on an individual basis,"" Koh wrote. ""That does not, however, change the fact that plaintiffs seek uniform relief from a common policy that Yahoo applies to all class members.""Daniel Girard, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, declined to comment.

283,"   By Jennifer Cummings  When financial adviser Rick Kahler wanted to revamp his marketing strategy three years ago, he decided to learn about the hype surrounding “search optimization.”This is the catch phrase for strategies businesses use to make sure their websites are among the first to appear in results from online search engines like Google, Yahoo! and Microsoft Corp's Bing.Trying to show up at the top of prospective clients' Google searches can be time-consuming and expensive, but the effort can reap big rewards. A 2014 Fidelity Investments study found that about 1 in 5 investors said they would use internet research, other than social media and adviser rating websites, to find financial advisers.Kahler, based in Rapid City, South Dakota, hired a consultant who helped make his site more visible in results for search terms like “financial adviser” and “tax planning.” Three years later, traffic to the Kahler Financial Group website has doubled to about 3,500 hits a month. Earlier this week, the site was the first to appear in Google search results for “Rapid City financial adviser.” Kahler, whose firm manages $210 million in assets, said the effort, along with his blog and social media presence, has generated about half his business.A key to success is maintaining an engaging, consistently updated website. This can include frequent blog updates and videos. “Google doesn’t want brochures,” said Kahler’s consultant, Brent Carnduff, president of Advisor Web Marketing. “What Google wants is for every business to become a publisher.”Hiring a consultant to help can cost about $5,000 to $10,000 annually, said Mike Byrnes, president of Byrnes Consulting, LLC, a Boston area firm that helps advisers run their businesses.   If you aren't ready for that investment, a few steps can help boost your site's presence. You may ultimately decide to outsource the work to a professional. Focusing on search optimization is expensive, said Kahler, the adviser, but it is the only marketing he has to do.

(on.recode.net/1EW1dJi)Yahoo will have exclusive advertising rights to the game, which will also be available in a 30-minute on-demand version, Senior Vice President of product and engineering Adam Cahan said in an interview. The on-demand version will include commercials that viewers would not be able to skip.Yahoo was hopeful of more such partnerships in the future, Cahan said. The company has been trying to fight stalling revenue growth by turning towards video ads as its once-hot Web portal and email service lag those of rivals such as Google Inc . It bought automated advertising service BrightRoll for $640 million in November, saying the deal would make its video ad platform the largest in the United States.The Oct. 25 game will also be telecast in the Buffalo (WIVB-TV) and Jacksonville (WTEV-TV) markets.A decision on whether the NFL will partner with streaming service providers for future games has not been made, spokesman Alex Reithmiller said.""This is a first step ... taking this first step is a signal that there will probably be other steps to come,"" he said.

293,"   By Abhirup Roy and Kshitiz Goliya  Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) forecast lower-than-expected revenue for the current quarter as it struggles to revive its core online advertising business and spends more to attract users to its websites.Shares of Yahoo were marginally down at $39.34 in after-market trading.Yahoo has been developing content for its mobile platform to drive user engagement and ad sales as its core online advertising business struggles in the face of stiff competition from Google Inc (GOOGL.O) and Facebook Inc (FB.O).Traffic acquisition costs (TAC), the amount Yahoo spends to attract users to Yahoo websites, rose to $200.2 million in the second quarter ended June 30, from $43.8 million a year earlier.Total revenue, after deducting fees paid to partner websites, was flat at $1.04 billion.Chief Financial Officer Ken Goldman said the company expects TAC to grow for the next few quarters.

309,"   By Arathy S Nair and Lehar Maan | July 29  July 29 Selling itself could be one of the few options left for Yelp Inc, which is struggling to win advertising dollars in an increasingly crowded market that already includes Google Inc, TripAdvisor Inc  and GrubHub Inc.Yelp, owner of consumer review website Yelp.com, reported a second-quarter loss on Tuesday and forecast revenue for the current quarter that was far below expectations.The news pushed down the company's shares almost 30 percent on Wednesday to their lowest in more than two years, wiping out more than $735 million in market value.As of Tuesday's close, Yelp - now valued at about $1.8 billion - had already lost 39 percent of its value this year.Unless Yelp can come up with a strategy to boost its financial performance, the San Francisco-based company should consider selling itself, several analysts said.Yelp put itself up for sale in May but then decided not to proceed, Bloomberg reported this month. Yahoo Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Priceline Group Inc would be possible buyers, analysts said.Yelp declined to comment. Yahoo, Amazon and Google did not respond to request for comment, while Priceline said it did not comment on acquisition rumors.""... A Google competitor interested in an advanced local position could view Yelp as an attractive strategic alternative,"" Evercore analyst Ken Sena said in a client note. VALUABLE CONTENT Yahoo in particular would be a good fit, according to Brean Capital's Tom Forte and Piper Jaffray's Gene Munster.""When I think about Yahoo ... I think Yelp checks a handful of boxes,"" Forte told Reuters, noting Yahoo's push into local markets and mobile advertising - an area where Yelp is strong. Barclays analyst Christopher Merwin was skeptical, though, saying Yelp would be ""an awfully big acquisition"" for Yahoo.Yelp's website and mobile app allow users to rate a variety of local businesses, including restaurants and home services.""The content that they have is very valuable and it would be attractive to a lot of players in the advertising space,"" said an investor in the company, who declined to be named.Yelp, which has been profitable in only three of 13 quarters since it went public in March 2012, could also attract activist shareholders, the investor said.""I would say that holding management accountable for financial performance ... is something that the entire Street would welcome. It's not okay just to grow, you have to grow and deliver profits,"" the investor said.Analysts had expected Yelp to post a small profit in the second quarter. Instead, it posted a small loss.

The federal Hart-Scott-Rodino Act exempts investors who buy up to 10 percent of a company's voting securities from disclosing purchases made only for investment purposes.U.S. regulators, however, said Third Point amassed Yahoo shares in August and September 2011 with an eye toward finding a new chief executive or taking one or more board seats, including through a proxy battle if needed.Regulators said Third Point began buying its shares on Aug. 8, 2011, and crossed the threshold for seeking HSR clearance two days later. They said Third Point did not file for such clearance until Sept. 16, 2011. Loeb ultimately engineered the installation of current Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer to replace Carol Bartz.He also won a board seat, which he relinquished in July 2013 when Third Point sold 40 million Yahoo shares to the Sunnyvale, California-based company at a large profit.Led by Chairwoman Edith Ramirez, the FTC majority found a ""significant public interest"" in ensuring that investors follow HSR rules that are enforced consistently and transparently.

342,"   By Lehar Maan  Yahoo Inc said on Tuesday it had signed a search advertising deal with Google Inc, providing a potential boost to Marissa Mayer's efforts to turn around the company, which also reported revenue and profit that fell short of market estimates.The deal with Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc, builds on an existing search partnership Microsoft Corp under which Yahoo gets a percentage of revenue from ads displayed on its sites.Yahoo, whose shares were down 1.6 percent in after-hours trading, said the companies have agreed to delay implementation of the deal in the United States to allow the antitrust division of the Department of Justice to review it.Yahoo has been struggling to boost revenue from ad sales in the face of stiff competition from Google and Facebook.The Google deal was one of the few bright spots included in the company's third-quarter results statement.Yahoo said it expected fourth-quarter revenue of $1.16 billion–$1.20 billion, well below the average analyst estimate of $1.33 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Mayer, in her fourth year as chief executive, said the forecast was ""not indicative of the performance we want."" ""We are also experiencing continued revenue headwinds in our core (advertising) business, especially in the legacy portions,"" Mayer said on a call with analysts.MAVENS PERFORM Yahoo said the proposed spinoff of its 15 percent stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd - a key issue for shareholders - may now close in January. Yahoo earlier this year sought a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service to confirm whether the transaction,  worth about $27 billion currently, would result in a tax obligation. The tax agency denied the request, but Yahoo said it would go ahead with the spinoff by year-end anyway.Many analysts attribute little value to Yahoo's core business without its Asian assets, which also include a 35 percent stake in Yahoo Japan Corp.Apart from the Google deal, the only other good news came results came from Yahoo's emerging businesses, which Mayer calls Mavens - mobile, video, native and social advertising.Revenue in that area rose 43 percent to $422 million in the quarter. Native advertising refers to ads that blend into the type and style of the content being viewed. Excluding items, the company earned 15 cents per share, missing the average analyst estimate of 17 cents.Revenue after deducting fees paid to partner websites fell to $1.0 billion from $1.09 billion, and the company forecast a drop to $920 million-$960 million in the current quarter.Traffic acquisition costs, the amount Yahoo spends to attract users to its websites, jumped to $223 million in the quarter from $54 million a year earlier.GAAP revenue rose 6.8 percent to $1.23 billion, falling short of the average analyst estimate of $1.26 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Through Tuesday's close of $32.83, Yahoo's shares had lost 35 percent this year.

345,"  (New throughout, adds comments from media buyers)By Jessica Toonkel and Lisa RichwineOct 26 The reach of Yahoo Inc's first global live-stream of a  National Football League game on Sunday is likely to result in the league striking future deals with online distributors, media buyers said on Monday.About 15.2 million viewers worldwide watched at least part of the Jacksonville Jaguars' 34-31 victory over the Buffalo Bills in London on Sunday. An average of 2.36 million viewers were watching at any given time, according to preliminary data released by Yahoo and the NFL. About one-third of the viewership came from outside the United States, they said.Nationwide broadcasts of Thursday night games on CBS and NBC's Sunday night games average more than 20 million U.S. viewers per minute, according to Nielsen TV data. The Yahoo data was compiled using different methods than Nielsen. Games from London are broadcast during early morning hours in the United States, and typically attract smaller audiences than regular NFL games.In some cases, the stream of the game in London automatically started playing on Yahoo websites. Those streams counted if they played for more than three seconds. About two-thirds of viewership was in the United States, where the game began at 9:30 a.m. Eastern time (1330 GMT).               (bit.ly/1iVXhTw) Yahoo had guaranteed advertisers 3.5 million viewers in the United States, media buyers told Reuters last week, though it was unclear if that guarantee specified a minimum viewership for the entire game. Over the past few months, Yahoo dropped its asking price for advertisements during the game from $200,000 to less than $100,000, the buyers said. Ad slots were sold out.Still, media buyers said the game's overall viewership and the participation of more than 30 advertisers signaled a success. ""This was definitely a proof of concept and I do think we will see more of it,"" said Gian LaVecchia, managing partner, digital content at MEC, North America.While TV networks have locked up rights to other Sunday games through the 2022 season in multibillion-dollar contracts, digital distributors could bid on next season's Thursday night games, or the NFL could sell rights for the handful of games played overseas each season. CBS has a one-year contract with the NFL for the Thursday games.As the NFL goes into contract negotiations, ""they can say 'there are other places we can go to monetize our audience,'"" said Barry Lowenthal, president of The Media Kitchen, a New York-based media buyer.Final audience figures for the Yahoo game will grow once the NFL adds television viewership from local U.S. markets and digital numbers from China.

""Mobile is the trend and Alibaba is capturing that trend,"" said T.H. Capital Research analyst Tian Hou. Alibaba's New York-listed shares were up 6 percent in morning trade.The company wrung out higher-than-expected revenue growth of 32 percent year-on-year, even as gross merchandise volume (GMV), the total value of goods transacted across its platforms, sank to its slowest annual growth rate in more than three years.The group now faces a conundrum - despite executives' reassurances, there is evidence consumption in China is being affected as the country's economy heads for its slowest full-year growth in a quarter of a century. Alibaba is trying to replace decelerating volume growth in online shopping with new kinds of online buying, mirrored in its latest investments. During the quarter, Alibaba for instance invested $4.6 billion in Suning Commerce Group Co Ltd .It also offered $3.5 billion to become sole owner of Youku Tudou Inc, known as China's YouTube. Online video users in the country are beginning to cough up money for high-quality online streaming services. But the majority of Alibaba's revenue still come from China's online shoppers buying from domestic businesses, a business driven by growth in GMV.For the latest quarter, growth came mostly from Tmall, an Amazon-like website allowing business to sell to customers, where GMV rose 56 percent. Gains at Taobao, more akin to eBay and by far the company's biggest contributor to GMV, showed signs of slowing at just 15 percent.That prompted analysts to ask Alibaba executives if focus was shifting from Taobao, yet executives gave little away on that point.Alibaba's revenue rose to $3.49 billion in the three months ended Sept. 30, beating the average analyst estimate of $3.44 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net income attributable to shareholders reached $3.58 billion, or $1.40 per share. Excluding items, Alibaba earned 57 cents per share, beating the average estimate of 54 cents.

352,"   By Devika  Krishna Kumar and Lehar Maan  Activist investor Starboard Value LP asked Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) to drop plans to spin off its stake in Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd (BABA.N) due to tax concerns, and instead urged the company to sell its core search and display advertising businesses.Yahoo's current net cash holding and the funds raised from a sale of the business could be returned to shareholders through buybacks and dividends, Jeff Smith, Starboard's head, said in a letter to Yahoo on Thursday.The hedge fund, calling itself a ""significant shareholder"" in Yahoo, said it made the letter public as its efforts to talk to the company privately over the past year had not borne fruit.Starboard had supported the planned spinoff of the Alibaba stake, currently worth about $30 billion, before the U.S. Internal Revenue Service in September denied Yahoo's request for a private letter ruling on whether the transaction would be tax free.Yahoo's shareholders could end up paying roughly $12 billion in taxes if the IRS deems the transaction taxable after the spinoff, expected to close by end-December. Yahoo was worth about $31 billion as of Wednesday's close. ""If you stay on the current path, we believe the potential penalty for being wrong is just too great, and the potential reward for being right is not materially better than the other alternative,"" Smith said.Yahoo declined to comment. Yahoo shares rose as much as 1.6 percent, but were flat at midday. Alibaba was up 1.4 percent.Starboard said Yahoo had snubbed its requests to appoint Smith as a board member at least four times in the last four months. Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser said Yahoo shareholders would likely back Starboard over the company's board if a proxy fight ensued.""It wouldn't be a very hard proxy fight for Starboard.""Yahoo's search and display ad businesses, which account for a lions shares of total revenue, has been struggling and Chief Executive Marissa Mayer's efforts to revive the business have yielded little results.

The hedge fund, calling itself a ""significant shareholder"" in Yahoo, said it made the letter public as its efforts to talk to the company privately over the past year had not borne fruit.Starboard had supported the planned spinoff of the Alibaba stake, currently worth about $30 billion, before the U.S. Internal Revenue Service in September denied Yahoo's request for a private letter ruling on whether the transaction would be tax free.Yahoo's shareholders could end up paying roughly $12 billion in taxes if the IRS deems the transaction taxable after the spinoff, expected to close by end-December. Yahoo was worth about $31 billion as of Wednesday's close.""If you stay on the current path, we believe the potential penalty for being wrong is just too great, and the potential reward for being right is not materially better than the other alternative,"" Smith said. Yahoo declined to comment. Yahoo shares rose as much as 1.6 percent, but were flat at midday. Alibaba was up 1.4 percent.Starboard said Yahoo had snubbed its requests to appoint Smith as a board member at least four times in the last four months.Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser said Yahoo shareholders would likely back Starboard over the company's board if a proxy fight ensued.

360,"   By Rodrigo Campos | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Investors who made early bets on Marissa Mayer's ability to turn around Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) were well rewarded for their faith: the share price has more than doubled and widely outperformed the broader stock market since she took over as president and CEO in July 2012.But those still betting on her may have lingered too long as the stock nearly halved from November 2014 to last September. Much of the long upward trajectory was funded by an aggressive share buyback program and its stakes in Alibaba Group (BABA.N) and Yahoo Japan (4689.T).The board of Yahoo is weighing a sale of its core Internet business when it meets this week amid a broader debate about the future of the company and that of high-profile Mayer.Yahoo's stock closed at $15.64 when Mayer was appointed president and chief executive on July 16, 2012. The gains to Tuesday's close, of more than 115 percent, widely outperform gains in the S&P 500 .SPX, up 55 percent since, the Nasdaq 100 .NDX, up 83 percent and even Apple Inc (AAPL.O), which has gained 35 percent in the same period.The company's market capitalization, however, has grown about 66 percent under Mayer. The difference is attributable to a decline in shares outstanding as Yahoo has bought back roughly $8.3 billion worth of its stock since the third quarter of 2012, according to Reuters data. Despite the share price doubling under her tenure, the current level, around $35 was hit in November 2013, less than a year and a half after Mayer took over.""It is clear that time is running out for the current management and they are trying to come up with an alternative. They still haven’t resolved the long-term issue of what Yahoo will be going forward,” said Skip Aylesworth, portfolio manager of the Henessy Technology fund.Aylesworth, who does not currently own shares of Yahoo, sold his fund’s stake in the company approximately a year and a half into Mayer’s tenure as chief executive after the company’s revenue and earnings metrics did not significantly improve, he said. The rally during Mayer's tenure got support from the stakes in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan. But less than half of its market cap is attributable to Yahoo's own business, according to a Thomson Reuters Breakingviews calculator.To see the calculator click on j.mp/YHOOcalcThe company's stake in Yahoo Japan is held at a 30 percent discount off its actual market value, while its Alibaba stake is held at about a 59 percent discount. ""This is an undervalued company if you do a sum of the parts sort of thing, it doesn’t take a whole lot of imagination to see what could be coming,"" said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst, Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.Yahoo plans to spin off its Alibaba stake into a public company along with Yahoo Small Business that provides domain names and local marketing.Yahoo's stock was up 6.9 percent at $36.04 in early afternoon trading on Wednesday.

365,"  (Adds comments, updates prices)By Rodrigo CamposNEW YORK Dec 2 Investors who made early bets on Marissa Mayer's ability to turn around Yahoo Inc were well rewarded for their faith: the share price has more than doubled and widely outperformed the broader stock market since she took over as president and CEO in July 2012.But those still betting on her may have lingered too long as the stock nearly halved from November 2014 to last September. Much of the long upward trajectory was funded by an aggressive share buyback program and its stakes in Alibaba Group  and Yahoo Japan.The board of Yahoo is weighing a sale of its core Internet business when it meets this week amid a broader debate about the future of the company and that of high-profile Mayer.Yahoo's stock closed at $15.64 when Mayer was appointed president and chief executive on July 16, 2012. The gains to Tuesday's close, of more than 115 percent, widely outperform gains in the S&P 500, up 55 percent since, the Nasdaq 100 , up 83 percent and even Apple Inc, which has gained 35 percent in the same period. The company's market capitalization, however, has grown about 66 percent under Mayer. The difference is attributable to a decline in shares outstanding as Yahoo has bought back roughly $8.3 billion worth of its stock since the third quarter of 2012, according to Reuters data.Despite the share price doubling under her tenure, the current level, around $35 was hit in November 2013, less than a year and a half after Mayer took over.""It is clear that time is running out for the current management and they are trying to come up with an alternative. They still haven't resolved the long-term issue of what Yahoo will be going forward,"" said Skip Aylesworth, portfolio manager of the Henessy Technology fund. Aylesworth, who does not currently own shares of Yahoo, sold his fund's stake in the company approximately a year and a half into Mayer's tenure as chief executive after the company's revenue and earnings metrics did not significantly improve, he said.The rally during Mayer's tenure got support from the stakes in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan. But less than half of its market cap is attributable to Yahoo's own business, according to a Thomson Reuters Breakingviews calculator.To see the calculator click on j.mp/YHOOcalc The company's stake in Yahoo Japan is held at a 30 percent discount off its actual market value, while its Alibaba stake is held at about a 59 percent discount.""This is an undervalued company if you do a sum of the parts sort of thing, it doesn't take a whole lot of imagination to see what could be coming,"" said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst, Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.Yahoo plans to spin off its Alibaba stake into a public company along with Yahoo Small Business that provides domain names and local marketing.Yahoo's stock was up 6.9 percent at $36.04 in early afternoon trading on Wednesday.(Additional reporting by Chuck mikolajczak and David Randall; Editing by Richard Chang and Bernard Orr)",2015-12-02,YHOO,"Wed Dec 2, 2015 | 12:32pm EST","UPDATE 1-With buyback help, Yahoo stock has soared under Mayer",http://www.reuters.com//article/yahoo-divestiture-stock-idUSL1N13R1MU20151202?type=companyNews
366,"  (Adds confirmation of possible sale by Reuters, updates stock price)SAN FRANCISCO/BENGALURU Dec 1 The board of Yahoo Inc is weighing a sale of its core Internet business when it meets this week, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.The board's meeting comes amid a broader debate about the future of the company and that of high-profile Chief Executive Marissa Mayer.The Wall Street Journal first reported the possible sale of the Internet business late on Tuesday. People familiar with the matter told the newspaper the board was expected to also discuss during meetings from Wednesday through Friday whether to proceed with a plan to spin off more than $30 billion in shares of Alibaba Holding Group Ltd. The company could also pursue both options, the paper said.The company's shares were up more than 7 percent in extended trading.Yahoo's core business, which includes popular services like Yahoo Mail and its news and sports sites, could attract private equity firms, media and telecom companies or firms like Softbank Group Corp, analysts have said in the past. Yahoo declined to comment on the report.The news comes as Mayer faces growing pressure over the company's performance. Mayer came to Yahoo after a long stint at Google. Her arrival kicked off heightened expectations of a quick turnaround at Yahoo, which had struggled to grow its advertising business to compete with market leaders Google and Facebook.Hopes of a comeback crumbled as Yahoo's plan to push mobile, video, native and social media ads - a strategy Mayer introduced in 2014 under the acronym Mavens - failed to increase revenues as desktop search ads continued to decline.A $1.1 billion deal in 2013 to acquire social blogging site Tumblr also hit snags, with investors arguing that Mayer overpaid for an unprofitable product. The deal lifted Yahoo's user base to about 1 billion but did not bring in advertisers. In September, Yahoo's plans for the spinoff of its stake in Alibaba hit a roadblock when the U.S. Internal Revenue Service denied a request to bless the transaction as a tax-free deal.Yahoo said it planned to proceed with the spinoff despite the IRS announcement, but has not yet done so.In November, activist investor Starboard Value LP asked Yahoo to drop plans to spin off its stake in Alibaba and urged the company to sell its core search and display advertising businesses instead.During Mayer's 13-year tenure at Google, she led the Google Earth, Gmail and Google News teams and is credited with helping create the company's celebrated search page.

375,"   By Deborah M. Todd | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Yahoo Inc's board of directors on Friday is in the third and final day of meetings that could decide the future of one of Silicon Valley's most prominent but troubled companies.One option on the table for the nine board members is whether to sell Yahoo's core business, which includes Mail, its sports sites, and advertising technology.The company is also in the process of deciding whether to continue with the spinoff of its $30 billion stake in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd.SunTrust analyst Robert Peck said the board might hold off on any decision because of the complexity of some of the options.""While many investors may simply apply a mid single-digit EBITDA multiple to value the core, we believe the value is more intricate,"" he wrote, referring to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.According to tech news site Re/Code, Yahoo's board finished its meetings without a decision on the Alibaba spinoff. The site said a decision, which could include halting, delaying or continuing with the spinoff, was expected by the end of the weekend, citing sources. Calls to sell the core business increased last month when activist investor Starboard Value LP requested the move to avoid potential tax penalties associated with a spinoff of Alibaba.In January, Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer announced the plan to spin off the Alibaba stake into an independent business. Yahoo said the deal would be tax-free, but the U.S. Internal Revenue Service has declined to verify that.Taxes related to the spinoff could leave Yahoo shareholders on the hook for $12 billion. Analysts who follow the company have said that private equity, media and Internet firms are potential buyers for Yahoo's core business.The Alibaba stake dates back to 2005, when Yahoo paid $1 billion for a 40 percent slice of the company in a deal credited to the U.S. company's co-founder, Jerry Yang.

379,"  SAN FRANCISCO/BENGALURU An activist investor on Thursday renewed its push for Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) to abandon its plans to spin off its valuable stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) and instead sell its core business ""at the highest price possible.""The pressure from Starboard Value LP came as Yahoo's board, in a three-day meeting that started on Wednesday, was reportedly weighing a number of options for the troubled company.That includes selling the core business, a source told Reuters, encompassing features like Mail, its news site and other Web services.Alibaba, seen by some as a potential buyer, is unlikely to be interested, according to the Wall Street Journal. Citing a person familiar with the matter, the Journal said Alibaba felt the core business is not attractive, ""given the difficulties successive managers have had in turning it around.""Yahoo's board, which includes co-founder David Filo, Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) former Chief Executive H. Lee Scott Jr. and Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW.N) Chairman Charles R. Schwab, was also expected to discuss the planned spinoff of Yahoo's 15 percent stake in Alibaba.Alibaba will be interested in buying back its shares from Yahoo only at a steep discount, the WSJ said, citing the person.  After earlier urging the company to spin off the Alibaba stake, Starboard reversed course. It had first urged the sale of the core business in a November letter to Yahoo. It is unclear what the board's decision will mean for the future of Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer, who has pushed for the spin-off of the Alibaba stake but has not publicly commented on the possible sale of the core business. Yahoo shareholders could end up paying billions in taxes if the U.S. Internal Revenue Service deems a spin-off taxable. The company had sought a private letter ruling from the IRS to confirm a spin-off would be tax-free, but the agency denied the request in September.The board is ""seriously considering"" pausing on a spin-off until there is more clarity on the tax implications, Re/code reported, citing sources.Yahoo had earlier planned to complete an Alibaba spinoff by the end of December. But the company said in October the transaction was expected to close in January. Alibaba and Yahoo did not respond to requests for comment.Yahoo's shares were down more than 4 percent in afternoon trading, and Alibaba was down more than 3 percent.

401,"  SAN FRANCISCO/BENGALURU Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) is weighing a sale of its core Internet business and will not sell its stake in Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N), CNBC reported, with an announcement coming as soon Wednesday. The moves represent a stark rejection of Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer's plan to sell the $30 billion Alibaba stake and to revive Yahoo's core Internet unit focusing on growing mobile, video and social media ads. Yahoo could not immediately be reached for comment. Its shares rose more than 2 percent in after-hours trading. Alibaba's shares rose 1.3 percent.Yahoo's core business consists of selling search and display ads on its popular news and sports sites, email service and products like Tumblr.Yahoo is also considering what to do with its stake in Yahoo Japan (4689.T), according to the CNBC report. Yahoo owns 35 percent of that company, worth about $8.5 billion at current exchange rates.The CNBC report on Tuesday, which cited unnamed sources, did not disclose a possible sale price for the core Internet unit. Analysts and bankers have estimated it could fetch between $2 billion and $8 billion, with many seeing $4 billion as the likely price, but some regard its value as less than zero.The CNBC report indicated the sale process could take a year or more. But one analyst, Robert Peck with SunTrust, said he expected the company to expedite the process. Three to six months is reasonable, he said, ""depending on who acquires it."" After such a sale, all that would be left, essentially, would be the Alibaba and Yahoo Japan stakes.“This is absolutely a step in the right direction,"" said Neil Doshi, an analyst at Mizuho Securities USA. ""We’d much rather see Yahoo either spin off or potentially sell the core and have a tax liability on a smaller piece than have it on the larger Alibaba piece.” Private equity, media and Internet firms are potential buyers. On Monday, the chief financial officer of Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) said the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier could look at buying Yahoo's core business, but made no mention of a price. AN END TO TECH ROLE The latest report followed a three-day meeting of Yahoo's board of directors last week, which concluded on Friday. Yahoo has faced pressure from activist investor Starboard Value LP to sell the core business rather than proceed with the planned spin-off of its stake in Alibaba, which could trigger large tax payments.In January, announcing the Alibaba plan, Mayer said the deal would be tax-free, but the U.S. Internal Revenue Service has declined to verify that. Taxes related to the spin-off could leave Yahoo shareholders on the hook for $12 billion. ""This was really a really good PR move by Starboard as the spinoff was highly unlikely anyway given the tax implications and they knew they could claim victory once Yahoo made the official announcement,” said Jim Osman of The Edge Consulting Group, a research firm that advises activist hedge funds.  The sale of the company's core Internet business would effectively end Yahoo's role as a key U.S. tech company and be a recognition that Mayer's efforts to revive the businesses have yielded few results.But Doshi, of Mizuho Securities, said that was not necessarily a defeat for Mayer.“This is a potential win-win for Marissa,"" Doshi said.

402,"  (Adds detail from CNBC report, analyst comment on timing of sale of core business)SAN FRANCISCO/BENGALURU Dec 8 Yahoo Inc  is weighing a sale of its core Internet business and will not sell its stake in Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, CNBC reported, with an announcement coming as soon Wednesday.The moves represent a stark rejection of Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer's plan to sell the $30 billion Alibaba stake and to revive Yahoo's core Internet unit focusing on growing mobile, video and social media ads.Yahoo could not immediately be reached for comment. Its shares rose more than 2 percent in after-hours trading. Alibaba's shares rose 1.3 percent.Yahoo's core business consists of selling search and display ads on its popular news and sports sites, email service and products like Tumblr.Yahoo is also considering what to do with its stake in Yahoo Japan, according to the CNBC report. Yahoo owns 35 percent of that company, worth about $8.5 billion at current exchange rates.The CNBC report on Tuesday, which cited unnamed sources, did not disclose a possible sale price for the core Internet unit. Analysts and bankers have estimated it could fetch between $2 billion and $8 billion, with many seeing $4 billion as the likely price, but some regard its value as less than zero. The CNBC report indicated the sale process could take a year or more. But one analyst, Robert Peck with SunTrust, said he expected the company to expedite the process. Three to six months is reasonable, he said, ""depending on who acquires it.""After such a sale, all that would be left, essentially, would be the Alibaba and Yahoo Japan stakes.""This is absolutely a step in the right direction,"" said Neil Doshi, an analyst at Mizuho Securities USA. ""We'd much rather see Yahoo either spin off or potentially sell the core and have a tax liability on a smaller piece than have it on the larger Alibaba piece."" Private equity, media and Internet firms are potential buyers. On Monday, the chief financial officer of Verizon Communications Inc said the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier could look at buying Yahoo's core business, but made no mention of a price.AN END TO TECH ROLE  The latest report followed a three-day meeting of Yahoo's board of directors last week, which concluded on Friday. Yahoo has faced pressure from activist investor Starboard Value LP to sell the core business rather than proceed with the planned spin-off of its stake in Alibaba, which could trigger large tax payments.In January, announcing the Alibaba plan, Mayer said the deal would be tax-free, but the U.S. Internal Revenue Service has declined to verify that. Taxes related to the spin-off could leave Yahoo shareholders on the hook for $12 billion.""This was really a really good PR move by Starboard as the spinoff was highly unlikely anyway given the tax implications and they knew they could claim victory once Yahoo made the official announcement,"" said Jim Osman of The Edge Consulting Group, a research firm that advises activist hedge funds.The sale of the company's core Internet business would effectively end Yahoo's role as a key U.S. tech company and be a recognition that Mayer's efforts to revive the businesses have yielded few results.But Doshi, of Mizuho Securities, said that was not necessarily a defeat for Mayer.""This is a potential win-win for Marissa,"" Doshi said. ""She can sell the company and have a graceful exit or she can be part of a larger company or private equity team and still continue to run the business.""

411,"   By Megan Twohey | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Dec 18 A woman who used the Internet to take in unwanted adopted children faces years in prison after a federal jury convicted her Friday on charges of kidnapping and transporting a minor across state lines for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity.The woman, Nicole Eason, 37, was charged after a 2013 Reuters investigation exposed an illicit network where parents offered children they no longer wanted to strangers they met online. Eason's husband, Calvin, 46, pleaded guilty last month to the same charges.Through a practice called private re-homing, the Easons had taken custody of at least six boys and girls from 2006 through 2009, lying about their identities to the children's adoptive parents. Reuters found other examples of re-homing across the United States, with no government oversight and at great risk to children.The news agency revealed that the Easons had created fictitious credentials. They never disclosed that Nicole Eason's biological children had been permanently removed from their custody years earlier, after social workers concluded the couple had neglected one child and physically abused the other. As a result of the Reuters investigation, federal authorities arrested the Easons in Arizona last spring. They were charged in U.S. District Court in Illinois with kidnapping two of the girls that they took in through re-homing - one in 2007 and the other in 2008. They also were charged with taking one of the girls across state lines with the intent to engage her in sexual activity.The girl, who turned 8 while she was in the custody of the Easons, told authorities that both Calvin and Nicole molested and physically abused her. The other victim said she was expected to sleep next to a naked Nicole Eason but was not molested. In both cases, the parents who transferred custody of the children to the Easons had connected with Nicole Eason through Yahoo groups. Parents used the online bulletin boards to discuss their difficulties caring for children they had adopted, and Reuters also found many cases in which parents sought to offload those children to strangers. During a five-year period, Reuters found that on a single Yahoo group, a child was advertised for re-homing on average once a week.Yahoo removed the message boards after the news agency brought them to the company's attention. Living in Illinois at the time, the Easons presented themselves as a loving, stable family, dedicated to the well-being of children in their care. In reality, they had lost custody of both of their biological children. After authorities had removed their second child, a newborn, a sheriff's deputy wrote in his report that the Easons ""have severe psychiatric problems as well as violent tendencies.""No U.S. federal law specifically prohibits re-homing, and Reuters found that state laws restricting custody transfers and advertising of children rarely prescribe criminal sanctions and are frequently ignored.In response to the Reuters investigation, at least six states have passed new restrictions on advertising children, transferring custody, or both.

417,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Yahoo Inc was ordered by a Chicago federal judge on Monday to face a class action lawsuit accusing the Internet company of sending unsolicited text messages to Sprint Corp cellphone users in violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.U.S. District Judge Manish Shah said the users could sue as a group over messages sent in March 2013 because their claims had enough in common.Shah rejected Yahoo's arguments that a class action could subject it to damages that were disproportionate to the alleged harm, promote ""piecemeal"" litigation covering other time periods and phone carriers, and thwart Congress' desire that claims be brought individually in small claims court.More than 500,000 cellphone users could be part of the class, court papers show. The plaintiffs accused Yahoo of sending them automated ""welcome"" messages when other users sent them separate messages via the Yahoo Messenger service.They said the welcome messages constituted unauthorized advertising for Yahoo services, violating the federal TCPA and subjecting the Sunnyvale, California-based company to damages of up to $1,500 per message if the violations were willful.The case was brought by Rachel Johnson, an Illinois resident who claimed to receive a welcome message from Yahoo after being sent a spam text message from another user advertising a means to reduce high-cost debt.

431,"   By Liana B. Baker  A vocal investor in Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) and Viacom Inc (VIAB.O) is calling for the boards of both companies to seek outside investments from strategic partners in the vein of legendary investor Warren Buffett to help boost the value of their stocks. In an article reviewed by Reuters that is to be published on the Internet on Thursday, New York-based SpringOwl Asset Management managing director Eric Jackson said Yahoo and Viacom would benefit from outside investment, and pointed to Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N) weathering the financial crisis after taking on a $5 billion investment from Warren Buffett in 2008. SpringOwl holds undisclosed stakes in Yahoo and Viacom. ""Although some shareholders of both Yahoo and Viacom think that a simple sale or break-up of both companies is the best way to create value for shareholders, we believe that both companies could benefit from their own version of the ""Buffett Convert,"" Jackson said.Jackson said that while the stakes of investors would be diluted if an outside investor stepped in, ""they would still be better off because their shares would likely get re-rated upwards substantially with this new partner sitting around the board table."" Yahoo and Viacom declined to comment.Both Yahoo and Viacom have become targets of activist shareholders. Yahoo has been under pressure to separate its Asian assets and auction off its core business. Its shares have fallen about 40 percent over the last year.Viacom is the subject of a lawsuit claiming that its executive chairman, Sumner Redstone, is incapacitated.According to Jackson, Yahoo should turn to Liberty Media Corp (LMCA.O), whose chairman John Malone is a whiz at finding tax efficiencies, or telecommunications companies Verizon (VZ.N) or AT&T (T.N), which could also bring traffic to Yahoo's properties.  For Viacom, it could benefit from investment and insight from China's Alibaba (BABA.N), Amazon (AMZN.O) or AMC Entertainment holdings, he said. Jackson has previously suggested that Viacom consider a merger with AMC.Jackson added that Paramount, the movie studio owned by Viacom, could become more valuable to investors if Amazon, Alibaba, Apple or Google invested.

Yahoo's core Internet business has struggled, and CEO Marissa Mayer has signaled she might put the business up for sale.Andy Serwer, Yahoo Finance's editor in chief, told CNBC that Yahoo could sell ads for the live stream, and said Buffett had called him in December to ask if a webcast was possible.""He said, 'I just want to make it bigger,'"" Serwer said. ""There's a lot of demand, particularly in places like China."" Yahoo shares closed up $2.24, or 8.3 percent, at $29.28.Berkshire owns nearly 90 businesses, among which are BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream, Fruit of the Loom underwear, Geico car insurance and See's candies. Most are in the United States, and the webcast could help Buffett market Berkshire to sellers of businesses elsewhere.Last year's annual meeting drew roughly 40,000 people to Omaha to celebrate Buffett's 50th anniversary at the helm. Attendance began to swell after Berkshire created lower-priced ""B"" shares in 1996, which increased the number of investors in the company.The planned webcast was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. But even with the webcast, traveling to Omaha for Buffett's ""Woodstock for Capitalists"" offers distinctive opportunities. Shareholders get discounts from Berkshire businesses and may also participate in a five-kilometer run or dine at Gorat's steak house, a Buffett favorite.It is unclear how the webcast might affect tourism in Omaha, where Berkshire's annual meeting is the biggest tourist draw other than the College World Series of baseball.Air fares soar and hotel rates typically double or triple.

451,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) plans to webcast its annual meeting for the first time, allowing the largest U.S. shareholder gathering to reach a global audience through Yahoo Inc's (YHOO.O) finance page.Viewers will be able to watch Buffett, Berkshire's 85-year-old chief executive officer, and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 92, field five hours of questions on April 30 from shareholders, reporters and analysts about the Omaha, Nebraska-based company, investing, the economy and life.The webcast offers a chance ""to reach more people than ever, in key financial centers"" and ""to bring the energy and excitement of what happens in Omaha to an informed audience around the world,"" Buffett, known as the ""oracle of Omaha,"" said in a statement on Tuesday.The webcast may help Yahoo attract advertisers enticed by millions of potential online viewers. Yahoo's core Internet business has struggled, and CEO Marissa Mayer has signaled she might put the business up for sale.Andy Serwer, Yahoo Finance's editor in chief, told CNBC that Yahoo could sell ads for the live stream, and said Buffett had called him in December to ask if a webcast was possible.""He said, 'I just want to make it bigger,'"" Serwer said. ""There's a lot of demand, particularly in places like China."" Yahoo shares closed up $2.24, or 8.3 percent, at $29.28.Berkshire owns nearly 90 businesses, among which are BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream, Fruit of the Loom underwear, Geico car insurance and See's candies. Most are in the United States, and the webcast could help Buffett market Berkshire to sellers of businesses elsewhere.Last year's annual meeting drew roughly 40,000 people to Omaha to celebrate Buffett's 50th anniversary at the helm. Attendance began to swell after Berkshire created lower-priced ""B"" shares in 1996, which increased the number of investors in the company.The planned webcast was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. But even with the webcast, traveling to Omaha for Buffett's ""Woodstock for Capitalists"" offers distinctive opportunities. Shareholders get discounts from Berkshire businesses and may also participate in a five-kilometer run or dine at Gorat's steak house, a Buffett favorite.It is unclear how the webcast might affect tourism in Omaha, where Berkshire's annual meeting is the biggest tourist draw other than the College World Series of baseball.Air fares soar and hotel rates typically double or triple.

Senator Investment Group also exited its position, selling 500,000.VALEANT PHARMACEUTICALS INTERNATIONAL INC The embattled drug maker, whose stock price tumbled last year amid questions about accounting and business practices, also saw a lot of activity. Aaron Cowen's Suvretta, exited its  position of 354,750 shares.  Visium Asset Management sold its position of 1 million shares. But some investors also saw fresh value, and Jana Partners took a new position, buying 1.56 million.

485,"   By Mike Stone and Greg Roumeliotis | March 18  March 18 When Anbang Insurance Group acquired New York's Waldorf Astoria Hotel last year, the Chinese company gained more than one of the city's most iconic buildings. It got a base on Park Avenue across from the office of veteran dealmaker Paul Taubman.This move made it easier for Taubman to meet Anbang executives visiting New York and score one of his investment banking boutique PJT Partners Inc's biggest victories: becoming sole buyside financial adviser to the largest ever acquisition of a U.S. company by a Chinese firm, people familiar with the matter said.PJT is advising Anbang Insurance Group Co's consortium on its $13.2 billion bid for Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc, which the U.S. company said on Friday is superior to a merger agreement with Marriott International Inc. Marriott has until March 28 to submit a counteroffer.PJT became a public company last year after it was merged with the advisory business of Blackstone Group LP and then spun off. Blackstone has carried out several real estate transactions with Anbang, including selling the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York for $1.95 billion and its Strategic Hotels portfolio for $6.5 billion. PJT is itself no stranger to Chinese assignments. It is currently advising KFC and Pizza Hut chain owner Yum! Brands Inc's board of directors on spinning off its China business, as well as Yahoo Inc, owner of a minority stake in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd , on its strategic options.PJT refused to comment on the investment banking fee it stood to receive from Anbang, and it is not clear whether the New York-based firm would be paid based on Western practices. ""We estimate that Anbang's fees could be $60 million or so, due to the cross-border regulatory issues they are likely to encounter. Not a bad haul for a firm that just disclosed $286 million in total advisory fees for their fiscal 2015,"" said Jeffrey Nassof, a vice chairman at consulting firm Freeman & Co LLC.Anbang selected PJT because it wanted an investment bank that had not advised any of its rivals in the auction for Starwood, according to people familiar with the matter who requested not to be identified disclosing confidential details. Anbang and its private equity partners in the consortium, J.C. Flowers & Co and Primavera Capital, are financing the cash deal themselves without bank borrowing, so PJT's lack of a balance sheet was not an issue, one of the people added. Anbang declined to comment.Taubman, a former Morgan Stanley investment banker, worked on Anbang's deal alongside PJT partner John Trousdale, a former vice chairman of global M&A and global head of media & telecom M&A at Credit Suisse Group AG, according to the sources.Taubman is no stranger to big deals. Among his previous assignments are Verizon Communication Inc's $130 billion deal to buy out Vodafone's stake in its wireless venture, and Altice NV's $17.7 billion acquisition of the fourth-largest U.S. cable operator, Cablevision Systems Corp.PJT was ranked 29th in the Thomson Reuters M&A leagues table in 2015, advising on $74 billion of transactions, up from 62nd in 2014 on $15.2 billion of transactions.

487,"  (Adds detail on Starboard demands and Yahoo shares, background on hedge fund activist)By Michael Flaherty and Supantha MukherjeeMarch 24 Activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP moved on Thursday to overthrow the entire board of Yahoo Inc , including Chief Executive Marissa Mayer, who has struggled to turn around the company in her nearly four years at the helm.Starboard, which has been pushing for changes at Yahoo since 2014 and owns about 1.7 percent of the company, said it would nominate nine candidates for the board.The proxy fight comes as Yahoo is pressing ahead with an auction of its core Internet business, which includes search, mail and news sites. The faded Internet pioneer has been struggling to keep up with Alphabet Inc's Google and Facebook Inc in the battle for online advertisers.Yahoo said in a statement it will review Starboard's nominees and respond in due course.Yahoo and Starboard could still come to an agreement before the company's annual meeting, expected to be in late June. If they cannot avoid a proxy fight and the Yahoo board election is taken to a shareholder vote, attention will swing to the large mutual and index funds that own the stock and will carry heavy weight in the final tally.""We think everyone getting into the stock over the past six months, and most of those easing their way out, will all side with Starboard,"" said Don Bilson, head of event-driven research at Gordon Haskett, an independent research firm.BlackRock Inc, Vanguard Group, State Street Corp  and Fidelity Investments own a combined 16.2 percent of Yahoo shares, according to Thomson Reuters data, with Goldman Sachs owning another 4.2 percent.Yahoo co-founder David Filo - one of the board members Starboard wants to remove - is the company's largest shareholder with a 7.5-percent stake. Yahoo and Starboard representatives met on March 10 to discuss ways the two sides could avoid a proxy fight, according to people familiar with the matter. But those talks broke down, in part because Starboard was upset by Yahoo's announcement that same day that it appointed two new board directors, these people say.""We have been extremely disappointed with Yahoo's dismal financial performance,"" Starboard said in its latest letter to Yahoo, adding that its need to officially launch a proxy fight was ""unfortunate.""Starboard said it remained open to discussions with Yahoo and was hopeful that it could reach an agreement to get involved with the company.Given that Starboard is proposing nine new directors, a settlement prior to the annual meeting would focus on whether or not Yahoo is willing to give up control of the board.Some Yahoo investors are concerned that a proxy fight could hinder the auction effort, since a buyer would want to know if a stable board and management team is in place before putting in an offer, sources have said. Starboard said in its letter that one reason for its desire to shake up the board is to ensure that the core business is properly sold, adding that it was concerned with how the process was going so far.""The same management team and Board that has failed shareholders for years wants shareholders to entrust them with one of the most crucial decisions yet to be made,"" Starboard founder Jeffrey Smith wrote in the letter, referring to the auction of the core business.Yahoo's shares, which have fallen about 22 percent in the past 12 months, were down 0.9 percent at $34.49 in early trading on Thursday. They were trading around $40 when Starboard first launched its Yahoo campaign, where the hedge fund advocated for Yahoo to merge with AOL, now owned by Verizon.Yahoo launched an auction of its core business in February after it shelved plans to spin off its stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Starboard's nominees include its chief executive, Jeffrey Smith, and Eddy Hartenstein, the former chief executive of Tribune Co; Bridget Baker, NBCUniversal's former president of TV Networks Distribution; and Rick Hill, the former chairman of Tessera Technologies. Hill, who experienced a Starboard attack when he was at Tessera, has served on several of Smith's director slates since.The deadline for shareholders to nominate directors to stand for election at the annual meeting expires on Saturday.Starboard has made clear since January that it is seeking the ouster of Mayer and of board directors, though how many board seats Smith sought was a mystery until news of the slate broke late on Wednesday.The hedge fund interviewed more than 100 candidates for its director slate, according to a person familiar with the matter.A shareholder move to overthrow an entire board is very rare, and even more extraordinary for Starboard given its relatively small ownership of Yahoo's stock.In October 2014, Starboard Value LP won its standoff with Darden Restaurants Inc, convincing shareholders to replace the whole board of the Olive Garden parent.Starboard currently owns 5.2 percent of Darden's stock, and that is after selling a significant amount of shares earlier this month.(Editing by Ted Kerr and Nick Zieminski)",2016-03-24,YHOO,"Thu Mar 24, 2016 | 1:49pm EDT",UPDATE 4-Starboard launches proxy fight to remove entire Yahoo board,http://www.reuters.com//article/yahoo-starboard-idUSL3N16W3LX?type=companyNews

He has experience dealing with large personalities such as Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) CEO Elon Musk, since he serves on the board of Tesla. W. LANCE CONN Conn has connections in both the technology space and the more traditional cable industry. He is close to Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) co-founder Paul Allen from running Allen's investment firm, Vulcan Capital, and also serves on the board of Charter Communications (CHTR.O), which is awaiting approval for its acquisition of Time Warner Cable TWC.N. Through serving on Charter's board, Conn has ties to Liberty Media Corp (LMCA.O) executives John Malone and Greg Maffei, whose digital media company has been speculated to look at investing in Yahoo.DALE FULLER  Fuller is the security expert with stints as interim CEO of McAfee Inc and a current director at antivirus firm AVG Technologies NV (AVG.N), another company that has explored a sales process in the past. EDDY W. HARTENSTEIN Hartenstein has been around the block as a media executive, publisher of the LA Times, former chief executive of Tribune Co and board member of several publicly traded companies. He currently serves on the boards of several technology companies that are in the midst of transformative mergers, such as SanDisk Corp SNDK.O, which is being taken over by Western Digital Corp (WDC.O); Broadcom Ltd (AVGO.O), which is now owned by Avago; and Rovi Corp ROVI.O, which had been reported to be in talks with Tivo Inc (TIVO.O).  RICK HILL Hill has experience in intellectual property as a former chairman of technology designer and licensor Tessera Technologies Inc (TSRA.O), and worked for 20 years at Novellus Systems, a semiconductor company.

Yahoo has said it exploring a sale of non-core patents worth $1 billion to $3 billion.DEBRA JANSSEN Janssen, a financial services executive who is chief operations officer at Bankers Trust, has also has worked at CDS Global, a division of the media company Hearst Corp that provides services to publishers.JEFFREY SMITH Jeffrey Smith is the one who engineered the entire board slate as CEO of Starboard. Smith, who successfully oversaw a proxy fight at Darden Restaurants Inc (DRI.N), will have his work cut out for him at Yahoo, where he has to win over several of Yahoo's large institutional investors plus co-founder David Filo, its largest shareholder with a 7.5 percent stake. This fight comes as Yahoo presses ahead with an auction for its core Internet business. Some Yahoo investors are concerned that a proxy fight would hinder the auction effort, sowing doubts among potential buyers over the stability of Yahoo's board, Reuters has reported.

(1.usa.gov/1RyQU5t)Yahoo joins several companies including Apple Inc (AAPL.O), AT&T Inc (T.N), Staples Inc (SPLS.O) and Citigroup Inc (C.N) in adopting new ""proxy access"" rules that make it easier for shareholders or groups of shareholders to nominate board candidates.""Proxy access"" is shareholders' ability to nominate directors to run against a company's chosen slate of director nominees using its annual meeting materials. Activist investor Starboard Value LP, which owns about 1.7 percent of Yahoo, launched a proxy fight last week to overthrow the company's nine-member board. Yahoo, under pressure from shareholders to sell its core business, began an auction of the business last month after shelving plans to spin off its stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N).Yahoo said on Wednesday that the amended bylaws would come into effect after its 2016 annual meeting, which means they would be effective from the 2017 meeting.

The stock has fallen 18 percent over the past 12 months, but is up 10 percent so far in 2016.More than a half-dozen investors of various sizes and investment strategies contacted by Reuters this week, including an executive at one of Yahoo's 10 largest shareholders, all praised Starboard's move as one that would help provoke necessary changes.Many investors declined to comment, making it hard to determine if Starboard's move would succeed. The shareholders who spoke represent a small percentage of what Starboard would need to take control of the board.Yahoo declined to comment for this article.In February, Yahoo said it would auction off its core business while attempting to split its stakes in Chinese e-commerce leader Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) and Yahoo Japan from the rest of the business. Yahoo holds a 15.27 percent stake in Alibaba and a 35.49 percent stake in Yahoo Japan.  Some investors said they have become disenchanted with Mayer. Others said they were never fans of her but bought the stock expecting strategic moves that would boost its value. None voiced support for Mayer.    ""There's going to be overwhelming support for the Starboard slate if there is not material value creation ahead of the annual meeting"" through an asset sale, said Jeff Lignelli, chief executive of Incline Global Management in New York, which owns about a million of Yahoo's roughly 950 million shares outstanding.Lignelli said he began buying Yahoo shares two years ago.

Yahoo's web business is estimated to be worth several billion of dollars more than Time Inc's market capitalization of just $1.6 billion.Time Inc held conversations with buyout firms before signing a non-disclosure agreement with Yahoo recently that forbids bidders in the sale process from communicating with each other, the people said this week. However, Time Inc is hoping that Yahoo will allow bidders to form consortia after they submit first-round bids that are due on April 11, the people added. Time Inc has not yet selected any private equity firm as a potential partner, the people said.Several private equity firms are weighing bids for Yahoo's internet assets including Blackstone Group LP (BX.N), KKR & Co LP (KKR.N), TPG Capital LP, Apax Partners LLP, Warburg Pincus LLC, Bain Capital LLC and Hellman & Friedman LLC, the people said. A potential deal structure that Time Inc and its investment bankers have been considering is a Reverse Morris Trust, the people said. This could potentially allow Yahoo to divest assets in a tax-efficient manner, the people added.Spokespeople for Yahoo, Time Inc and the private equity firms declined to comment. Since Time Inc spun out from parent company Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) in 2014, its chief executive, Joe Ripp, has been vocal about putting more cash into the business and expanding the company beyond its print roots.  The New York-based company, whose titles include People, Sports Illustrated and its namesake Time magazine, has been on a digital shopping spree in recent months. In February, it acquired Viant Technology, a New York-based marketing firm that owns Myspace, an early social media company. Last fall, it bought HelloGiggles, a lifestyle website owned by actress Zooey Deschanel, and xoJane, an online magazine geared to women.  Yahoo faces increasing pressure from shareholders and investors to sell its core business instead of going through a spinoff that would separate the company from its stakes in Yahoo Japan (4689.T) and Alibaba Group (BABA.N). Analysts see Verizon (VZ.N), the large telecommunications company that bought AOL last year for $4.4 billion, as being a more likely candidate to prevail in the auction for Yahoo's web business.Time Inc's revenue annual revenue fell 5 percent to $3.1 billion last year, with print and advertising revenue falling 10 percent to $1.32 billion.

Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google unit is also mulling a bid for Yahoo's core business, Bloomberg reported, citing a source.However, Bloomberg said many companies that had been seen as likely investors in Yahoo were not planning a bid, including AT&T Inc (T.N), Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).Shares of Yahoo fell just over 1 percent to $36.17. Verizon, Yahoo and Google declined to comment for this story. AT&T, Comcast and Microsoft could not be reached immediately for comments.Verizon showed interest in Yahoo's core business as early as December, when Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said the company would ""see if there is a strategic fit"" for its holdings, which include mail, news, sports and advertising technology. Yahoo launched an auction of its core business in February after it shelved plans to spin off its stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N).The offer to purchase Yahoo's 35.5 percent stake in Yahoo Japan could put Verizon one step ahead of any rival bidders.The offer will also likely leave Yahoo Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer out of the mix, since Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam said in a recent television appearance that merging Yahoo's assets with AOL assets under the leadership of AOL CEO Tim Armstrong ""would be a good thing for investors.""  The New York Post reported last month that Mayer has been working to team up with private equity firms to create a ""package deal"" that sells the company and keeps her at the helm.

The group fell 1.9 percent and was the biggest drag on the S&P 500.""There's concern about a global slowdown,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut.

Minutes from the Federal Reserve's March meeting released on Wednesday pointed to concerns about the U.S. central bank's limited ability to tackle a global economic slowdown.Minutes from the European Central Bank's March policy meeting on Thursday showed that governors from around the euro zone had been told the global economic outlook had got worse.Crude oil LCOc1 CLc1 settled lower on Thursday after data showed higher weekly inventories. The S&P energy index .SPNY was down 0.6 percent. Adding to investor caution, first-quarter earnings kick into high gear next week, with a 7.4-percent year-over-year decline projected for S&P 500 companies, according to Thomson Reuters data. Some strategists argue the recent sharp drop in earnings forecasts could result in more positive surprises.Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) shares were down 2.8 percent at $52 after Bloomberg reported Verizon plans to make a first-round bid for Yahoo Inc's (YHOO.O) web business next week.

AT&T, Comcast and Microsoft could not be reached immediately for comments.Verizon showed interest in Yahoo's core business as early as December, when Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said the company would ""see if there is a strategic fit"" for its holdings, which include mail, news, sports and advertising technology. Yahoo launched an auction of its core business in February after it shelved plans to spin off its stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N).The offer to purchase Yahoo's 35.5 percent stake in Yahoo Japan could put Verizon one step ahead of any rival bidders.The offer will also likely leave Yahoo Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer out of the mix, since Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam said in a recent television appearance that merging Yahoo's assets with AOL assets under the leadership of AOL CEO Tim Armstrong ""would be a good thing for investors.""  The New York Post reported last month that Mayer has been working to team up with private equity firms to create a ""package deal"" that sells the company and keeps her at the helm.  Verizon shares were down 2.84 percent.

526,"  (Adds DMGT statement, analyst comment)LONDON, April 11 Britain's Daily Mail is in talks with potential partners to mount a joint bid for Yahoo's  internet assets, eyeing a plan to buy the troubled U.S. Internet pioneer to help boost advertising revenues from the Mail's globally popular online news site.The parent company of the British newspaper, the Daily Mail & General Trust, said on Monday that it was in early stage discussions with several parties about a possible bid for Yahoo, confirming a Wall Street Journal report it had approached private equity buyers to team up.""We have been in discussions with a number of parties who are potential bidders,"" a spokeswoman for DailyMail.com said in an emailed statement, declining to name the private equity firms or give any financial details.DailyMail.com and MailOnline are the celebrity-focused news websites of the right-leaning London-based Daily Mail newspaper. Globally the websites attract 14 million visitors a day, putting them among the world's most popular English language news sites. Buying Yahoo's assets - which range from search and email to news, sports, photos and other properties - would expand DailyMail.com's reach and improve its digital ad revenues, which for its 2015 financial year came in at 73 million pounds ($104 million), a tenth of the company's overall annual turnover.Liberum analyst Ian Whittaker said a deal with Yahoo would be positive for the company, helping it sell more U.S. advertising and reducing its dependence on shrinking advertising sales from its newspaper business in Britain.""The U.S. has been the main driver of digital growth for Daily Mail & General Trust, whilst traffic has grown well they haven't quite monetised this traffic as successfully as they would have liked,"" Whittaker said. That would follow a similar but smaller deal last year when it bought Elite Daily, a U.S. news and entertainment website in a deal which it said would make its offering to U.S.-based advertising buyers more attractive by widening its audience.Daily Mail & General Trust PLC's potential bid could take one of two forms, according to the WSJ report, citing people familiar with the matter.

536,"  (Repeats Friday's story without changes to text)* New internet browser says aims to attract demanding users* Competes with Alphabet, Microsoft and other tech brands* Rejected venture capital, paid $6 mln development costBy Joachim DagenborgOSLO, April 15 Internet browser Vivaldi, which launched last week, must attract five million monthly users to become profitable, its founder and chief executive said in a Reuters interview.The introduction of Vivaldi version 1.0 follows a 15-month development that cost veteran software maker Jon von Tetzchner around 50 million crowns ($6.07 million) of his own money. Offering a wide range of personalised settings and bookmark functions, the Oslo-based browser hopes to lure some of the web's most demanding users away from global brands like Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari and Opera.""A few years ago everyone started simplifying their browsers and they removed many of the features that the so-called power users wanted. This is the segment we are targeting"", von Tetzchner said.""We have many more features and personalisation options than any other browser in the market. Most of these features are new and totally unique for Vivaldi,"" he added. Named after the 18th-century composer Antonio Vivaldi, the name hints at von Tetzchner's previous role as co-founder and long-time head of browser and mobile phone software firm Opera , which he left in 2011.Opera is now the subject of an ongoing $1.28 billion takeover by a group of Chinese firms.""After I left they decided to focus on a totally different user segment, and that opened up a space in the market,"" von Tetzchner said. ""We only need five million monthly users to make money and I'm confident that we will get there."" Vivaldi has been downloaded several million times since the launch of a test version early last year, but von Tetzchner declined to say how many of those had become regular users.Holding 90 percent of the company's shares, and with employees also owning small stakes, von Tetzchner plans to stay firmly in control.""Several of the most well-known venture capital groups, prominent names, have called me up wanting to take part in this company, but I have politely turned them down,"" he said.""One of the things I learned during my Opera years is how important it is to keep control of the company. I'm fortunate to be able to do that this time around.""Vivaldi has also partnered with several content providers including Bing, Yahoo and Yandex and is in talks with Alphabet, von Tetzchner said.($1 = 8.2381 Norwegian crowns)   (Editing by Terje Solsvik)",2016-04-18,YHOO,"Mon Apr 18, 2016 | 1:10am EDT",RPT-Browser startup Vivaldi says needs 5 million users to turn profit,http://www.reuters.com//article/internet-vivaldi-idUSL5N17I38T?type=companyNews

538,"   By Deborah M. Todd and Anya George Tharakan  Yahoo Inc's first-quarter results beat Wall Street estimates by a hair but revenue dropped 11.3 percent, as the web-pioneer struggled to boost growth in the core online search and display advertising business that is in the processing of auctioning off.Revenue fell to $1.09 billion in the first quarter ended March 31, the first decline after four straight quarters of growth. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $1.08 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.On an adjusted basis, it earned 8 cents per share. Analysts were expecting earnings of 7 cents.""Given all the challenges Yahoo has faced with the reduction of its workforce and the Alibaba spinoff plan, to come in and deliver these numbers is a very positive thing,"" JMP Securities analyst Ronald Josey said.The company's shares rose nearly 1 percent to $36.66 in light volumes in extended trading on Tuesday.Under pressure from activist investors, Yahoo launched the auction of its core business in February after shelving plans to spin off its stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. It has also said it could spin off the business. The first round of bids for interested parties closed on Monday, according to media reports. Verizon Communications Inc is reportedly the favourite to win the auction and YP Holdings LLC, formerly known as Yellowpages.com, is the latest firm to express interest.Time Inc, Alphabet Inc, Comcast Corp, AT&T Inc [TATTC.UL] and IAC/Interactivecorp stepped out of contention prior to Monday’s deadline to submit bids, according to a Dow Jones report.But if activist investor Starboard Value LP has its way, Yahoo's Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer and her entire management team will be pushed out in favour of a board of its choosing to conduct the sale process. Starboard, which owns 1.7 percent of Yahoo, announced last month it will push for a proxy fight during Yahoo’s annual meeting, expected to take place in June. Yahoo gave few details in its earnings statement Tuesday but said it considers the strategic alternatives process ""... a top priority.""Yahoo said it sees second-quarter GAAP revenue of $1.05 billion to $1.09 billion - below analysts' view of $1.10 billion.        Murali Sankar, Boenning & Scattergood Inc analyst said the company is meeting its guidance mostly because it has lowered its own expectations for the future - a trend he expects to continue.  ""It looks like they're doing the same thing for the second quarter, setting themselves up for hopefully another beat. You could argue that they're maybe being a little conservative,"" he said.In her nearly four years as Yahoo's CEO, Mayer has made little progress in her attempts to win back market share from bigger internet players such Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google.Mayer’s attempts to gain market share included the $1.1 billion acquisition of social blogging site Tumblr and the MAVENS strategy - a shift towards promoting mobile, video, native and social networking advertising products.The internet company's revenue peaked in 2008 and while it still runs some of the world's most-read websites, it has been unable to keep up with Google and Facebook in the battle for online advertisers.

549,"   By Esha Vaish and Rishika S  The parent of Britain's Daily Mail said on Wednesday it had not submitted its own bid to buy Yahoo Inc's core Internet business, but was still in talks to partner with other suitors of the U.S. company.Yahoo, which has been struggling with falling ad revenue for years, has sped up the process to sell its media, email and other web businesses, bowing to pressure from activist shareholder Starboard Value LP and others.Shares of Yahoo rose as much as 5 percent on Wednesday, as investors digested the company's slightly better-than-expected quarterly results late on Tuesday and CEO Marissa Mayer's reassurances that she was focused on the sale.Yahoo's advisers are working through offers to put together a short list, and Verizon Communications Inc was set to advance to the second stage of bidding for the internet company's core assets, Reuters reported, citing sources.Daily Mail & General Trust Plc said last week it was in talks with potential partners to mount a joint bid for Yahoo's internet assets. Buying Yahoo's core assets - which include a search engine and email, news and sports services - would boost Daily Mail's  online reach and digital ad revenue from its globally popular websites, and partly offset shrinking print revenue.Private-equity firms Apax Partners LLP, TPG Capital LP, Bain Capital LLC, Apollo Global Management LLC and Warburg Pincus LLC have also submitted first-round bids, according to sources.As well, the auction has attracted interest from Japanese online retailer Rakuten Inc and Yellow Pages owner YP LLC, which is backed by AT&T Corp. While investors seemed pacified by Yahoo's results and the progress on the sale, analysts said the company management's failure to address key questions about the bidding process had added a level of uncertainty.""We were hoping that (Mayer) would provide more color on what was for sale ... and timing around the process,"" Neil Doshi, an analyst at Mizuho Securities USA said in a note. ""Too little, too late"" was how Barclays analyst Paul Vogel characterized Yahoo's renewed focus on mobile and video search initiatives.However, Barclays, Mizuho and at least 9 other brokerages raised their price targets on Yahoo's stock, mostly based on the change in the value of Yahoo's Asian assets.Oppenheimer was the most bullish, raising its target to $49 from $40.

550,"   By Malathi Nayak and Sai Sachin R  Verizon Communications Inc said an ongoing strike by its wireline workers was expected to hurt earnings in the current quarter, even as it reported first-quarter net income that met analyst expectations amid strong tablet sales.Shares of Verizon, the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier, fell 3.4 percent to $49.99 at midday on Thursday.If the strike, now in its second week, continues for an extended period of time, it could pressure full-year earnings, Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said in an interview. ""We'd like to settle this sooner than later,"" Shammo said.About 40,000 employees of Verizon's wireline business, which includes its Fios Internet, telephone and TV services, went on strike after reaching an impasse in talks over a new labor contract. Issues include healthcare, offshoring of call center jobs, temporary job relocations and pensions.In the wireline business, consumer revenue of $4 billion was little changed from a year ago.  Net income attributable to the company rose to $4.31 billion, or $1.06 per share, in the first quarter, meeting analysts' expectations.   The company stood by its full-year profit forecast. Verizon has been scaling back its Fios TV and Internet business, which represented about 29 percent of its 2015 revenue.  ""Rather than investing in good jobs here at home, Verizon refuses to make Fios available to thousands of people ... throughout the East Coast and is embarking on a questionable path to acquire troubled Yahoo and other companies,"" Brooklyn-based Verizon field technician Anthony Finocchio, said in a statement on Thursday.   To tap new revenue, the company has shifted its focus to the advertising-supported Internet business and acquired AOL last June for $4.4 billion. It is seen as the front-runner in bidding for Yahoo Inc's core Internet business.The company, known for its high-quality network, is locked in a battle for subscribers with competitors in the saturated U.S. wireless market. Smaller rival Sprint Corp has been offering half-off discounts, and T-Mobile US Inc has launched free music and video-streaming plans. Verizon reported strong subscriber net additions for the first quarter ended March 31, adding 640,000 wireless retail postpaid subscribers, helped by tablet promotions during a seasonally slow period for phone upgrades. That surpassed analysts' average estimate of 480,000, according to market research firm FactSet StreetAccount.Customer defections, or churn, in Verizon's wireless postpaid business, dropped to 0.96 percent from 1.03 percent a year earlier.Total operating revenue rose 0.6 percent to $32.17 billion, falling slightly short of analysts' average estimate of $32.46 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

551,"   By Esha Vaish and Rishika S  The parent of Britain's Daily Mail said on Wednesday it had not submitted its own bid to buy Yahoo Inc's core Internet business, but was still in talks to partner with other suitors of the U.S. company.Yahoo, which has been struggling with falling ad revenue for years, has sped up the process to sell its media, email and other web businesses, bowing to pressure from activist shareholder Starboard Value LP and others.Shares of Yahoo rose as much as 5 percent on Wednesday, as investors digested the company's slightly better-than-expected quarterly results late on Tuesday and CEO Marissa Mayer's reassurances that she was focused on the sale.Yahoo's advisers are working through offers to put together a short list, and Verizon Communications Inc was set to advance to the second stage of bidding for the internet company's core assets, Reuters reported, citing sources.Daily Mail & General Trust Plc said last week it was in talks with potential partners to mount a joint bid for Yahoo's internet assets. Buying Yahoo's core assets - which include a search engine and email, news and sports services - would boost Daily Mail's  online reach and digital ad revenue from its globally popular websites, and partly offset shrinking print revenue.Private-equity firms Apax Partners LLP, TPG Capital LP, Bain Capital LLC, Apollo Global Management LLC and Warburg Pincus LLC have also submitted first-round bids, according to sources.As well, the auction has attracted interest from Japanese online retailer Rakuten Inc and Yellow Pages owner YP LLC, which is backed by AT&T Corp. While investors seemed pacified by Yahoo's results and the progress on the sale, analysts said the company management's failure to address key questions about the bidding process had added a level of uncertainty.""We were hoping that (Mayer) would provide more color on what was for sale ... and timing around the process,"" Neil Doshi, an analyst at Mizuho Securities USA said in a note. ""Too little, too late"" was how Barclays analyst Paul Vogel characterized Yahoo's renewed focus on mobile and video search initiatives.However, Barclays, Mizuho and at least 9 other brokerages raised their price targets on Yahoo's stock, mostly based on the change in the value of Yahoo's Asian assets.Oppenheimer was the most bullish, raising its target to $49 from $40. The median price target on the stock is $40.

553,"   By Michael Flaherty and Liana B. Baker  Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) on Wednesday agreed to add four new independent directors to its board, bowing to pressure from activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP and averting a proxy fight ahead of its upcoming annual meeting.The agreement shows Yahoo's board and management team were under pressure from major shareholders to settle the battle, and that Starboard was willing to set aside its plan for board control in favor of immediate director seats inside the struggling Internet company.A truce with its most vocal activist investor helps Yahoo clear the way for the auction of its core businesses, which is underway.Yahoo said Starboard Chief Executive Jeffrey Smith and three independent directors associated with him will join the board immediately. Yahoo's four new directors were on Starboard's slate that the hedge fund proposed last month to overthrow Yahoo's entire board.The two sides spoke frequently about ways to avoid putting the fate of the board in the hands of shareholders, according to people involved with the negotiations, but it was not until recently that a deal came into focus. Starboard and Yahoo executives were set to meet in March to discuss ways to avoid a proxy fight, but those talks broke down after Yahoo appointed two new board members, said the people, who did not want to be named.Key to the agreement is that Smith is also joining Yahoo's strategic review committee, which is overseeing the company's sale of its core business - a process Smith has aggressively pushed. For Starboard's Smith, the concession is being part of that key committee even though the deal does not give him board control, said Eric Jackson, managing director at SpringOwl Asset Management, a fund that owns Yahoo shares.""The decision point for Smith was, 'Do we want to be inside the tent when a deal goes down or do we want to be sitting on the outside hoping the board does the right thing?'"" Jackson said.Separately, Starboard struck an agreement with Marvell Technology Group (MRVL.O) on Wednesday. Yahoo said in a statement that two incumbent directors, Lee Scott and Sue James, would step down at the annual meeting. With the addition of the four new directors, Yahoo's board will have 11 members. Yahoo has not set a formal date for its annual meeting, but historically it is held in late June. Yahoo's agreement with Starboard means the company can now put the prospect of a costly and distracting proxy fight behind it, and focus on the sale of its core search business, which is fielding bids from potential buyers such as Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N).The company also faces the complication of sorting out its connection to Softbank Group Corp (9984.T), which owns 43 percent of Yahoo Japan Corp, and China's Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N), in which Yahoo holds a 15.5 percent stake. CORE SALE Starboard, which owns about 1.7 percent of Yahoo, has been pushing for changes at the company since 2014. The activist hedge fund took aim at Yahoo's leadership in a January letter, implying that Mayer and top officials needed to go. Yahoo was started by Jerry Yang and David Filo in a Stanford University dorm room, and the search company quickly became a tech-boom darling in the late 1990s. But starting from just before the 2008 financial crisis, the company has constantly been under threat from activist shareholders unhappy with its performance, including hedge fund heavyweights Carl Icahn and Daniel Loeb of Third Point. Starboard ramped up its pressure late last year, culminating in a filing in March when it proposed to replace all of Yahoo's board, a rare move in activist investing.Yahoo's new directors aside from Smith will be tech and media industry veterans Tor Braham, Eddy Hartenstein and Richard Hill, who were part of Starboard's proposed slate.Yahoo's stock dipped 1 percent to $36.73 per share on Wednesday.

The sources declined to divulge the full list.Some bidders that did not make the shortlist because their first-round offers were not specific enough are still being kept close to the process by Yahoo's advisers, the people said. One of those bidders is Liberty Media Corp Chairman John Malone, who has proposed a tax-efficient merger with one of the companies he controls, the people said.The sources asked not to be identified because details of the sale process were confidential. Yahoo, Verizon, TPG and YP declined to comment. Liberty Media did not respond to a request for comment.  A sale of Yahoo's Internet assets for cash, followed by a divestment of its 35.5 percent stake in Yahoo Japan, would leave the company owning just its 15 percent stake in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.In December, Yahoo scrapped plans to spin off its Alibaba stake, after investors fretted over whether that transaction could have been carried out on a tax-free basis.

""The board members have been terrific and welcoming, the management team has been terrific and welcoming.

With the proxy battle now finished, the company is pressing ahead with the auction of its core business.Smith was asked on the panel what it was like to arrive on the board of a company that has been the target of one of his firm's attacks. ""It’s much more collegial than anyone would expect"" when we go into a company, he said. ""This is business, it’s not personal.""In October 2014, Starboard won a proxy fight against Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants Inc (DRI.N), with shareholders supporting the activist's campaign to overthrow the company's entire board.Smith, who was accompanied on the panel by current Darden CEO Eugene Lee, said arriving on a board with that level of shareholder mandate is extremely powerful. But he added that proxy fights are costly and time-consuming, and that sometimes getting inside the board room quickly is the best option.""It's a tough call,"" Smith said.Smith was also asked about Starboard's investment in department store operator Macy's Inc (M.N), whose shares have fallen by roughly half since Starboard invested in the company last year. Smith said the company has reduced costs and has laid out a plan to monetize its real estate, but he admitted that Starboard invested too early.""Sometimes you don't get the timing right,"" he said.

Ted Henderson, a former House employee, said two Google-hosted apps he created specifically for use by congressional staffers to discuss politics and share alerts on votes are now effectively banned on their work network. The disabling of appspot.com occurred after the House Information Security Office sent an advisory email to lawmakers and staffers on April 30 warning of increased phishing attacks on the House network from third party, web-based mail applications including Yahoo Mail and Gmail.“The attacks are focused on putting ‘ransomware’ on users’ computers,” the email, seen by Reuters, states. It added that the primary focus of the attackers appeared to be Yahoo Mail, which was being blocked on the network “until further notice.” Two individuals fell victim to ransomware by clicking on infected Word document email attachments, sources familiar with the hacking said. The infected files were able to be recovered without paying any ransom, the sources said.Ransomware attacks, which involve accessing a computer or network’s files and encrypting them until a ransom is paid by the victim, have grown more severe and common in recent years. Yahoo (YHOO.O) is working closely with the House to resolve the matter, a company spokesperson said.

566,"   By Michael Flaherty and Greg Roumeliotis  Berkshire Hathaway Inc Chairman Warren Buffett is backing a consortium vying for Yahoo Inc's internet assets that includes Quicken Loans Inc founder Dan Gilbert, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.While there is no certainty that the consortium will prevail in the auction, the interest of Buffett and Gilbert is a boost for the Sunnyvale, California-based company, which has been surpassed in recent years by rivals such as Alphabet Inc in the race for internet users and advertising dollars.The consortium's participation in the sale process also represents a challenge to U.S. telecommunications carrier Verizon Communications Inc, whose deal to acquire AOL last year for $4.4 billion has made it a favorite to prevail in its bid for Yahoo's assets among industry analysts.The consortium is in the second round of bidding in the auction for Yahoo's assets, the people said. Buffett is helping finance the offer, one of the people added.It is not clear whether Gilbert, a billionaire who also owns the U.S. basketball team Cleveland Cavaliers, is using Quicken Loans in any way as part of the consortium's bid. The sources asked not to be identified because the details of the sale process are confidential. Buffett offered no immediate comment when reached by telephone. Quicken Loans declined to comment on behalf of Gilbert, while Yahoo declined to comment.Reuters reported last month that Yahoo had shortlisted close to 10 bidders in the auction for its assets, with most offers coming from private equity firms.At Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting last month, Buffett admitted that Berkshire had been slow to adapt to new technology as far as its investments were concerned.  Buffett, whose Berkshire is an IBM Corp shareholder, said in a CNBC interview on May 2 that Yahoo's business had deteriorated significantly and that ""something has to change there."" He did not mention any potential bid on his part.Susan Decker, who worked at Yahoo in several senior roles between 2000 and 2009, including president and chief financial officer, is now a director on Berkshire's board. ""I hope the next owner can do something to revitalize the spirit of the core things that made Yahoo very, very unique and create a distinction in consumers' minds about why they love Yahoo still. It will be helpful if it is private or part of a much larger corporation to achieve that,"" she said on CNBC in an interview on April 29. Last month, Yahoo said that activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP Chief Executive Jeffrey Smith and three independent directors associated with him would join its board immediately.Yahoo's four new directors were on a slate that Starboard had proposed to oust Yahoo's entire board.

569,"   By Deborah M. Todd | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Warren Buffett struck media gold with a 2012 investment in debt-laden Media General Inc (MEG.N). Now the famed investor may try to reprise that success by supporting a bid for Yahoo Inc's (YHOO.O) Internet assets.The Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) chairman is backing a consortium that includes Quicken Loans Inc founder Dan Gilbert, that is seeking to buy Yahoo's online portfolio, Reuters reported on Friday.    The consortium is in the second round of bidding in the auction for Yahoo's assets, people familiar with the matter said. Buffett is helping to finance the offer, one of the people added. If they succeed, the investment would be a relatively rare foray into digital media for Buffett, whose portfolio is heavily weighted toward U.S. insurers, industrial companies and major consumer brands.Yahoo, once the world's largest consumer email service, has struggled in recent years to compete with Alphabet Inc’s Google (GOOGL.O) and Facebook Inc (FB.O) for digital advertising market share.     In February, CEO Marissa Mayer announced the company would auction off its Internet business and cut 15 percent of its workforce. It is also selling $1 billion to $3 billion in noncore assets such as patents and property.    Poynter Institute media business analyst Rick Edmonds said Buffett's history of betting on struggling companies that maintain a large consumer base could work in Yahoo's favor.      In the case of Media General, Buffett bought a majority of the company’s newspapers, making him one of the largest publishers in the United States as the industry struggled with plummeting advertising and subscription revenue. Buffett also provided nearly $450 million in debt relief to Media General, whose remaining business focused on dozens of local U.S. television stations and related websites, in return for a stake of nearly 20 percent in the company. The day the transaction was announced, Media General's shares jumped 30 percent. The stock closed Friday at $17.12, up from $3.32 in May 2012.  ""It's kind of consistent with Buffett's pattern of buying things that are out of favor, undervalued and have a big customer base,"" Edmonds said. The paradox is Yahoo's huge, it remains huge, and it's got a lot of customers. It's not the case customers are fleeing them right and left, it's just that no one can get a good pattern of growth.""Pivotal Research Analyst Brian Wieser agreed the move would be a familiar one for Buffett.     ""Yahoo is known for having a lot of assets that have a lot of potential that for a host of reasons have not realized that potential,"" he said.     Former Yahoo president and chief financial officer Susan Decker said last month on CNBC that the next owner should ""create a distinction in consumers' minds about why they love Yahoo still."" She said that plan would be helped if Yahoo is ""private or part of a much larger corporation.""     During a CNBC interview earlier this month Buffett said that Yahoo's business has ""continuously slipped"" but did not mention a bid or a specific turnaround strategy.Buffett and Dan Gilbert have been close friends since 2012, when Gilbert joined the Giving Pledge, an initiative created by Buffett and Bill Gates to encourage billionaires to give away at least half of their wealth during their lifetime or at death. Berkshire Hathaway provided insurance on a $1 billion prize offered by Quicken Loans to anyone who completed a perfect bracket in the 2014 National Collegiate Athletic Association men’s basketball tournament. No one pulled off the feat. ""There could well be more business relationships in the future, but beyond that it’s a friendship,"" Buffett said, referring to Gilbert, in a telephone interview with Reuters on April 5.Part of the consortium's interest may lie in Yahoo Finance.  Gilbert has shown strong interest in that unit, according to a source who asked not to be identified.Buffett has credited Yahoo with doing a ""terrific"" job during live streaming of Berkshire's April 30 shareholders conference. At that meeting he also admitted that Berkshire had been slow to adapt to new technology as far as its investments were concerned. (This story corrects paragraph 12 to show analyst was referring to Yahoo's assets, not Buffett's assets.

581,"   By Greg Roumeliotis and Liana B. Baker | NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO  NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO Verizon Communications Inc is working on its bid for Yahoo Inc's core assets with an investment bank which was, as recently as last year, one of the U.S. internet company's top advisers, people familiar with the matter said.Verizon has added former Yahoo adviser Bank of America Corp to its roster of investment banks, as the U.S. telecommunications carrier seeks an edge over other bidders ahead of a June 6 second-round bid deadline in the auction for the core assets, the people said this week.The sources asked not to be identified because details of the auction process are confidential. Verizon, Yahoo and Bank of America declined to comment.Bank of America has intimate knowledge of Yahoo. The bank was listed as its lead adviser last year on a plan to spin off its 15 percent stake in China's e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, whose value is equivalent to 84 percent of Yahoo's $35 billion market capitalization.That plan was abandoned in December on concerns that the spin-off could result in a tax bill that would have potentially exceeded $10 billion. Bank of America can also help provide financing for Verizon's offer. The three other investment banks working on the bid - Guggenheim Partners LLC, LionTree LLC and Allen & Company - are boutiques with limited or no balance sheet for deal financing.While Verizon is prepared to buy all the core assets, the New York-based company is primarily interested in Yahoo's advertising technology tools, according to one of the sources. It is also examining how the other assets up for sale, such as search, mail and messenger, could be combined with the corresponding businesses of AOL, which it acquired last year for $4.4 billion, the source said. Given its synergies with AOL, analysts see Verizon as the most likely candidate to prevail in the auction for Yahoo's web business, which has garnered interest from a host of private equity firms and other bidders such as a Warren Buffett-backed consortium led by Quicken Loans Inc founder Dan Gilbert.While valuation estimates for Yahoo's core assets vary, sources have suggested that first-round bids for the assets ranged from $4 billion to $8 billion. Beyond AOL, Verizon has taken other steps to advance its advertising-backed internet business, including taking over Microsoft Corp's advertising technology unit and buying a company called Millennial Media.

601,"   By Greg Roumeliotis | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. telecommunications rivals Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc are set to go through to the third and final round of bidding in the auction for Yahoo Inc's core internet assets, according to people familiar with the matter.After holding a board meeting to review second-round offers, Yahoo will start reaching out to bidders as early as Monday to notify them whether they will make it to the next round, one of the people said.Verizon, the biggest U.S. wireless carrier, is seeking to challenge AT&T, the second largest U.S. wireless provider, in the third round of bidding, even though its latest offer was at the low end of the $3.5 billion to $5 billion range of the second-round bids that came in last week, the people said.Yahoo hopes to conclude the auction by next month, according to one of the people. The Sunnyvale, California-based company started exploring a sale of the assets after coming under pressure from activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP.A consortium led by Quicken Loans Inc founder Dan Gilbert, and backed by Berkshire Hathaway Inc Chairman Warren Buffett, will also make it through to the final round, the people added. Some private equity firms that had made it through to the second round will not be invited to submit third-round bids, another of the people said.The people familiar with the matter asked not to be identified because the bids were confidential.Yahoo, Verizon and AT&T declined to comment. A Quicken Loans spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on behalf of Gilbert's consortium. Not all offers involve exactly the same assets, with some bidders indicating they are not interested in some of the patents and real estate assets on offer, sources have previously said.Verizon is primarily interested in Yahoo's advertising technology tools. It has been examining how the other assets up for sale, such as search, mail and messenger services, could be combined with the corresponding businesses of AOL, which it acquired last year for $4.4 billion, Reuters reported last month. AT&T has been seeking to catch up with Verizon in advertising technology as it seeks to expand in mobile video offerings.A sale of Yahoo's internet assets would leave the company just owning a 35.5 percent stake in Yahoo Japan Corp, as well as a 15 percent stake in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, which accounts for most of its value.In December, Yahoo scrapped plans to spin off its Alibaba stake, after investors fretted over whether that transaction could have been carried out on a tax-free basis.

602,"   By Dan Freed | DETROIT  DETROIT The connection between Quicken Loans Inc founder Dan Gilbert and billionaire magnate Warren Buffett became evident last month with news that Buffett was backing Gilbert's surprise bid for Yahoo Inc.But the two men have another business connection that hasn't been reported: an exclusive mortgage-purchasing agreement between Quicken and a subsidiary of Buffett's conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc.Berkshire owns a company called Vanderbilt Mortgage and Finance Inc, which buys mortgages for traditional houses exclusively from Quicken, Buffett said in an interview. Vanderbilt's primary business is funding mortgages for Clayton Homes, the largest U.S. maker of mobile and manufactured homes, which is also owned by Berkshire.""We buy a very few loans unrelated to the manufactured home business, and Quicken is the one we buy them from,"" Buffett told Reuters.Quicken has been selling loans to Vanderbilt for nearly a year in a test program, spokesman Jordan Fylonenko said in an email. The partnership has led to about $20 million in closed loans so far, and Quicken is issuing new loans at a rate that would generate $50 million per year, he said. Fylonenko declined to discuss the rationale for its program with Vanderbilt.     The purchases account for a small portion of either company's business. Quicken, for instance, generated $78.5 billion of mortgages altogether last year. Still, the arrangement shows that Buffett and Gilbert are looking for creative ways to work together.     Prior to this deal and the Yahoo bid, their only known business relationship was one in which Berkshire provided Quicken insurance for a NCAA basketball contest the lender sponsored in 2014.    Quicken had said it would award $1 billion to anyone who could perfectly guess winning teams throughout the season. The odds of success were miniscule – and no one won – but Quicken received a slew of email addresses and phone numbers for potential customers who entered the contest. It paid Berkshire a premium for providing the insurance.Buffett and Gilbert met at a conference some years ago and became friends after having lunch together in Omaha, where Buffett lives. While speaking to Reuters about Quicken, Buffett expressed admiration for Gilbert's management style and boundless energy.     Meanwhile, in Gilbert's office there are three giant cutouts of Buffett's head stuck to a whiteboard, one of them autographed. The cutouts were made by a printing company Gilbert owns, called Fathead LLC.    ""There could well be more business relationships in the future, but beyond that it's a friendship,"" Buffett told Reuters.

604,"   By Malathi Nayak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), the No. 1 U.S. wireless provider, said on Wednesday that it would increase plan rates but expand data buckets by 30 percent for its customers, who increasingly stream content through mobile devices.Starting July 7, the company will roll out a revamped version of its My Verizon mobile app to let customers control data overages and billing, as well as manage plans, it said. Moreover, emulating moves by some of its rivals such as AT&T Inc (T.N) and T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O), it will let customers carry unused data over to the next month and begin offering users on certain plans unlimited text and calling to and from Mexico and Canada.The redesigned plans and app come as the company, known for its high-quality network, is locked in a battle for subscribers with competitors in the saturated U.S. wireless market. Smaller rival Sprint Corp (S.N) has been offering half-off discounts, and T-Mobile has launched free music, video-streaming plans and other customer-friendly offers and free gifts to attract customers away from competitors to their networks. The new rate plans are meant to help customers tackle data overage costs and ""reflect the significant growth in individual data use,"" Rob Miller, vice president of consumer pricing at Verizon said in a webcast on Wednesday.Verizon is hiking rates and increasing data across all its plans. For instance, the basic ""S"" plan will cost $35, a $5 rise, and offer double the data at 2 gigabytes and the high-end ""XXL"" plan will cost $10 more at $110 and offer 24 gigabytes as opposed to the previous 16 gigabyte limit. The company also said it will introduce a ""safety mode"" that protects customers from data overages by slowing down their speeds. The feature is free for those on the ""XL"" and ""XXL"" plans and costs $5 for those on the ""S"", ""M"", ""L"" plans, it said.To tap new revenue beyond its bread-and-butter wireless business, the company has shifted its focus to the advertising-supported Internet business and acquired AOL last June for $4.4 billion. It is seen as the front-runner in bidding for Yahoo Inc's (YHOO.O) core Internet business. Verizon shares were relatively unchanged at $55.93 in afternoon trading.

Todd  Yahoo Inc's (YHOO.O) quarterly earnings fell short of Wall Street expectations on Monday in what may be the company's last financial report before it sells its core business.Yahoo reported adjusted earnings of 9 cents per share, short of the 10 cents that analysts expected. It also announced a $482 million write-down on the value of Tumblr, the social media service that it acquired in 2013 for $1.1 billion.Yahoo is in the process of auctioning off its search and advertising business, and is expected to choose a winner this week. The company said its board has made ""great progress on strategic alternatives"" but did not comment further on the auction process.Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc are said to be in the running to acquire the core business, along with private equity firm TPG Capital and a consortium led by Quicken Loans founder Dan Gilbert and backed by billionaire Warren Buffett.Yahoo also owns large stakes in Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba and Yahoo Japan, which are worth far more than the company's internet business.Monday's earnings report showed the continued slide in Yahoo's business during the protracted sale process. After the Tumblr write-down, the company posted a net loss of $439.9 million, or 46 cents per share, compared with a loss of $21.6 million, or 2 cents per share, a year earlier.  Although total revenue rose to $1.31 billion from $1.24 billion a year earlier, the seeming improvement was the result of a change in the way the cost of acquiring traffic is counted. After deducting fees paid to partner websites for traffic, revenue fell to $841.2 million from $1.04 billion.Estimating that Tumblr is worth ""nothing"" at this point, Ross Gerber, cofounder and CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, said potential buyers were likely bidding lower than Yahoo believes it is worth.""I can't imagine why the sale process is taking so long, the only thing I can think of is it's being overpriced. This report doesn't further create an impression that paying up for these assets has any value,"" Gerber said. Revenue in the company's emerging businesses, which Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer calls Mavens - mobile, video, native and social advertising - showed some life, rising 25.7 percent to $504 million in the second quarter ended June 30. But the improvement in Mavens was offset by decreases in gross search revenue that is only expected to get worse, said B. Riley & Co analyst Sameet Sinha. Gross search revenue for the quarter was $765 million, down 17 percent from the same period last year. ""This is supposed to be the growth engine of the company, and at best it was up slightly year over year. That shows that even in high-growth categories like mobile and native they're losing their search impact,"" he said. JMP Securities analyst Ronald Josey said search revenues are a significant portion of Yahoo's overall revenues and their continued decline could definitely be a factor in the sale negotiations. ""If search continues to decline as much as it has, that's something that's going to be called into question,"" he said.In a conference call, Yahoo Chief Financial Officer Ken Goldman touted the company's cost-cutting efforts.“Through excellent expenditure management of cost and capital, we achieved above the high-end of our guidance on adjusted EBITDA and significantly increased cash flow,” he said, referring to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.Yahoo's shares were little changed at $37.92 in trading after the bell.

These synergies have made Verizon the favorite among industry analysts to prevail in the auction.The sale would also mark the end of Yahoo as an operating company, leaving it only as the owner of a 35.5 percent stake in Yahoo Japan, as well as its 15 percent interest in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N). Those two stakes account for most of Yahoo's $37 billion market capitalization.Yahoo views Verizon as the buyer that can deliver the most value, but negotiations between the two companies are continuing, and no agreement has yet been reached, the sources said. Yahoo would like to have a deal for the core assets by the end of July, one of the sources added.Bloomberg News, which reported earlier that Verizon was nearing an agreement to buy the Yahoo assets, cited an anonymous source as saying the companies were discussing a price close to $5 billion. Yahoo shares were up 0.6 percent at $39.09 in morning trading, while Verizon rose 1.3 percent to $56.09.The sources requested anonymity because the negotiations are confidential.

624,"   By Malathi Nayak and Deborah M. Todd | NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO  NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO Verizon Communications Inc said on Monday it would buy Yahoo Inc's core internet properties for $4.83 billion in cash, marking the end of the line for a storied Web pioneer and setting the stage for a big new internet push by the telecom giant.Verizon (VZ.N) will combine Yahoo's (YHOO.O) search, email and messenger assets as well as advertising technology tools with its AOL unit, which it bought last year for $4.4 billion. Verizon has been looking to mobile video and advertising for new sources of revenue outside the oversaturated wireless market.The No. 1 U.S. wireless operator is betting that it can take data on more than 200 million unique monthly visitors to Yahoo sites, many of them on mobile devices, and combine it with data on 150 million or so unique monthly AOL users and data on its own user base of over 100 million wireless subscribers to offer a more targeted service for advertisers. Barclays said last month Verizon could save $500 million a year in costs of acquiring internet traffic and other expenses by buying Yahoo's internet business.The deal likely means more investment in popular content sites such as AOL’s Huffington Post and Yahoo Finance when they become part of a much larger entity.“It now becomes somewhat easier to justify investing in content,” said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research. Verizon said it would provide more detail on the strategy behind the acquisition when it announces second-quarter earnings on Tuesday.LONG WAY DOWN The deal came after activist investors led by Starboard Value LP lost faith in Yahoo Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer, who was hired in 2012, and forced what became a protracted sale process. Yahoo, founded in 1994, was a dominant player in the early days of the internet, but has long lost its leadership position in internet search and advertising to Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, Facebook Inc (FB.O) and others.Mayer said on a conference call with investors that she planned to stay at Yahoo through the deal's close. Marni Walden, head of product innovation and new business at Verizon, will head the combined internet unit and said no decisions had yet been made on the management team.""Yahoo gives us scale that is what is most critical here,"" said Walden, adding that the company's audience will go from the millions to the billions. ""We want to compete and that is the place we need to be.""Mayer, in an interview with Reuters, said she still saw a ""path to growth"" for Yahoo, especially in mobile. ""What's exciting about the Verizon transaction is that it brings us back to growth sooner,"" she said. She said she was ""open-minded"" about a possible role with the combined companies.But analysts expect AOL CEO Tim Armstrong - like Mayer a one-time Google executive - to be the driving force behind the combined companies. Yahoo is still one of the largest properties on the internet, with hundreds of millions of customers using its email, finance and sports offerings, among others, and a heavily trafficked home page.  But Google has a stranglehold on the internet search business and built an industry-leading email service, while Facebook dominates in mobile and social media. Meanwhile, traditional web banner advertising, long Yahoo's strength, has become much less lucrative in the age of mobile and video.""It's a decade of mismanagement that has finally ended for Yahoo,"" said Recon Analytics analyst Roger Entner. ""It's the continuation of an extension of Verizon's strategy toward becoming a wireless internet player and a move away from (telecom) regulation for Verizon into an unregulated growth industry.Under Armstrong, AOL has beefed up its advertising technology with a string of acquisitions, and launched the mobile video service go90. Verizon has not disclosed how financially successful the unit has been, but Armstrong, known as a formidable salesman, has clearly won the confidence of Verizon's leaders.FAR BEHIND GOOGLE, FACEBOOK  The integration of Yahoo will not come without challenges. In its latest results, it reported a second-quarter net loss of $439.9 million as it wrote down the value of Tumblr, the microblogging and social media service it acquired in 2013 for $1.1 billion. Even with AOL and Yahoo, Verizon would still be far behind s Google and Facebook. According to eMarketer, Yahoo is expected to generate $2.32 billion in net U.S. digital ad sales, while AOL is expected to make $1.3 billion in 2016. Facebook and Google are forecast to deliver sales of $10.3 billion and $24.63 billion, respectively, by the end of this year.The Verizon deal would transform Yahoo into a holding company, with a 15 percent stake in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) and a 35.5 percent interest in Yahoo Japan Corp (4689.T) as well as Yahoo's convertible notes, certain minority investments and its non-core patents. Yahoo executives said the remaining company is structured to ""indefinitely"" hold its Yahoo Japan and Alibaba stakes. They are worth about $40 billion based on their market capitalizations, while Yahoo had a market value of about $37.4 billion at Friday's close.Yahoo will continue as an independent company until the deal receives shareholder and regulatory approvals, the companies said. It is expected to close in early 2017. It plans to change its name and become a publicly traded investment company.Yahoo currently has $7.7 billion in cash, in addition to the $4.8 billion it will receive at the close of the deal, which it plans to return to shareholders, Yahoo executives said on the call.Verizon prevailed over rival bidders, including AT&T Inc (T.N); a group led by Quicken Loans founder Dan Gilbert and backed by billionaire Warren Buffett; private equity firm TPG Capital Management LP [TPG.UL]; and a consortium of buyout firms Vector Capital and Sycamore Partners.Under pressure from Starboard, Yahoo launched an auction of its core business in February after shelving plans to spin off its stake in Alibaba.

632,"   By Jonathan Weber and Jeffrey Dastin | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO When senior Yahoo executives gathered at a San Jose hotel for a management retreat in the spring of 2006, there was no outward sign of a company in crisis. The internet pioneer, not yet a teenager, had just finished the prior year with $1.9 billion in profits on $5.3 billion in revenue. The tough days of the dot-com bust were a distant memory, and Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O), flush with lucrative advertising deals from the world's biggest brands, was enjoying its run as one of the top dogs in the world's hottest industry.But for one retreat exercise, everyone was asked to say what word came to mind when a company name was mentioned. They went through the list: eBay: auctions. Google: search. Intel: microprocessors. Microsoft: Windows. Then they were asked to write down their answer for Yahoo.""It was all over the map,"" recalled Brad Garlinghouse, then a Yahoo senior vice president and now COO of payment settlement start-up Ripple Labs. ""Some people said mail. Some people said news. Some people said search."" While some executives said this was a useful management exercise that took place multiple times over the years, it proved an ominous portent of the business troubles to come.Indeed, the demise of Yahoo, which culminated in an agreement this week to sell the company's core assets to Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), has been more than a decade in the making. Many of the more than two dozen former Yahoo managers interviewed by Reuters over the past two weeks -- who now occupy executives suites elsewhere in Silicon Valley -- agree that the company's downfall can be traced to choices made by both the executive leadership and the board of directors during the company's heyday in the mid-2000s.Some of the missed opportunities are obvious: a failed bid to buy Facebook Inc (FB.O) for $1 billion in 2006. A 2002 dalliance with Google (GOOGL.O) similarly came to naught. A chance to acquire YouTube came and went. Skype was snapped up by eBay Inc (EBAY.O). And Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) nearly $45 billion takeover bid for all of Yahoo in 2008 was blocked by Yahoo's leadership.Just as damaging as the missed deals, though, was a company culture that ultimately became too bureaucratic and too focused on traditional brand advertising to prosper in a fast-moving tech business, according to some of the former Yahoo managers Reuters spoke with.""It became very difficult to get both investment and alignment"" around new product initiatives, said Greg Cohn, a former senior product director at Yahoo and now CEO of the mobile phone app company Burner. ""If you built a new product and the home page didn't want to feature it, you were hosed.""Worst of all, once Alphabet Inc's Google had displaced it as peoples' first stop for finding something on the internet, Yahoo was never able to decide on exactly what it wanted to be.Yahoo today has more than 1 billion users and has focused on mobile under chief executive Marissa Mayer, who told Reuters in an interview Monday that she still saw a ""path to growth"" for Yahoo, which the Verizon merger accelerated.Yahoo will continue to operate as a holding company for its large stakes in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan, which are worth far more than the core business.Yahoo declined to comment for this story. THE PURPLE CARPET The appointment of Terry Semel, who had completed a highly successful run as chairman of the Warner Bros. movie studio, as CEO in 2001 seemed to answer a question that bedeviled many early internet firms: was it a tech company, or a media company?Semel could not be reached for comment on his Yahoo tenure. But the focus on media proved lucrative in the short term as big advertisers, desperate to get on board with the next big thing, flocked to one of the largest properties on the web. Revenue soared from $717 million in 2001 to nearly $7 billion by 2007.Indeed, Semel and the media executives he brought in by all accounts turned a scrappy young internet startup into a highly profitable company that brought old-line advertising to a new medium. ""From our perspective, we were a media company,"" said Dan Rosensweig, Yahoo's COO from 2002 to 2007 and now CEO of online education company Chegg Inc (CHGG.N). ""It didn’t feel at the time that there was a strong likelihood we would beat Google at search... Nobody could argue that we weren’t the largest front page on the internet.""Yahoo placed its signature purple everywhere then -- on cookies and cupcakes, on the carpets, and even in the martinis.""When Coca Cola came to campus, we rolled out the purple carpet,"" recalled Wenda Harris Millard, Yahoo's chief sales officer from 2001 to 2007 and now president and COO of business development firm MediaLink. Millard said all the major advertisers, from Coke to General Motors, wanted to come to Yahoo's campus at least once a year.""We were just doing gazillions of dollars with them,"" said Millard.THE MONEY TRAP But the excitement, and the revenue, associated with the big advertising deals ten years ago turned out to be a trap in many ways. Like its brethren in the print media business, who continued to rely on selling ad pages long after it was clear that it was a dying business, Yahoo couldn't help but to focus on where the big money was, even though that wasn't where the future was. ""The worst consequence of trying to be a media company was that they didn't take programming seriously enough,"" wrote Paul Graham, co-founder of the Y-Combinator tech incubator who sold a startup to Yahoo, in a 2010 blog post about the company's woes. ""Microsoft (back in the day), Google, and Facebook have all had hacker-centric cultures. But Yahoo treated programming as a commodity.""The downside of the media orientation became more clear as the 2000s wore on. In 2003, Yahoo acquired Overture, the company that essentially invented the ad-search technology that made Google rich. But Yahoo never succeeded in creating a strong competitor to Google's AdWords and AdSense systems.A subsequent, hugely expensive effort to rebuild its search and advertising technology, dubbed Panama, similarly bore little fruit.  Meanwhile, market-leading products like Yahoo Mail, and early social media efforts like Yahoo Groups, were neglected as managers wrestled over which products would get priority on the hugely valuable Yahoo home page, according to three former executives. Promising acquisitions, including photo-sharing site Flickr and social bookmarking service Delicious, withered on the vine. Former staffers say they were consumed with endless internal meetings and shifting priorities. Former senior product director Cohn recalls how efforts to make Yahoo an open platform -- with nifty third-party applications around specific content areas such as travel -- foundered in the face of opposition from managers in charge of Yahoo's in-house products.Too often, the end result was money spread too thinly across too many marginal initiatives, as Garlinghouse famously pointed out in a leaked internal document known as the Peanut Butter Manifesto. TURMOIL AT THE TOP By 2007, it was becoming clear that Yahoo was losing ground fast on the product side as Google solidified its hold on search. New players like Facebook and Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) continued to arrive and steal Yahoo's thunder. Semel left that year in favor of co-founder Jerry Yang.Whatever plans Yang may have had were quickly disrupted by the unsolicited Microsoft takeover bid in early 2008. The offer split the management team, Garlinghouse and others say, and those divisions persisted even after Microsoft's offer was beaten back.Yang, who championed the resistance to Microsoft, stepped down again in 2008. Three other CEOs followed before Mayer was appointed in 2014.The leadership turmoil ""made for a difficult existence for a board, a management team, and a general employee population to get committed to the same goal,"" said Rosensweig. Yang did not respond to requests for comment.By the time Mayer arrived, Yahoo was already seen in Silicon Valley as a company from another era. It had lots of cash but few strategic advantages as it fought far larger competitors.  Many analysts and shareholder say Mayer exacerbated the troubles with acquisitions and key hires that proved misguided.Mayer put a brave face on the deal Monday, saying the scale that will result from the Verizon combination will enable it to continue its efforts to catch up in mobile, social and advertising technology. But the history of the tech business, where companies rarely dominate from one generation to the next, suggests that any such revival is a tall order.

BakerJuly 26 Yahoo Inc shareholders may be left betting on how quickly, if at all, the former web pioneer can cash in on its multi-billion dollar stakes in two Asian peers after Monday's deal to sell its core internet assets to Verizon Communications Inc.Most of Yahoo's $36.4 billion market value is derived from its 15 percent stake in Chinese online commerce company Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd and its 35.5 percent stake in joint venture Yahoo Japan Corp. These are not included in Yahoo's deal with Verizon.Investors will be hoping for a quick sale of these stakes, but Yahoo has been looking for years without success for a way to make money from the investments without incurring a huge tax bill. Yahoo declined to comment on potential scenarios on Monday.Prior to running an auction for its core business, which included its advertising tools and internet assets such as search and email, Yahoo explored spinning off its stake in Alibaba to Yahoo shareholders, but abandoned the plan because the U.S. Internal Revenue Service would not provide assurances it could be carried out on a tax-free basis.The scenario many investors are now rooting for is Yahoo Japan and Alibaba buying back these stakes from Yahoo in some way that saves on taxes. Even though they would likely buy back these shares at a discount, Yahoo investors would benefit, according to Eric Jackson, managing director at SpringOwl Asset Management LLC, which owns Yahoo shares.""Hopefully by the end of this year, we have some sort of transaction, preferably with Alibaba buying its stake back and  Yahoo Japan buying its stake back,"" Jackson said.Such a deal would likely involve some tax, due to the fact that the stakes have appreciated greatly in value, but it is unclear how much.Bankers and analysts argue it is most likely that Yahoo will find a way to divest its Yahoo Japan stake, worth more than $8 billion on paper, before making any decision on the Alibaba stake, which is worth more than $30 billion. CAP ON TAX Yahoo's shares in Yahoo Japan date back to 1996, when the internet company launched a joint venture with Japan's SoftBank Group Corp.To minimize its tax liabilities, Yahoo could do a ""cash-rich split off"" with Yahoo Japan, whereby Yahoo would swap its Yahoo Japan shares for cash and assets from Yahoo Japan, according to corporate tax law consultant Robert Willens.Yahoo Japan would have to create a subsidiary, contribute cash and an operating business that has been active for five years, according to Willens. Cash can only make up two-thirds of the new company's value, with at least one-third of the value coming from the operating business, according to Willens. Then Yahoo Japan could give this subsidiary to Yahoo in exchange for Yahoo's shares in Yahoo Japan, Willens said.Yahoo itself hinted on Monday it prefers to deal with Yahoo Japan first, rather than Alibaba. Yahoo board member Tom McInerney, who is chairman of its strategic review committee, said on a conference call with analysts that the company views the stakes in Yahoo Japan and Alibaba differently.For the Alibaba shares, ""our goal is to preserve pre-tax value,"" and the company has ""no current intent sell those in a taxable transaction,"" McInerney said.Yahoo's early investment in Alibaba, made in 2005, has appreciated in value so much that the company would likely have to pay more than $12 billion in tax if it decided to sell its stake, according to Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi.McInerney said the company was more flexible with its shares in Yahoo Japan, whose value is a lot smaller than Alibaba. A cash-rich split would come with challenges, as Yahoo Japan would need to trade some operating asset that it does not want with Yahoo as part of the deal, Willens said. Yahoo, by then a holding company, would end up owning this asset in addition to the Alibaba stake, and would eventually need to figure out what to do with it.SoftBank, Yahoo Japan's biggest shareholder, would also need to bless any deal involving shares in the Japanese company. Yahoo and Yahoo Japan did not offer any comment on Monday. Softbank could not immediately be reached for comment.ALIBABA STAKE Coming up with a solution to the Yahoo Japan stake is key in achieving the ultimate goal of spurring Alibaba into action to buy back its shares from Yahoo, analysts said.Alibaba is the only company that can help Yahoo avoid most of the tax liabilities associated with returning cash from the sale of the stake to Yahoo shareholders. That is because an acquisition by Alibaba of Yahoo owning just the Alibaba stake could be structured as an asset swap, whereby Yahoo shareholders would be paid in Alibaba stock rather than cash.Alibaba, which appears not to be in any rush to do any deal, may decide to play ball with Yahoo to avoid having a proxy or shell company for its shares trading at a discount. Alibaba did not respond to a request for comment.Mogharabi at Morningstar expects the shares in Yahoo, were it to own just the Alibaba stake, to trade at a discount to Alibaba's shares in the open market, because investors would be worried about taxes resulting from a sale.""We believe the shares will trade at a discount as the risk of having to pay some or all of the deferred tax liabilities of those holdings remains,"" Mogharabi said.

635,"   By Liana B. Baker  Yahoo Inc shareholders may be left betting on how quickly, if at all, the former web pioneer can cash in on its multi-billion dollar stakes in two Asian peers after Monday's deal to sell its core internet assets to Verizon Communications Inc.Most of Yahoo's $36.4 billion market value is derived from its 15 percent stake in Chinese online commerce company Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd and its 35.5 percent stake in joint venture Yahoo Japan Corp. These are not included in Yahoo's deal with Verizon.Investors will be hoping for a quick sale of these stakes, but Yahoo has been looking for years without success for a way to make money from the investments without incurring a huge tax bill. Yahoo declined to comment on potential scenarios on Monday. Prior to running an auction for its core business, which included its advertising tools and internet assets such as search and email, Yahoo explored spinning off its stake in Alibaba to Yahoo shareholders, but abandoned the plan because the U.S. Internal Revenue Service would not provide assurances it could be carried out on a tax-free basis. The scenario many investors are now rooting for is Yahoo Japan and Alibaba buying back these stakes from Yahoo in some way that saves on taxes. Even though they would likely buy back these shares at a discount, Yahoo investors would benefit, according to Eric Jackson, managing director at SpringOwl Asset Management LLC, which owns Yahoo shares.""Hopefully by the end of this year, we have some sort of transaction, preferably with Alibaba buying its stake back and  Yahoo Japan buying its stake back,"" Jackson said. Such a deal would likely involve some tax, due to the fact that the stakes have appreciated greatly in value, but it is unclear how much.  Bankers and analysts argue it is most likely that Yahoo will find a way to divest its Yahoo Japan stake, worth more than $8 billion on paper, before making any decision on the Alibaba stake, which is worth more than $30 billion.CAP ON TAX   Yahoo's shares in Yahoo Japan date back to 1996, when the internet company launched a joint venture with Japan's SoftBank Group Corp. To minimize its tax liabilities, Yahoo could do a ""cash-rich split off"" with Yahoo Japan, whereby Yahoo would swap its Yahoo Japan shares for cash and assets from Yahoo Japan, according to corporate tax law consultant Robert Willens. Yahoo Japan would have to create a subsidiary, contribute cash and an operating business that has been active for five years, according to Willens. Cash can only make up two-thirds of the new company's value, with at least one-third of the value coming from the operating business, according to Willens.Then Yahoo Japan could give this subsidiary to Yahoo in exchange for Yahoo's shares in Yahoo Japan, Willens said. Yahoo itself hinted on Monday it prefers to deal with Yahoo Japan first, rather than Alibaba. Yahoo board member Tom McInerney, who is chairman of its strategic review committee, said on a conference call with analysts that the company views the stakes in Yahoo Japan and Alibaba differently. For the Alibaba shares, ""our goal is to preserve pre-tax value,"" and the company has ""no current intent sell those in a taxable transaction,"" McInerney said. Yahoo's early investment in Alibaba, made in 2005, has appreciated in value so much that the company would likely have to pay more than $12 billion in tax if it decided to sell its stake, according to Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi.McInerney said the company was more flexible with its shares in Yahoo Japan, whose value is a lot smaller than Alibaba. A cash-rich split would come with challenges, as Yahoo Japan would need to trade some operating asset that it does not want with Yahoo as part of the deal, Willens said. Yahoo, by then a holding company, would end up owning this asset in addition to the Alibaba stake, and would eventually need to figure out what to do with it. SoftBank, Yahoo Japan's biggest shareholder, would also need to bless any deal involving shares in the Japanese company. Yahoo and Yahoo Japan did not offer any comment on Monday. Softbank could not immediately be reached for comment.

636,"   By Malathi Nayak and Deborah M. Todd | NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO  NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO Verizon Communications Inc said on Monday it would buy Yahoo Inc's core internet properties for $4.83 billion in cash, marking the end of the line for a storied Web pioneer and setting the stage for a big new internet push by the telecom giant.Verizon (VZ.N) will combine Yahoo's (YHOO.O) search, email and messenger assets as well as advertising technology tools with its AOL unit, which it bought last year for $4.4 billion. Verizon has been looking to mobile video and advertising for new sources of revenue outside the oversaturated wireless market.The No. 1 U.S. wireless operator is betting that it can take data on more than 200 million unique monthly visitors to Yahoo sites, many of them on mobile devices, and combine it with data on 150 million or so unique monthly AOL users and data on its own user base of over 100 million wireless subscribers to offer a more targeted service for advertisers. Barclays said last month Verizon could save $500 million a year in costs of acquiring internet traffic and other expenses by buying Yahoo's internet business.The deal likely means more investment in popular content sites such as AOL’s Huffington Post and Yahoo Finance when they become part of a much larger entity.“It now becomes somewhat easier to justify investing in content,” said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research. Verizon said it would provide more detail on the strategy behind the acquisition when it announces second-quarter earnings on Tuesday.LONG WAY DOWN The deal came after activist investors led by Starboard Value LP lost faith in Yahoo Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer, who was hired in 2012, and forced what became a protracted sale process. Yahoo, founded in 1994, was a dominant player in the early days of the internet, but has long lost its leadership position in internet search and advertising to Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, Facebook Inc (FB.O) and others.Mayer said on a conference call with investors that she planned to stay at Yahoo through the deal's close. Marni Walden, head of product innovation and new business at Verizon, will head the combined internet unit and said no decisions had yet been made on the management team.""Yahoo gives us scale that is what is most critical here,"" said Walden, adding that the company's audience will go from the millions to the billions. ""We want to compete and that is the place we need to be.""Mayer, in an interview with Reuters, said she still saw a ""path to growth"" for Yahoo, especially in mobile. ""What's exciting about the Verizon transaction is that it brings us back to growth sooner,"" she said. She said she was ""open-minded"" about a possible role with the combined companies.But analysts expect AOL CEO Tim Armstrong - like Mayer a one-time Google executive - to be the driving force behind the combined companies. Yahoo is still one of the largest properties on the internet, with hundreds of millions of customers using its email, finance and sports offerings, among others, and a heavily trafficked home page.  But Google has a stranglehold on the internet search business and built an industry-leading email service, while Facebook dominates in mobile and social media. Meanwhile, traditional web banner advertising, long Yahoo's strength, has become much less lucrative in the age of mobile and video.""It's a decade of mismanagement that has finally ended for Yahoo,"" said Recon Analytics analyst Roger Entner. ""It's the continuation of an extension of Verizon's strategy toward becoming a wireless internet player and a move away from (telecom) regulation for Verizon into an unregulated growth industry.Under Armstrong, AOL has beefed up its advertising technology with a string of acquisitions, and launched the mobile video service go90. Verizon has not disclosed how financially successful the unit has been, but Armstrong, known as a formidable salesman, has clearly won the confidence of Verizon's leaders.FAR BEHIND GOOGLE, FACEBOOK  The integration of Yahoo will not come without challenges.

According to eMarketer, Yahoo is expected to generate $2.32 billion in net U.S. digital ad sales, while AOL is expected to make $1.3 billion in 2016. Facebook and Google are forecast to deliver sales of $10.3 billion and $24.63 billion, respectively, by the end of this year.The Verizon deal would transform Yahoo into a holding company, with a 15 percent stake in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) and a 35.5 percent interest in Yahoo Japan Corp (4689.T) as well as Yahoo's convertible notes, certain minority investments and its non-core patents. Yahoo executives said the remaining company is structured to ""indefinitely"" hold its Yahoo Japan and Alibaba stakes. They are worth about $40 billion based on their market capitalizations, while Yahoo had a market value of about $37.4 billion at Friday's close.Yahoo will continue as an independent company until the deal receives shareholder and regulatory approvals, the companies said. It is expected to close in early 2017. It plans to change its name and become a publicly traded investment company.Yahoo currently has $7.7 billion in cash, in addition to the $4.8 billion it will receive at the close of the deal, which it plans to return to shareholders, Yahoo executives said on the call.Verizon prevailed over rival bidders, including AT&T Inc (T.N); a group led by Quicken Loans founder Dan Gilbert and backed by billionaire Warren Buffett; private equity firm TPG Capital Management LP [TPG.UL]; and a consortium of buyout firms Vector Capital and Sycamore Partners.Under pressure from Starboard, Yahoo launched an auction of its core business in February after shelving plans to spin off its stake in Alibaba.

638,"  (Repeats for wider distribution)By Catherine NgaiNEW YORK, July 28 For the oil industry, Yahoo Inc's decision this week to sell its core business to Verizon Communications Inc for $4.8 billion does not matter all that much. Their world already changed a few months ago, when the company said it would jettison its messaging system that has been the norm for oil traders since the late 1990s.Back then, Yahoo's technology revolutionized the industry, helping usher in a new era of high-speed communication that changed the way millions of barrels of oil traded daily. For Gene Grabinski, who was trading crude in Chicago for BP Plc , one of the largest energy companies in the world, it was just the solution needed to stem the endless flood of phone calls as he bought and sold crude in the Midwest and U.S. Gulf.And it came about only because he saw his young daughters using messaging services back in the late 1990s.Come Aug. 5, Yahoo is scuttling its legacy instant messaging service as it seeks to move users to its new Messenger platform, which traders will not use because it fails to meet the industry's compliance standards. The announcement was made in June, prior to the Verizon deal. A company spokeswoman said that Yahoo will focus efforts on its new system, which will deliver better personal communication experiences to its users.For almost two decades, tens of thousands in the oil industry relied on the old Yahoo Messenger system, which launched in 1998. At that time, Grabinski was one of just two traders responsible for trading physical, domestic crude for BP, which owns some of the nation's biggest refineries including its facility in Whiting, Indiana, and previously Texas City, Texas.But Grabinski had a problem. Every day, his phone ""looked like a Christmas tree,"" he said, with red and green lights blinking as a flood of brokers called and were put on hold while Grabinski tried to gather market prices.After seeing his younger daughters, 11 and 7, use online instant messaging to chat with friends, he figured he could use the same system at work at the British major. ""The 11-year-old was on it and we were actively monitoring it at the time. I was aware of it, but I wasn't really doing it until it came up and I had the potential to use it in the work context,"" said Grabinski, who traded crude for more than a decade at BP starting in the early 1990s.EARLY ADOPTERS It is not clear how Yahoo took the industry by storm, but Grabinski was part of the first wave of oil traders to use Yahoo instant messaging, having opened his account just a year after it was launched. BP was an early adopter of the technology, and several traders said their use of Yahoo helped spur the industry forward, even though Yahoo never actively encouraged the trading community to use its service. Grabinski - now a senior crude trader at Italian oil company Eni Trading & Shipping - decided on Yahoo because it was newer than AOL's AIM chat, already used by his counterparts in power and natural gas trading. He set up a computer screen between himself and the only other domestic, physical-focused trader at the shop. Using his account, they communicated with the rest of the market.Slowly, its use became more widespread. Today, everyone from oil traders to hedge fund managers, pipeline schedulers, brokers, refinery buyers and even ship brokers uses the chat system globally.""There's a lot of back and forth, asking other people 'What are you seeing? What are you hearing?'"" said Tariq Zahir, an investment manager at Tyche Capital Advisors. FUTURE CHAT OPTIONS Oil companies are finding various solutions for communication going forward. Some large players, including Glencore Plc, have adopted Intercontinental Exchange Inc's chat. ICE said last month that it has more than 10,000 active users for its messaging system, having grown by 15 percent since January.Other chat systems include Symphony, CME Group Inc's  Pivot chat, Bloomberg chat, and Thomson Reuters Messenger. Reuters News is a division of Thomson Reuters Corp.Some have also discussed more widely used mobile options like WhatsApp, Skype or WeChat, which is popular in Asia.Grabinski said the transition to a new system should not be a problem.""Change is part of it, and you kind of just move on,"" he said.

642,"   By Henning Gloystein   (This Aug. 5 story corrects second paragraph to say Yahoo Messenger would begin shutting down on Aug. 5 and will stop working on Aug. 31, 2016.)By Henning GloysteinSINGAPORE Oil traders on Friday were lamenting the imminent demise of their main communication tool, Yahoo Messenger, which has been an industry standard since the late 1990s.Yahoo Inc said last week it would begin shutting down older versions of Yahoo Messenger on Aug. 5 and will stop working on Aug 31.Because Yahoo was free, it democratized access across market participants, as a trader only needed a computer and internet connection. The new version does not meet the industry's standards for compliance, which is why traders have to move elsewhere.Traders and analysts have been preparing for the inevitable transition this week, putting their new ICE, AOL and Skype usernames in their Yahoo messages to avoid losing contacts.""You have no idea how much I'll miss Yahoo Messenger,"" said a senior oil trader in Singapore who has been in the business for 20 years. ""I built up hundreds of contacts on it over more than a decade. I have Yahoo friends I have never met, but with whom I spent many hours bantering and joking. It also made me a lot of money. Now that it's gone, I could cry."" With Messenger's end, the highly-opaque oil industry may become even more so, given the challenge of the fragmented communication market. Some said it could force players back to the telephone. ""I think any cross-broking from one messenger platform may mean people use the old friend – the phone,"" said Matt Stanley, a fuel oil broker at Freight Investor Services in Dubai.Yahoo, which in July announced the sale of its core business unit to Verizon Communications Inc, took the oil industry by storm in the late 1990s.Its free instant messaging technology revolutionized the industry, helping usher in a new era of high-speed communication that changed the way millions of barrels of oil traded daily. But the online, follow-up version to Yahoo's standalone messaging software cannot be used by the industry. It fails to meet compliance standards because conversations cannot be saved locally.""It's kind of a pain registering and getting started again,"" said Tariq Zahir at Tyche Capital Advisors. ""It works fine, but traders are creatures of habit. You get used to it."" As a result, oil traders, brokers, analysts and also reporters covering the oil industry have been scrambling for alternatives.They include ICE's Instant Messaging; Symphony, in which 18 of the world's biggest financial institutions hold stakes; Bloomberg Messenger; Thomson Reuters' Eikon Messenger; AOL's AIM and Facebook's WhatsApp. (Additional reporting by Libby George in London and Catherine Ngai in New York; Editing by Richard Pullin, Dale Hudson and David Gaffen)",2016-08-05,YHOO,"Mon Aug 8, 2016 | 4:33am EDT",Oil traders prepare fond farewells to Yahoo Messenger,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-oil-traders-yahoo-idUSKCN10G0NL?type=companyNews

""Yahoo was great as an aggregator for all commodity participants so I think any cross-broking from one messenger platform may mean people use the old friend - the phone,"" said Matt Stanley, a fuel oil broker at Freight Investor Services in Dubai.""So in some kind of ironic way, you may see stronger relationships formed now people have to interact the old school way,"" he added.FRAGMENTED AFTERWOLD  Yahoo, which in July announced the sale of its core business unit to Verizon Communications Inc, took the oil industry by storm in the late 1990s.Its free, instant messaging technology revolutionized the industry, helping usher in a new era of high-speed communication that changed the way millions of barrels of oil traded daily.The online, follow-up version to its standalone messaging software cannot be used by the industry as it does not meet compliance standards like saving conversations. As a result, oil traders, brokers, analysts and also journalists covering the oil industry have been scrambling for alternatives, of which there are plenty, including Eikon Messenger, ICE Instant Messaging, Symphony, Bloomberg Messenger, Twitter, and WhatsApp.The inevitable fragmentation of the market is seen as a nuisance by most: one study concluded that Eikon Messenger had done well in the power, natural gas and dry-bulk markets like coal or iron ore, while ICE Instant Messenger had managed to garner much support in oil, and Symphony was heavily supported by banks.""Let's face it, it's not the end of the world. But Yahoo's beauty was that everybody used one platform,"" said one Asian fuel broker.""Now, we all use several platforms, and that's a bit of a pain,"" he added.Reuters News is a division of Thomson Reuters, which operates Eikon Messenger and competes with other systems to provide messaging services to financial markets.(Editing by Richard Pullin)",2016-08-08,YHOO,"Mon Aug 8, 2016 | 4:14am EDT","CORRECTED-As Yahoo Messenger shuts down, oil traders bid a fond farewell",http://www.reuters.com//article/oil-traders-yahoo-idUSL3N1AM27G?type=companyNews

But unprotected passwords, payment card data and bank account information did not appear to have been compromised, signaling that some of the most valuable user data was not taken.The attack on Yahoo was unprecedented in size, more than triple other large attacks on sites such as eBay Inc, and it comes to light at a difficult time for Yahoo.Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer is under pressure to shore up the flagging fortunes of the site founded in 1994, and the company in July agreed to a $4.83 billion cash sale of its internet business to Verizon Communications Inc.""This is the biggest data breach ever,""� said well-known cryptologist Bruce Schneier, adding that the impact on Yahoo and its users remained unclear because many questions remain, including the identity of the state-sponsored hackers behind it.On its website on Thursday, Yahoo encouraged users to change their passwords but did not require it.Although the attack happened in 2014, Yahoo only discovered  the incursion after August reports of a separate breach. While that report turned out to be false, Yahoo's investigation turned up the 2014 theft, according to a person familiar with the matter.Analyst Robert Peck of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey said the breach probably was not enough to prompt Verizon to abandon its deal with Yahoo, but it could call for a price decrease of $100 million to $200 million, depending on how many users leave Yahoo.Steven Caponi, an attorney at K&L Gates with a practice including merger litigation, said that Yahoo's breach could fall under the ""material adverse change"" clause common in mergers allowing a buyer to walk away if its target's value deteriorates. ""That would give Verizon the opportunity to renegotiate the terms or potentially walk away from the transaction if it is a material change. Whether it is a material change will depend in large part on what kind of information was compromised,"" Caponi said.Still, it is rare for mergers to fall apart over material changes.

RISING ATTACKS The Yahoo breach follows a rising number of other large-scale data attacks and could make it a watershed event that prompts government and businesses to put more effort into bolstering defenses, said Dan Kaminsky, a well-known internet security expert.Retailers and health insurers have been especially hard hit after high-profile breaches at Home Depot Inc, Target Corp, Anthem Inc and Premera Blue Cross.""Five hundred of the Fortune 500 have been hacked,"" he said.

653,"  (Adds comment from experts, stock moves)By Jim FinkleSept 22 Yahoo Inc this week will disclose a data breach that compromised the details of several hundred million users, technology news site Recode reported on Thursday, citing unnamed sources familiar with the company's plan.Reuters was not able to confirm the report.It was not clear how such a disclosure might affect Yahoo's plan to sell its email service and other core internet properties to Verizon Communications Inc for $4.8 billion.Representatives at Yahoo and Verizon could not be reached for comment. Shares of both companies were up 0.5 percent in late morning trading, compared with a 0.6 percent increase in the Nasdaq Composite index. If a breach is confirmed, Yahoo would likely force users to change their passwords, said Linn Freedman, a privacy attorney with Robinson & Cole LLP.But Yahoo would likely not need to notify individuals affected via mail or provide them with credit monitoring services if the scope of the breach is limited to what has been described in press reports.""If no financial information or Social Security numbers are involved, then most state laws would not require notification and credit monitoring would not be applicable,"" Freedman said. Recode's report follows an Aug. 1 story on the technology news site, Motherboard, which said a cyber criminal known as Peace was selling the data of about 200 million Yahoo users, but did not confirm its authenticity.The Motherboard report was published a week after Verizon announced its deal with Yahoo.Peace was selling that data for 3 bitcoin, or around $1,860, according to Motherboard. Details that were possibly compromised include user names, birth dates, some backup email addresses and scrambled passwords, Motherboard said. Gartner analyst Avivah Litan said that even though a breach had not been confirmed, all Yahoo users should assume their credentials were stolen and change their passwords.Stolen passwords are valuable to cyber criminals, she said, because consumers often reuse passwords. Criminals use stolen credentials for so-called ""credential stuffing"" attacks, which Litan said have surged over the past 18 months.In such attacks, criminals use automated programs to cycle through stolen user IDs and passwords and log into personal accounts on sites such as banks, travel firms and online gaming firms.While the average success rate is only 1 to 2 percent, consumers stand to lose money, credit card data, frequent flyer points and cash stored on merchant wallets, she said.(Reporting by Jim Finkle in Boston; Additional reporting by Aishwarya Venugopal in Bengaluru and Eric Auchard in Frankfurt; Editing by Ted Kerr and Bernadette Baum)",2016-09-22,YHOO,"Thu Sep 22, 2016 | 11:39am EDT",UPDATE 2-Yahoo to provide details on massive data breach - Recode,http://www.reuters.com//article/yahoo-cyber-idUSL3N1BY3BC?type=companyNews

657,"   By Dustin Volz | WASHINGTON, Sept 23  WASHINGTON, Sept 23 Yahoo on Friday faced pointed questions about exactly when it knew about a cyber attack that exposed the email credentials of 500 million users, a critical issue for the company as it seeks to prevent the breach from affecting a pending takeover by Verizon Inc.The internet company has so far not provided a clear, detailed timeline about when it was made aware of the breach announced Thursday. Yahoo blamed the incident on a ""state-sponsored actor"" but has not provided any technical information supporting that claim.""We don't know a lot. We don't know how the bad guys broke in. We don't know when Yahoo first found out,"" said Jeremiah Grossman, chief of security strategy for SentinelOne and a former information security officer at Yahoo.In a Sept. 9 regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Yahoo stated it did not have knowledge of ""any incidents of, or third party claims alleging ... unauthorized access"" of personal data of its customers that could have a material adverse effect on Verizon's acquisition. Verizon agreed in July to pay $4.83 billion for Yahoo's core business. If the hacking prompts customers to leave Yahoo, the company may see its value erode.Some lawmakers swiftly called for close scrutiny of what the company knew and when. ""As law enforcement and regulators examine this incident, they should investigate whether Yahoo may have concealed its knowledge of this breach in order to artificially bolster its valuation in its pending acquisition by Verizon,"" Richard Blumenthal, a Democratic senator from Connecticut, said.Verizon declined to comment on how the breach might affect the deal. Sources familiar with the transaction say Verizon and its advisers are still examining the situation before determining what actions if any might be taken. The Financial Times reported Thursday that embattled Yahoo Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer knew of the breach in July, citing a person briefed on the matter. Yahoo declined to comment on Friday when asked about Mayer's knowledge of the investigation. (on.ft.com/2daTJ4s)The FT article did not specify if Mayer was aware of the hack announced Thursday or of a separate incident, in which a  hacker calling himself Peace took to the dark web this summer to claim he was selling hundreds of millions of Yahoo credentials.Sources familiar with the Yahoo investigation said that the company learned of the theft of data - which included encrypted passwords, names and emails but not banking information - only after probing the claims made by Peace, which Yahoo determined were meritless.Joseph Cox, a reporter with the technology news site Motherboard, said he emailed Yahoo on July 30 to ask if the company was aware that Peace was attempting to sell Yahoo data.

659,"   By Dustin Volz  Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) said on Thursday that at least 500 million of its accounts were hacked in 2014 by what it believed was a state-sponsored actor, a theft that appeared to be the world's biggest known cyber breach by far.Cyber thieves may have stolen names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth and encrypted passwords, the company said. But unprotected passwords, payment card data and bank account information did not appear to have been compromised, signaling that some of the most valuable user data was not taken.The attack on Yahoo was unprecedented in size, more than triple other large attacks on sites such as eBay Inc (EBAY.O), and it comes to light at a difficult time for Yahoo.Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer is under pressure to shore up the flagging fortunes of the site founded in 1994, and the company in July agreed to a $4.83 billion cash sale of its internet business to Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N). ""This is the biggest data breach ever,"" said well-known cryptologist Bruce Schneier, adding that the impact on Yahoo and its users remained unclear because many questions remain, including the identity of the state-sponsored hackers behind it.On its website on Thursday, Yahoo encouraged users to change their passwords but did not require it.Although the attack happened in 2014, Yahoo only discovered  the incursion after August reports of a separate breach. While that report turned out to be false, Yahoo's investigation turned up the 2014 theft, according to a person familiar with the matter.Analyst Robert Peck of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey said the breach probably was not enough to prompt Verizon to abandon its deal with Yahoo, but it could call for a price decrease of $100 million to $200 million, depending on how many users leave Yahoo. Steven Caponi, an attorney at K&L Gates with a practice including merger litigation, said that Yahoo's breach could fall under the ""material adverse change"" clause common in mergers allowing a buyer to walk away if its target's value deteriorates.  ""That would give Verizon the opportunity to renegotiate the terms or potentially walk away from the transaction if it is a material change. Whether it is a material change will depend in large part on what kind of information was compromised,"" Caponi said. Still, it is rare for mergers to fall apart over material changes. Verizon said in a statement it was made aware of the breach within the last two days and had limited information about the matter.""We will evaluate as the investigation continues through the lens of overall Verizon interests,"" the company said.Shares of Yahoo stock closed a penny higher at $44.15, while shares of Verizon, were up about 1 percent. RISING ATTACKS The Yahoo breach follows a rising number of other large-scale data attacks and could make it a watershed event that prompts government and businesses to put more effort into bolstering defenses, said Dan Kaminsky, a well-known internet security expert.Retailers and health insurers have been especially hard hit after high-profile breaches at Home Depot Inc (HD.N), Target Corp (TGT.N), Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) and Premera Blue Cross. ""Five hundred of the Fortune 500 have been hacked,"" he said. ""If anything has changed, it's that these attacks are getting publicly disclosed.""Three U.S. intelligence officials, who declined to be identified by name, said they believed the attack was state-sponsored because of its resemblance to previous hacks traced to Russian intelligence agencies or hackers acting at their direction. Yahoo said it was working with law enforcement on the matter, and the FBI said it was investigating.""The investigation has found no evidence that the state-sponsored actor is currently in Yahoo's network,"" the company said.While the breach comprised mostly low-value information, it did include security questions and answers created by users themselves. That data could make users vulnerable if they use the same answers on other sites. A former Yahoo employee said the Q&A were deliberately left unencrypted, which allowed Yahoo to catch fake accounts more easily because fake accounts tended to reuse questions and answers.News of the massive breach at one of the nation's largest email providers may fan concern that U.S. companies and government agencies are not doing enough to improve cyber security.     Democratic Senator Mark Warner said in a statement he was ""most troubled by news that this breach occurred in 2014, and yet the public is only learning details of it today."" Technology website Recode first reported Tuesday that Yahoo planned to disclose details about a data breach affecting hundreds of millions of users.

The lawsuit seeks class-action status and unspecified damages.A Yahoo spokeswoman said the Sunnyvale, California-based company does not discuss pending litigation. The attack could complicate Chief Executive Marissa Mayer's effort to shore up the website's flagging fortunes, two months after she agreed to a $4.8 billion sale of Yahoo's Internet business to Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N).Yahoo on Thursday said user information including names, email addresses, phone numbers, birth dates and encrypted passwords had been compromised in late 2014.But the lawsuit suggested that the breach might have been warded off had Yahoo, having been targeted by hackers before, lived up to its promise of taking user privacy ""seriously"" and bulked up its security measures. It also faulted Yahoo for taking roughly three times longer than organizations typically need to uncover the breach. Yahoo demonstrated ""reckless disregard for the security of its users' personal information that it promised to protect,"" according to the complaint. Schwartz is represented by two large U.S. class-action specialists, the law firms Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd and Labaton Sucharow.The case is Schwartz v Yahoo Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 16-05456.

679,"   By Joseph Menn | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Yahoo Inc last year secretly built a custom software program to search all of its customers' incoming emails for specific information provided by U.S. intelligence officials, according to people familiar with the matter.The company complied with a classified U.S. government demand, scanning hundreds of millions of Yahoo Mail accounts at the behest of the National Security Agency or FBI, said three former employees and a fourth person apprised of the events.Some surveillance experts said this represents the first case to surface of a U.S. Internet company agreeing to a spy agency's request by searching all arriving messages, as opposed to examining stored messages or scanning a small number of accounts in real time.It is not known what information intelligence officials were looking for, only that they wanted Yahoo to search for a set of characters. That could mean a phrase in an email or an attachment, said the sources, who did not want to be identified.Reuters was unable to determine what data Yahoo may have handed over, if any, and if intelligence officials had approached other email providers besides Yahoo with this kind of request.According to two of the former employees, Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer's decision to obey the directive roiled some senior executives and led to the June 2015 departure of Chief Information Security Officer Alex Stamos, who now holds the top security job at Facebook Inc.""Yahoo is a law abiding company, and complies with the laws of the United States,"" the company said in a brief statement in response to Reuters questions about the demand. Yahoo declined any further comment.Through a Facebook spokesman, Stamos declined a request for an interview.The NSA referred questions to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which declined to comment.The request to search Yahoo Mail accounts came in the form of a classified edict sent to the company's legal team, according to the three people familiar with the matter.U.S. phone and Internet companies are known to have handed over bulk customer data to intelligence agencies. But some former government officials and private surveillance experts said they had not previously seen either such a broad demand for real-time Web collection or one that required the creation of a new computer program.""I've never seen that, a wiretap in real time on a 'selector,'"" said Albert Gidari, a lawyer who represented phone and Internet companies on surveillance issues for 20 years before moving to Stanford University this year. A selector refers to a type of search term used to zero in on specific information. ""It would be really difficult for a provider to do that,"" he added.Experts said it was likely that the NSA or FBI had approached other Internet companies with the same demand, since they evidently did not know what email accounts were being used by the target. The NSA usually makes requests for domestic surveillance through the FBI, so it is hard to know which agency is seeking the information.Reuters was unable to confirm whether the 2015 demand went to other companies, or if any complied.Alphabet Inc's Google and Microsoft Corp, two major U.S. email service providers, did not respond to requests for comment.CHALLENGING THE NSA Under laws including the 2008 amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, intelligence agencies can ask U.S. phone and Internet companies to provide customer data to aid foreign intelligence-gathering efforts for a variety of reasons, including prevention of terrorist attacks.

683,"   By Joseph Menn | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Yahoo Inc last year secretly built a custom software program to search all of its customers' incoming emails for specific information provided by U.S. intelligence officials, according to people familiar with the matter.The company complied with a classified U.S. government demand, scanning hundreds of millions of Yahoo Mail accounts at the behest of the National Security Agency or FBI, said three former employees and a fourth person apprised of the events. Some surveillance experts said this represents the first case to surface of a U.S. Internet company agreeing to an intelligence agency's request by searching all arriving messages, as opposed to examining stored messages or scanning a small number of accounts in real time.It is not known what information intelligence officials were looking for, only that they wanted Yahoo to search for a set of characters. That could mean a phrase in an email or an attachment, said the sources, who did not want to be identified. Reuters was unable to determine what data Yahoo may have handed over, if any, and if intelligence officials had approached other email providers besides Yahoo with this kind of request.According to two of the former employees, Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer's decision to obey the directive roiled some senior executives and led to the June 2015 departure of Chief Information Security Officer Alex Stamos, who now holds the top security job at Facebook Inc.""Yahoo is a law abiding company, and complies with the laws of the United States,"" the company said in a brief statement in response to Reuters questions about the demand. Yahoo declined any further comment.Through a Facebook spokesman, Stamos declined a request for an interview. The NSA referred questions to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which declined to comment. The request to search Yahoo Mail accounts came in the form of a classified edict sent to the company's legal team, according to the three people familiar with the matter.U.S. phone and Internet companies are known to have handed over bulk customer data to intelligence agencies. But some former government officials and private surveillance experts said they had not previously seen either such a broad demand for real-time Web collection or one that required the creation of a new computer program.""I've never seen that, a wiretap in real time on a 'selector,'"" said Albert Gidari, a lawyer who represented phone and Internet companies on surveillance issues for 20 years before moving to Stanford University this year. A selector refers to a type of search term used to zero in on specific information.""It would be really difficult for a provider to do that,"" he added. Experts said it was likely that the NSA or FBI had approached other Internet companies with the same demand, since they evidently did not know what email accounts were being used by the target. The NSA usually makes requests for domestic surveillance through the FBI, so it is hard to know which agency is seeking the information. Alphabet Inc's Google and Microsoft Corp, two major U.S. email service providers, separately said on Tuesday that they had not conducted such email searches.""We've never received such a request, but if we did, our response would be simple: 'No way',"" a spokesman for Google said in a statement.A Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement, ""We have never engaged in the secret scanning of email traffic like what has been reported today about Yahoo."" The company declined to comment on whether it had received such a request.CHALLENGING THE NSA Under laws including the 2008 amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, intelligence agencies can ask U.S. phone and Internet companies to provide customer data to aid foreign intelligence-gathering efforts for a variety of reasons, including prevention of terrorist attacks. Disclosures by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden and others have exposed the extent of electronic surveillance and led U.S. authorities to modestly scale back some of the programs, in part to protect privacy rights.Companies including Yahoo have challenged some classified surveillance before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a secret tribunal.

Headline and para 1 have also been corrected to remove references to soon-expiring law.)By Mark Hosenball and Dustin VolzWASHINGTON A Yahoo operation in 2015 to scan the incoming email of its customers for specific information identified by the U.S. government was authorized under a foreign intelligence law, U.S. government officials familiar with the matter said.Reuters on Tuesday reported that the Yahoo program was in response to a classified U.S. government request to scan emails belonging to hundreds of millions of Yahoo users.The revelation rekindled a long-running debate in the United States over the proper balance between digital privacy and national security.The Department of Justice obtained the order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, said the sources, who requested anonymity to speak freely.The order came under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and related specifically to Yahoo, but it is possible similar such orders have been issued to other telecom and internet companies, the sources said.   Two government sources previously said the request was issued under a provision of the law known as Section 702, but Reuters subsequently learned the information was incorrect. Section 702 will expire on Dec. 31, 2017, unless lawmakers act to renew it.In a statement on Wednesday, Yahoo said Tuesday's report by Reuters was ""misleading"" and that the ""mail scanning described in the article does not exist on our systems.""When asked to identify any specific way in which the story was misleading, or whether the operation described by Reuters had previously existed, Yahoo declined to comment.Former Yahoo employees told Reuters that security staff disabled the scan program after they discovered it, and that it had not been reinstalled before Alex Stamos, the company's former top security officer, left the company for Facebook last year.     The intelligence committees of both houses of Congress, which are given oversight of U.S. spy agencies, are now investigating the exact nature of the Yahoo order, sources said.Privacy advocates expressed alarm at the reported Yahoo program, saying it may amount to an unprecedented use of the authorities granted to the National Security Agency by Congress.Speaking to students at Georgetown University on Tuesday, former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, who leaked a trove of classified documents to journalists in 2013 exposing NSA surveillance programs, said the Yahoo report renewed questions about whether government surveillance programs are subject to sufficient congressional oversight and public scrutiny. ""That's not to say that this Yahoo program is sinister,"" Snowden said via satellite: ""It could be related to cyber security, where it is related to known malware actors.""Government officials on Wednesday sought to defend U.S. surveillance operations as appropriately balanced and transparent, though they did not deny the Reuters report.""The United States only uses signals intelligence for national security purposes, and not for the purpose of indiscriminately reviewing the emails or phone calls of ordinary people,"" Richard Kolko, a spokesman for the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence, said in a statement.  White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Tuesday that he could not confirm the existence of specific intelligence programs or intelligence tools, but defended the checks and balances placed on what information or methods the intelligence community can seek.

691,"   By Deborah M. Todd | San Francisco  San Francisco A Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) media executive fired from the internet company last year has filed a lawsuit claiming a job review process implemented by Chief Executive Marissa Mayer was used to cut men from executive ranks and lay them off illegally, court papers showed.Scott Ard, a former senior editorial director at Yahoo, filed the lawsuit in California's Northern District Court in San Jose on Tuesday, saying the company violated federal civil rights and employment regulations.Yahoo spokeswoman Carolyn Clark said in a statement that the lawsuit had no merit and called the performance review process ""fair.""The lawsuit is the second this year accusing Yahoo of discrimination against men, and targets one of the highest-profile Silicon Valley female executives, Mayer, who is in the middle of divesting Yahoo's core assets after failing to turn the company around.Ard, who joined Yahoo in 2011, argued that he had received overall positive performance reviews and stock awards before Mayer introduced a quarterly performance review (QPR) system that left him with an unsatisfactory ranking. ""Yahoo's QPR Process permitted manipulation without oversight or accountability and was thus more arbitrary and discriminatory than the stack ranking used for a while by other employees,"" the lawsuit said.It accused Yahoo of violating the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and U.S. Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification  regulations. Ard claims that since 2012, Yahoo has terminated more than 50 employees within a 30-day period on several occasions under the system, according to court documents. Yahoo had 9,400 employees as of March.The lawsuit also claims former Chief Marketing Officer Kathy Savitt ""intentionally hired and promoted women because of their gender,"" noting that 14 of about 16 senior level editorial employees hired by her were women.

692,"   By Joseph Menn | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO A U.S. senator and civil groups critical of surveillance practices on Friday called on the government to release a 2015 order by a secret court directing Yahoo to scan all its users' incoming email, saying it appeared to involve new interpretations of at least two important legal issues.Their concerns center on the nature of the technical assistance the court required Yahoo to provide and the scope of the search that legal experts said appeared to cover the Silicon Valley internet company's entire network.Yahoo installed a custom software program to search messages to hundreds of millions of accounts at the behest of U.S. intelligence officials with an order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a secret tribunal, Reuters reported on Tuesday.They were looking for messages containing a single piece of digital content, three former employees and a fourth person apprised of the events told Reuters.Intelligence officials told Reuters that all Yahoo had to do was modify existing systems for stopping child pornography from being sent through its email or filtering spam messages.But the pornography filters are aimed only at video and still images and cannot search text, as the Yahoo program did. The spam filters, meanwhile, are viewable by many employees who curate them, and there is no confusion about where they sit in the software stack and how they operate. The court-ordered search Yahoo conducted, on the other hand, was done by a module attached to the Linux kernel - in other words, it was deeply buried near the core of the email server operating system, far below where mail sorting was handled, according to three former Yahoo employees.They said that made it hard to detect and also made it hard to figure out what the program was doing. How much companies can be forced to do to comply with government orders for searching data is being debated in the courts. Companies have successfully argued that changes that would degrade users’ experience or force them to write new code, essentially a form of speech, would violate basic rights.Most famously, Apple refused to write code that would unlock an iPhone belonging to a gunman in last year's mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. The FBI later dropped its demand. In the case of Yahoo, company security staff discovered a software program that was scanning email but ended an investigation when they found it had been approved by Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer, the sources said. Lawmakers are concerned about the request and whether information about it is being properly disclosed to the public.""Recent reports of a mass-email scanning program have alleged that federal law is being interpreted in ways that many Americans would find surprising and troubling,"" said Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, a member of the intelligence committee and frequent critic of government surveillance programs.   ""The USA Freedom Act requires the executive branch to declassify Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court opinions that involve novel interpretations of laws or the Constitution,"" Wyden said.

708,"   By David Shepardson | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) said on Thursday it has a ""reasonable basis"" to believe Yahoo Inc's (YHOO.O) massive data breach of email accounts represents a material impact that could allow Verizon to withdraw from its $4.83 billion deal to buy the technology company.Verizon's general counsel Craig Silliman told reporters at a roundtable in Washington the data breach could trigger a clause in the deal that would allow the U.S. wireless company not to complete it.""I think we have a reasonable basis to believe right now that the impact is material and we're looking to Yahoo to demonstrate to us the full impact. If they believe that it's not then they'll need to show us that,"" he said, declining to comment on whether talks are under way to renegotiate the purchase price.Asked for comment, a Yahoo spokesman said: ""We are confident in Yahoo’s value and we continue to work towards integration with Verizon.""  The deal has a clause that says Verizon can withdraw if a new event ""reasonably can be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, assets, properties, results of operation or financial condition of the business.”Silliman said the U.S. Federal Trade Commission has approved Verizon's planned acquisition of Yahoo, but it still needs approval from the European Commission and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing the proxy.Verizon has had preliminary briefings from Yahoo but it still needs ""significant information"" from the company before it makes a final decision on the materiality of the hacking of at least 500 million email accounts, Silliman said. He said Verizon is ""absolutely evaluating (the breach) and will make determinations about whether and how to move forward with the deal based on our evaluation of the materiality.""Yahoo shares ended 1.75 percent lower at $41.62, while Verizon was largely unchanged, closing at $50.29, down 0.02 percent.Yahoo in September disclosed that it had fallen victim to a data breach in 2014 that compromised users’ names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth and encrypted passwords.The company has said the cyber attack was carried out by a “state-sponsored” actor, but some private security experts have challenged that assertion. Several Democratic senators have pressed Yahoo to reveal more information about the hack and why it took so long to discover. The internet firm said it learned of the breach this summer while investigating claims of a separate intrusion, but it has not provided a specific timeline of events.Some analysts suggested Verizon may be trying to get a better price. Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics, said ""Verizon is rightfully upset about Yahoo not properly disclosing the breach."" He said Yahoo would most likely have to consider renegotiating the price with Verizon, if it came to that. ""I don't think it has much of a choice. Who else would want to buy them?"" Entner said.Experts said bidders who try to extract themselves from mergers using the material adverse clause face an uphill battle. No U.S. company has ever invoked the clause successfully in court to get out of a deal.In 2013, Cooper Tire & Rubber company got cold feet about a $2.5 billion sale to Apollo Tyres and argued in the Delaware Court of Chancery that Apollo had seen a material adverse change related to union issues at a subsidiary of the company. The court rejected Cooper Tire’s claims and the deal fell apart.A Delaware court ruled in 2001 that poultry producer Tyson Foods Inc (TSN.N) could not terminate its merger with beef producer IBP Inc over accounting irregularities. The court said the shortfall was not due to a long-term problem.

709,"   By Deborah M. Todd | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Yahoo Inc reported better-than-expected quarterly adjusted profit on Tuesday, a boost for the beleaguered company whose deal to sell its core business to Verizon Communications Inc has been shaken by a massive data breach.Verizon's general counsel said last week that the hack, which affected at least 500 million email accounts in 2014, could have a material impact, possibly allowing Verizon to withdraw from the $4.83 billion deal.Tuesday's results provided at least an initial indication that the data breach has not led to a quick exodus of Yahoo customers, as some had feared. Customer trends showed growth in pageviews and email usage, Yahoo said.Still, analysts were split on whether the results dispelled doubts about the deal going through. Yahoo said in a filing with securities regulators shortly before the breach was disclosed that it knew of no cyber risks, raising questions about whether Verizon was informed of the breach in a timely fashion.  JMP Securities analyst Ronald Josey said it was too early to tell if the breach would cause lasting damage, and called customer trends ""encouraging.""""The message here is email and messaging is a very sticky product and people want to get to their messages,"" said Josey.But Fatemeh Khatibloo, a security analyst with Forrester Research, said the uptick in pageviews and email usage could be the result of ""500 million people trying to figure out if they're exposed.""Any loss of users in the future, lawsuits related to the breach and a pending Federal Communications Commission vote that could limit how telecommunications companies can use customer data may encourage Verizon to try and back out of the deal, said Khatibloo.However, Scott Kessler, an analyst with CFRA Research, said the fact that Yahoo did not see an immediate decline in users was a sign the breach may not be a material adverse change that would affect the Verizon deal. ""The bottom line here is from a fundamental operational and financial perspective, it doesn't seem like much has changed at the company over the last quarter,"" he said.Legal experts have said Verizon would have to clear a high hurdle to prove that the breach amounted to a material adverse change that would allow it to pull out of the deal.REVENUE CHALLENGES  Another positive sign for Yahoo was that revenue from Mavens - the mobile, video, native and social advertising units that Chief Executive Marissa Mayer touts as its emerging businesses - rose 24.2 percent to $524 million.Still, the business showed continuing declines in major revenue categories. Gross search revenue fell 14.1 percent to $752.5 million. Total revenue rose 6.5 percent to $1.31 billion, just beating the average analyst estimate of $1.30 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. But after deducting fees paid to partner websites, revenue fell to $857.7 million from $1 billion.Yahoo said on Friday it would not hold a call or webcast after the release of the results, citing the Verizon deal.Analysts at Needham & Co said in a note on Tuesday that decision troubled them, given doubts cast over the Verizon deal by the data hack, and they cut their rating on Yahoo to 'hold' from 'buy'.  Yahoo's shares were up about 1.3 percent in extended trading after the close on Tuesday. For the third quarter ended Sept. 30, net income attributable to Yahoo rose to $162.8 million, or 17 cents per share, from $76.3 million, or 8 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding some items, the company earned 20 cents per share, beating analysts' average estimate of 14 cents.Verizon plans to combine Yahoo's search, email and messenger assets as well as advertising technology tools with its AOL unit, which it bought last year for $4.4 billion.The deal would transform Yahoo into a holding company, with a 15 percent stake in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and a 35.5 percent interest in Yahoo Japan Corp as well as Yahoo's convertible notes, certain minority investments and its non-core patents.The deal is expected to close in early 2017, after which Yahoo plans to change its name and become a publicly traded investment company.

Excluding some items, the company earned 20 cents per share, beating analysts' average estimate of 14 cents.Verizon plans to combine Yahoo's search, email and messenger assets as well as advertising technology tools with its AOL unit, which it bought last year for $4.4 billion.The deal would transform Yahoo into a holding company, with a 15 percent stake in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and a 35.5 percent interest in Yahoo Japan Corp as well as Yahoo's convertible notes, certain minority investments and its non-core patents.The deal is expected to close in early 2017, after which Yahoo plans to change its name and become a publicly traded investment company.

720,"   By Greg Roumeliotis and Jessica Toonkel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK AT&T Inc (T.N) said on Saturday it agreed to buy Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) for $85.4 billion, the boldest move yet by a telecommunications company to acquire content to stream over its network to attract a growing number of online viewers. The biggest deal in the world this year will, if approved by regulators, give AT&T control of cable TV channels HBO and CNN, film studio Warner Bros and other coveted media assets. The tie-up will likely face intense scrutiny by U.S. antitrust enforcers  worried that AT&T might try to limit distribution of Time Warner material. AT&T will pay $107.50 per Time Warner share, half in cash and half in stock, worth $85.4 billion overall, according to a company statement. AT&T said it expected to close the deal by the end of 2017.Dallas-based AT&T said the U.S. Department of Justice would review the deal and that the companies were determining which Federal Communications Commission licenses, if any, would  be transferred to AT&T in the deal.U.S. lawmakers were already worried about cable company Comcast Corp's (CMCSA.O) $30 billion acquisition of NBCUniversal, and several argued for close regulatory scrutiny of the AT&T deal. ""Such a massive consolidation in this industry requires rigorous evaluation and serious scrutiny,"" said U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, Senate Judiciary Committee member and former attorney general of Connecticut. ""I will be looking closely at what this merger means for consumers and their pocketbooks.""U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said at a rally he would block any AT&T-Time Warner deal if he wins the Nov. 8 election. Trump has complained about media coverage of his campaign, especially by Time Warner's CNN. ""It's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,"" said Trump.Representatives of his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CONTENT PLUS DELIVERY AT&T, whose main wireless phone and broadband service business is showing signs of slowing, has already made moves to turn itself into a media powerhouse. It bought satellite TV provider DirecTV last year for $48.5 billion.  It had about 142 million North American wireless subscribers as of June 30, and about 38 million video subscribers through DirecTV and its U-verse service. New York-based Time Warner is a major force in movies, TV and video games. Its assets include the HBO, CNN, TBS and TNT networks as well as the Warner Bros film studio, producer of the “Batman” and “Harry Potter” film franchises. The company also owns a 10 percent stake in video streaming site Hulu. The HBO network alone has more than 130 million subscribers. AT&T Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson told reporters on a conference call that owning Time Warner and all its content will provide a greater competitive advantage than just continuing to license it.Talks between Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes began in August, they said. ""Jeff and I both had a vision that if you put these two together, you could innovate much faster,"" said Stephenson. Bewkes, who rejected an $80 billion offer from Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) in 2014, will stay on for an open-ended period of time to help with the integration.Stephenson called the deal ""vertical"" rather than ""horizontal"" and played down regulatory hurdles.""There's no competitor being removed from the marketplace,  there's no competitive harm that is being rendered by putting these two companies together,"" said Stephenson. ""So any concerns by the regulators, we believe, will be adequately addressed by conditions, that's our anticipation.""  Time Warner must pay AT&T $1.725 billion if it finds a different buyer. If regulators block the deal, AT&T must pay Time Warner $500 million, according to people familiar with the deal.The telecom and media sectors have been consolidating. In addition to Comcast's purchase of NBCUniversal, AT&T's wireless rival Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) is in the process of buying internet company Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) for about $4.8 billion. FINANCING AT&T said it would finance the cash portion of the purchase with new debt and cash on its balance sheet. AT&T said it has an 18-month commitment for an unsecured bridge term facility for $40 billion.AT&T has only $7.2 billion in cash on hand. Further borrowing could pressure its credit rating as it already had $120 billion in net debt as of June 30, according to Moody's. AT&T said the deal would add to earnings per share in the first year after closing. It said it expected $1 billion in annual run-rate cost savings within three years of closing, chiefly driven by lower corporate and procurement spending.Shortly after the deal was announced, AT&T reported third-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 74 cents, the same as in the year-ago period and matching Wall Street's average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It hiked its quarterly dividend by a penny to 49 cents per share. Time Warner said its third-quarter earnings, which have not yet been announced, would show growth in revenue and operating income at each division and double-digit earnings growth.5G IS COMING Owning more content gives cable and telecom companies  bargaining leverage with other content companies as customers demand smaller, hand-picked cable offerings or switch to watching online. New mobile technology including next-generation 5G networks could make a content tie-up especially attractive for wireless providers. ""We think 5G mobile is coming, we think 5G mobile is an epic game-changer,"" Rich Tullo, director of research at Albert Fried & Co, said in a research note, adding that mobile providers would be in position to disrupt traditional pay-TV services. A previous Time Warner blockbuster deal, its 2000 merger with AOL, is considered one of the most ill-advised corporate marriages on record.Perella Weinberg Partners LP, Bank of America Corp and JPMorgan Chase & Co were financial advisers to AT&T, with Bank of America and JPMorgan also offering bridge financing, while Sullivan & Cromwell LLP and Arnold & Porter LLP provided legal advice. Allen & Co LLC, Citigroup Inc and Morgan Stanley acted as financial advisers to Time Warner, while Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP was its legal adviser.

727,"   By Julia Fioretti | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS European privacy watchdogs warned WhatsApp on Friday over sharing user information with parent company Facebook, and cautioned Yahoo over a 2014 data breach and scanning of customer emails for U.S. intelligence purposes.The popular messaging service's recent change in privacy policy to start sharing users' phone numbers with Facebook - the first policy change since WhatsApp was acquired by Facebook in 2014 - has attracted regulatory scrutiny in Europe.The Italian antitrust watchdog on Friday also announced a separate probe into whether WhatsApp obliged users to agree to sharing personal data with Facebook.The European Union's 28 data protection authorities said in a statement they had requested WhatsApp stop sharing users' data with Facebook until the ""appropriate legal protections could be assured"" to avoid falling foul of EU data protection law.WhatsApp's new privacy policy involves the sharing of information with Facebook for purposes that were not included in the terms of service when users signed up, raising questions about the validity of users' consent, the authorities, known as the Article 29 Working Party (WP29), said. A spokeswoman for WhatsApp said the company was working with data protection authorities to address their questions.""We’ve had constructive conversations, including before our update, and we remain committed to respecting applicable law,” she said. Facebook has had run-ins with European privacy watchdogs in the past over its processing of users' data. However, the fines that regulators can levy are paltry in comparison to the revenues of the big U.S. tech companies concerned.The EU data protection authorities also wrote to Yahoo over a massive data breach that exposed the email credentials of 500 million users, as well as its scanning of customers' incoming emails for specific information provided by U.S. intelligence officials.They asked Yahoo to communicate all aspects of the data breach to the EU authorities, to notify the affected users of the ""adverse effects"" and to cooperate with all ""upcoming national data protection authorities' enquiries and/or investigations. ""The reports (about email scanning) are concerning to WP29 and it will be important to understand the legal basis and justification for any such surveillance activity, including an explanation of how this is compatible with EU law and protection for EU citizens,"" the watchdogs said in their letter to Yahoo.    Yahoo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The regulators will discuss the Yahoo and WhatsApp cases in November.

729,"   By Julia Fioretti | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS European privacy watchdogs warned WhatsApp on Friday over sharing user information with parent company Facebook, and cautioned Yahoo over a 2014 data breach and scanning of customer emails for U.S. intelligence purposes.The popular messaging service's recent change in privacy policy to start sharing users' phone numbers with Facebook - the first policy change since WhatsApp was acquired by Facebook in 2014 - has attracted regulatory scrutiny in Europe.The Italian antitrust watchdog on Friday also announced a separate probe into whether WhatsApp obliged users to agree to sharing personal data with Facebook.The European Union's 28 data protection authorities said in a statement they had requested WhatsApp stop sharing users' data with Facebook until the ""appropriate legal protections could be assured"" to avoid falling foul of EU data protection law.WhatsApp's new privacy policy involves the sharing of information with Facebook for purposes that were not included in the terms of service when users signed up, raising questions about the validity of users' consent, the authorities, known as the Article 29 Working Party (WP29), said. A spokeswoman for WhatsApp said the company was working with data protection authorities to address their questions.""We’ve had constructive conversations, including before our update, and we remain committed to respecting applicable law,” she said. Facebook has had run-ins with European privacy watchdogs in the past over its processing of users' data. However, the fines that regulators can levy are paltry in comparison to the revenues of the big U.S. tech companies concerned.The EU data protection authorities also wrote to Yahoo over a massive data breach that exposed the email credentials of 500 million users, as well as its scanning of customers' incoming emails for specific information provided by U.S. intelligence officials.They asked Yahoo to communicate all aspects of the data breach to the EU authorities, to notify the affected users of the ""adverse effects"" and to cooperate with all ""upcoming national data protection authorities' enquiries and/or investigations. ""The reports (about email scanning) are concerning to WP29 and it will be important to understand the legal basis and justification for any such surveillance activity, including an explanation of how this is compatible with EU law and protection for EU citizens,"" the watchdogs said in their letter to Yahoo.    Yahoo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The regulators will discuss the Yahoo and WhatsApp cases in November.

733,"   By Jennifer Saba | NEW YORK  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Yahoo is hacking out more wiggle room for Verizon. The beleaguered internet firm waited until the day after the U.S. election to reveal a hacker's July claim to have certain user data. That's when it inked a $4.8 billion sale to the telecommunications giant. The latest hit to Yahoo's reputation gives Verizon extra firepower to snag a better deal.The company led by Marissa Mayer said in a regulatory filing late Wednesday that it investigated the data thief's allegations and found it could not substantiate them. The time frame, though, only begs more questions. Yahoo agreed to sell its advertising and search units to Verizon on July 25. At the time, the company noted there were no material adverse effects on its businesses, although certain language in the merger agreement addresses security breaches and unauthorized access that gives Verizon a degree of protection.  Then in September Yahoo dropped a cyber bombshell by admitting that certain information was stolen from at least 500 million user accounts in 2014. That prompted Marni Walden, Verizon's president of innovation and new business, to stress that the company would ""protect our shareholders and our investors, so we're not going to jump off a cliff blindly."" Now it turns out that Yahoo discovered the huge breach after it started an investigation to delve into the previously undisclosed July allegation. Yahoo stands by its statement that the breach of 500 million accounts has not had a material effect on its business. That said, the company has ""subsequently incurred expenses"" related to the hack and it expects to incur ""investigatory, legal, and other expenses"" associated with it in the foreseeable future, the filing points out without providing a figure.Both sides are already in talks to try and determine how much this has hurt Yahoo's value, never mind its ever-dwindling reputation. Wednesday's revelation should give Verizon an additional cudgel at the negotiating table.

734,"   By Julia Fioretti | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS The European Commission has asked the United States about a secret court order Yahoo (YHOO.O) used to scan thousands of customer emails for possible terrorism links, following concerns that may have violated a new data transfer pact.Under the Privacy Shield agreement that came into force in August, the United States agreed to limit the collection of and access to Europeans' data stored on U.S. servers because of EU concerns about data privacy and mass U.S. surveillance.The previous deal was thrown out by the EU's top court in October 2015, leaving thousands of firms scrambling for legal ways to provide data on transactions ranging from credit cards to travel and e-commerce that underpin billions of dollars of transatlantic trade.Reuters reported last month that Yahoo had scanned all incoming customer emails in 2015 for a digital signature linked to a foreign state sponsor of terrorism, at the behest of a secret court order. That raised fresh questions about the scope of U.S. spying.""The Commission services have contacted the U.S. authorities to ask for a number of clarifications,"" Commission spokesman Christian Wigand said. The United States had pledged not to engage in mass, indiscriminate espionage, assuaging Commission concerns about the privacy of Europeans' data stored on U.S. servers following disclosures of intrusive U.S. surveillance programs in 2013 by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.Two people familiar with the matter said the Commission had now asked the United States to explain how the Yahoo order fitted with its commitments, even if the program ran before the Privacy Shield was in place. The Commission was seeking clarifications on the nature of the court order itself and how targeted it was, said one person familiar with the matter. Another said it had also asked if the program was continuing.""The U.S. will be held accountable to these commitments both through review mechanisms and through redress possibilities, including the newly established Ombudsperson mechanism in the U.S. State Department,"" Wigand said.Privacy Shield, which Yahoo has not signed up to, provides for a joint annual review to ensure the United States is respecting its commitment to limit the amount of data hoovered up by U.S. agents. A senior U.S. government official said he could not confirm or deny the reports about Yahoo, but said if true the surveillance would have been targeted at identifying terrorists while protecting the privacy of others.That would be ""good intelligence work,"" he said.

736,"   By Michael Flaherty  Starboard Value LP's quarterly filing on Monday showed more companies in its portfolio under takeover pressure from other activist investors. The New York hedge fund, led by Jeffrey Smith, is known for shaking up boards and pushing companies into mergers and acquisitions, as it did with Internet pioneer Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) earlier this year.Starboard's regulatory filing showed that it's also willing to let other activists do the agitating.Four of Starboard's new investments in the third quarter - all small positions ranging from $8 million to $16 million - were targets of other activist investors pushing the companies into a sale. One was outdoor retailer Cabelas Inc (CAB.N), which put itself on the auction block last year after pressure from Elliott Associates. Last month, Cabelas agreed to be bought by Bass Pro Shops.  Starboard also bought shares last quarter in another Elliott target, cyber security company Imperva Inc. IMPV.N. Imperva sought to hire an investment bank to seek a sale earlier this year, Reuters previously reported, though no deal has surfaced yet..  Starboard is also a new investor in Fiesta Restaurant Group Inc. (FRGI.O), which is under pressure to sell itself from activist JCP Investment Management. ""They have the expertise and believe in the strategy, so it makes sense that Starboard would invest in other activist engagements,"" said Ken Squire, founder of 13D Monitor and the 13D Activist fund, which tracks activist investors.  Investing in companies under pressure from activists or acquirers is not new to Smith. Before Starboard agitated at Yahoo, for example, activists Third Point and Carl Icahn had taken a crack at the company.Starboard's latest uptick in so-called ""event driven"" stocks comes after Starboard's hiring of William Wyatt in March 2015. Wyatt came from hedge fund Empyrean Capital and joined Starboard with the remit of allocating more money toward event driven situations such as mergers, according to people familiar with the matter. Starboard declined to comment for the story. Another activist target that Starboard bought into during the quarter was Tronc Inc. (TRNC.O), the media company that successfully fended off a hostile takeover from newspaper group Gannett Co Inc. (GCI.N). The activist publicly pushing Tronc to seal the deal was not Smith but HG Vora Capital Management. Starboard's largest new position during the quarter was a $124.7 million stake in software company Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE.N), according to the filing.

737,"   By Malathi Nayak  Verizon Communications Inc's (VZ.N) AOL digital media unit will lay off 5 percent of its workforce, or about 500 people, to consolidate operations after recent acquisitions, a person familiar with the situation said on Thursday.Most of the cuts will be in corporate units, including human resources, finance, marketing and communications, while resources will be shifted to AOL's mobile, video and data businesses, the source said. Chief Executive Officer Tim Armstrong informed employees about the cuts in an email on Thursday morning. ""Due to the deals we have done over the past 12 months, we have added over 1,500 new people to the company,"" Armstrong said in the email seen by Reuters. ""As we have settled into those changes, there are a number of areas that require consolidation to improve operations and limit the amount of hand-offs in our business processes.""  Verizon bought AOL for $4.4 billion in July of last year, betting that a push into mobile video and targeted advertising could help it tap into revenue outside the saturated wireless market.Following that, AOL struck a deal to handle much of Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) advertising technology business and bought ad tech firm Millennial Media for about $250 million.  The latest cuts do not stem from Verizon's planned purchase of Yahoo Inc's (YHOO.O) core internet properties for $4.83 billion. Verizon, the No. 1 U.S. wireless provider, said in July it plans to combine Yahoo's websites, search, email and advertising technology tools with similar assets of its AOL unit. In September, Yahoo disclosed it had suffered a data breach in 2014 involving 500 million email accounts that compromised user information. This has raised questions about whether Verizon would scrap the deal or renegotiate it. Verizon executives have said in recent weeks they are still evaluating what the data breach may mean for the Yahoo transaction.Technology news site Recode first reported the AOL job cuts in an interview with Armstrong.

The number of affected accounts was double the number implicated in a 2014 breach that the internet company disclosed in September and blamed on hackers working on behalf of a government. News of that attack, which affected at least 500 million accounts, prompted Verizon Communication Inc to say in October that it might withdraw from an agreement to buy Yahoo's core internet business for $4.83 billion. Following the latest disclosure, Verizon said, ""we will review the impact of this new development before reaching any final conclusions."" A Yahoo spokesman told Reuters that the company has been in communication with Verizon during its investigation into the breach and that it is confident the incident will not affect the  pending acquisition.Yahoo required all of its customers to reset their passwords - a stronger measure than it took after the previous breach was discovered, when it only recommended a password reset. Yahoo also said Wednesday that it believes hackers responsible for the previous breach had also accessed the company’s proprietary code to learn how to forge ""cookies"" that would allow hackers to access an account without a password.""Yahoo badly screwed up,"" said Bruce Schneier, a cryptologist and one of the world's most respected security experts. ""They weren't taking security seriously and that's now very clear. I would have trouble trusting Yahoo going forward.""Yahoo was tentative in its description of new problems, saying the incident was ""likely"" distinct from the one it reported in September and that stolen information ""may have included"" names, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers. It said it had not yet identified the intrusion that led to the massive data theft and noted that payment-card data and bank account information were not stored in the system the company believes was affected.Yahoo said it discovered the breach while reviewing data provided to the company by law enforcement. FireEye Inc’s Mandiant unit and Aon Plc's Stroz Friedberg are assisting in the investigation, the Yahoo spokesman told Reuters.The breach is the latest setback for Yahoo, an internet pioneer that has fallen on hard times in recent years after being eclipsed by younger, fast-growing rivals including Alphabet Inc's Google and Facebook Inc.  Hours before it announced the breach on Wednesday, executives with Google, Facebook and other large U.S. technology companies met with President-elect Donald Trump in New York.

Verizon has threatened to go to court to get out of the deal if it is not repriced, citing a material adverse effect, said the people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential.No court in Delaware, where Yahoo is incorporated, has ever found that a material adverse effect has occurred that would allow companies to terminate a merger agreement. Nevertheless, the threat of a court case on the issue has been successfully used by companies to renegotiate deals, and experts said that some concessions from Yahoo are likely, given the magnitude of the cyber security breaches. Renegotiating the deal’s price tag would be the simplest but also least likely scenario because the impact of the data breaches will not be apparent for some time, according to Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. A more likely concession would be for Yahoo to agree to compensate Verizon after the close of the deal, based on the liabilities that occur. The two companies may also agree to extend the close of the deal to allow for more time for information to come in on the impact of the breaches, Gordon suggested.Verizon shares rose 0.4 percent to close at $51.81, in line with the S&P 500 Index .SPX. Yahoo closed down 6.1 percent at $38.41. BIGGEST BREACH  Yahoo said late on Wednesday that it had uncovered a 2013 cyber attack that compromised data of more than 1 billion user accounts, the largest known breach on record.  It said the data stolen may have included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers.The company added that some of its partners were affected. One such partner, Europe's Sky Plc (SKYB.L), said Yahoo provides email services to its 2.1 million Sky.com email account holders, but it was unclear how many of those accounts were affected. The announcement followed Yahoo's disclosure in September of a separate breach that affected over 500 million accounts, which the company said it believed was launched by different hackers. The White House said on Thursday the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation was probing the breach. Several lawsuits seeking class-action status on behalf of Yahoo shareholders have been filed, or are in the works.Meanwhile, Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia said he was looking into Yahoo's cyber security practices. ""This most-recent revelation warrants a separate follow-up and I plan to press the company on why its cyber defenses have been so weak as to have compromised over a billion users,"" he said in a statement.Warner, who will become the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee next year, described the hacks as ""deeply troubling."" New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman urged anyone with a Yahoo account to change their passwords and security questions and said he is examining the breach's circumstances and the company's disclosures to law enforcement. Germany's cyber security authority, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), advised German consumers to consider switching to safer alternatives for email, and criticized Yahoo for failing to adopt modern encryption techniques to protect users' personal data.""Considering the repeated cases of data theft, users should look more closely at which services they want to use in the future and security should play a part in that decision,"" BSI President Arne Schoenbohm said in a statement.The latest breach drew widespread criticism from security experts, several advising consumers to close their Yahoo accounts.""Yahoo has fallen down on security in so many ways I have to recommend that if you have an active Yahoo email account, either direct with Yahoo of via a partner like AT&T, get rid of it,"" Stu Sjouwerman, chief executive of cyber security firm KnowBe4 Inc, said in a broadly distributed email. A Yahoo spokesperson, in response to criticism of the company's security measures, said on Thursday: ""We’re committed to keeping our users secure, both by continuously striving to stay ahead of ever-evolving online threats and to keep our users and platforms secure.""

746,"   By Joseph Menn, Jim Finkle and Dustin Volz | SAN FRANCISCO/BOSTON/WASHINGTON  SAN FRANCISCO/BOSTON/WASHINGTON In the summer of 2013, Yahoo Inc launched a project to better secure the passwords of its customers, abandoning the use of a discredited technology for encrypting data known as MD5.It was too late. In August of that year, hackers got hold of more than a billion Yahoo accounts, stealing the poorly encrypted passwords and other information in the biggest data breach on record. Yahoo only recently uncovered the hack and disclosed it last week.The timing of the attack might seem like bad luck, but the weakness of MD5 had been known by hackers and security experts for more than a decade. MD5 can be cracked more easily than other so-called ""hashing"" algorithms, which are mathematical functions that convert data into seemingly random character strings. In 2008, five years before Yahoo took action, Carnegie Mellon University's Software Engineering Institute issued a public warning to security professionals through a U.S. government-funded vulnerability alert system: MD5 ""should be considered cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use.""Yahoo's failure to move away from MD5 in a timely fashion was an example of problems in Yahoo's security operations as it grappled with business challenges, according to five former employees and some outside security experts. Stronger hashing technology would have made it more difficult for the hackers to get into customer accounts after breaching Yahoo's network, making the attack far less damaging, they said.""MD5 was considered dead long before 2013,"" said David Kennedy, chief executive of cyber firm TrustedSec LLC. ""Most companies were using more secure hashing algorithms by then."" He did not name specific firms.Yahoo, which has confirmed it was still using MD5 at the time of the attack, disputed the notion that the company had skimped on security.""Over the course of our more than 20-year history, Yahoo has focused on and invested in security programs and talent to protect our users,"" Yahoo said in a statement to Reuters. ""We have invested more than $250 million in security initiatives across the company since 2012.""COMPETING PRIORITIES The former Yahoo security staffers, however, told Reuters the security team was at times turned down when it requested new tools and features such as strengthened cryptography protections, on the grounds that the requests would cost too much money, were too complicated, or were simply too low a priority. Partly, that reflected the internet pioneer's long-running financial struggles: Yahoo's revenues and profits have fallen steadily since their 2008 peak while Alphabet Inc's Google, Facebook Inc and others have come to dominate the consumer internet business. ""When business is good, it's easy to do things like security,"" said Jeremiah Grossman, who worked on Yahoo's security team from 1999 to 2001. ""When business is bad, you expect to see security get cut.""To be sure, no system is completely hack-proof. Hackers have managed to break into passwords that were encrypted using more advanced technologies than MD5. Other Internet companies, such as LinkedIn and AOL, have also suffered security breaches, though none nearly as large as Yahoo's.""This could happen to any large corporation,"" said Tom Kellermann, a former World Bank security manager and security industry executive.Kellermann, now CEO of investment firm Strategic Cyber Ventures, said he was not surprised that it had taken Yahoo several years to identify the massive attacks. ""Hackers often have a capacity to burrow deeper than we thought into a system and remain for years,"" he said. Reuters could not determine how many companies besides Yahoo were using MD5 in 2013. Google, Facebook and Microsoft Corp did not immediately respond to requests for comment. According to another former security veteran at Yahoo, even when the company was growing quickly, security sometimes took a back seat as the company focused on system performance to keep up with the growth. Then, when growth stalled, senior security staff left for other companies and the chances of getting approval for expensive upgrades dropped further, the person said.""Any changes to the user database took forever because they were understaffed, and it's an ultra-critical system - everything depends on it,"" said the former Yahoo employee.Yahoo declined to comment on details of its security practices, but said it routinely conducted drills to test and improve its cyber defenses and highlighted campaigns such as a ""bug bounty"" program in which it pays hackers to find security flaws and report them to the company. TWO BIGGEST BREACHES  Last September, Yahoo disclosed a 2014 cyber attack that affected at least 500 million customer accounts, the biggest known data breach at the time. Following last week's news of the even bigger 2013 breach, U.S. federal investigators and lawmakers said they are scrutinizing Yahoo's security practices, and Verizon Communications Inc is seeking to renegotiate a July deal to buy Yahoo's internet business for $4.8 billion. The former Yahoo employees said the company's security problems began before the arrival of Chief Executive Marissa Mayer in 2012 and continued under her tenure. Yahoo had suffered attacks by Russian hackers for years, two of the former staffers said. In 2014, Yahoo hired a new security chief, Alex Stamos, and one of the security crews he led - known internally as 'The Paranoids' - thought they were making headway against the hackers, former employees said. In 2015, when the security crew discovered a hidden program attached to Yahoo's email servers that was monitoring all incoming messages, their first thought was that the Russian hackers had come back.It turned out that the program had been installed by Yahoo's email engineers to comply with a secret surveillance order requested by a U.S. intelligence agency, as Reuters previously reported. Stamos and some of his staff left Yahoo soon after that, creating further disruptions to security operations.    This week, in addition to disclosing the 2013 hack, Yahoo said someone had accessed its proprietary computer code to learn how to forge ""cookies,"" which would allow hackers to access an account without passwords. Yahoo said it connected some cookie-forging activity to the same state-sponsored actor it believed was responsible for the 2014 data theft.""They burrowed in and got access to everything,"" said Dan Guido, chief executive of cyber security firm Trail of Bits. On Thursday, Germany's cyber security authority criticized Yahoo for failing to adopt adequate encryption techniques and advised German consumers to switch to other email providers. Yahoo told Reuters it was committed to keeping users secure by staying ahead of new threats. ""Today's security landscape is complex and ever-evolving, but, at Yahoo, we have a deep understanding of the threats facing our users and continuously strive to stay ahead of these threats to keep our users and our platforms secure.""
