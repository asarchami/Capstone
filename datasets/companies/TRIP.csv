Genstar declined to comment while spokespeople for TravelClick and Evercore had no immediate comment.Founded in 1999, New York City-based TravelClick provides technology for guest reservations and website development to more than 36,000 hotel clients in over 160 countries, according to its website. The company generated revenues of $257 million in 2012, according to Moody's Investors Service Inc. TravelClick's internet booking engine is facing increasing competition from travel websites such as TripAdvisor Inc , which are developing their own interfaces that allow for direct booking of hotel rooms. Genstar acquired TravelClick in December 2007 for an undisclosed amount from private equity firm Bain Capital LLC and TravelClick co-founders Richard Gray and Ray Cohen. Bain's venture capital arm made a new investment in TravelClick at the time, taking a minority stake.Last week, Sabre Corp, the owner of online travel agency Travelocity and a competitor of TravelClick in software applications to the hotel industry, filed for an initial public offering. Sabre was taken private in 2007 by private equity firms TPG Capital LP and Silver Lake for $5 billion, including debt.",2014-01-27,TRIP,"Mon Jan 27, 2014 | 2:58pm EST",Hotel bookings software company TravelClick up for sale -sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/travelclick-sale-idUSL2N0L11HU20140127?type=companyNews

While the market has bounced back strongly from its recent selloff, the energy sector remains under pressure from plunging oil prices. The price of U.S. crude oil hit its lowest in three years after Saudi Arabia cut sales prices to the United States.  Crude settled down $1.59 at $77.19 after reaching the lowest intraday price since October 2011 in the morning.Adding to worries about global demand, the European Commission said the euro zone will need another year to reach even modest economic growth. A Reuters report said central bankers in the euro zone plan to challenge European Central Bank President Mario Draghi's leadership style.""Eventually, a slowdown in Europe could affect large U.S. companies. So far, we have not seen much influence, at least in earnings reports. Next quarter could really be indicative of whether a slowdown in Europe is actually having an effect here,"" said Bryant Evans, portfolio manager at Cozad Asset Management in Champaign, Illinois.Among other top negative influences, Priceline Group Inc  shares dropped 8.4 percent to $1,097.70, one of the largest percentage decliners on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, after it forecast quarterly earnings below Wall Street's expectations. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 17.6 points, or 0.1 percent, to 17,383.84, the S&P 500 lost 5.71 points, or 0.28 percent, to 2,012.1 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 15.27 points, or 0.33 percent, to 4,623.64.The Dow Jones transportation average rose 0.4 percent and posted another record high close.The session closed with all eyes on today's U.S. elections, where a handful of Senate races could hold the key to whether the stock market glides through the year-end in a typical post-midterm election rally or gets hit with a fresh bout of volatility. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd rose 4.3 percent to $106.07 on massive volume after the Chinese e-commerce company reported its first quarterly results as a public company, posting revenue growth of 53.7 percent.The company is one of the largest in the world, but its rise did not directly translate to major indexes as it is not a component of the Dow or S&P 500 and is not traded on the Nasdaq.Among the day's other big decliners, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc lost 5.8 percent to $372.39 after it cut the top end of its full-year sales outlook for its blockbuster eye drug. But the company also said it is consulting with government agencies to see if its technology might be used to fight Ebola.After the bell, shares of TripAdvisor dropped 13.9 percent to $72.08 following the release of its results.During the regular session, about 7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, compared with the 7.3 billion average for the last five sessions, according to data from BATS Global Markets.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,837 to 1,231, for a 1.49-to-1 ratio on the downside.

Some weak earnings in the tech sector capped gains in the Nasdaq, but the beaten-down energy sector rallied on hopes a Republican majority could lead to new legislation that impacts the group. That includes approval of oil and gas pipelines and reforms of crude and natural gas export laws.Energy shares had lagged recently, suffering massive losses as crude oil prices plunged to a three-year low. The S&P energy index was the only one of ten primary S&P 500 sectors to be negative for the year, though it rose 1.6 percent as the strongest group of the day.Equities rose on relief that election results were clear, with the upcoming Senate majority party not in doubt. Investors had been concerned that some close races would be forced into run-offs, an outcome that could have led to weeks of delay in knowing which party would control Congress's upper chamber. ""It had looked like some of the races would be very close and that we might not know who controlled the Senate, but in the end the results were pretty decisive,"" said John Carey, portfolio manager at Pioneer Investment Management in Boston. ""That's good news for the industries that had been subject to regulatory issues.""U.S. private employers added 230,000 jobs in October, more than expected and the most since June, according to the ADP National Employment report. The data could raise hopes for Friday's closely-watched payroll report.Separately, the pace of growth in the U.S. services sector slowed more than expected in October, sliding for a second month to its lowest level since June, according to the Institute for Supply Management's services index. Time Warner Inc rose 2.9 percent to $77.16 after it reported revenue growth of 3 percent.

39,"  (Adds company and analyst comment, details from earnings call)By Jeffrey DastinFeb 19 Priceline Group Inc reported quarterly profit that beat Wall Street expectations on Thursday but forecast first-quarter revenue below estimates due largely to foreign exchange volatility.Priceline, the world's largest online travel services company by bookings, said fourth-quarter profit rose nearly 20 percent from the year-earlier period to about $452 million. It earned $10.85 per non-GAAP diluted share, while analysts, on average, estimated non-GAAP earnings per share of $10.10.Revenue totaled $1.84 billion versus $1.54 billion a year ago. Analysts were looking for $1.8 billion in the latest quarterThe company also said its board authorized a share buyback of up to $3 billion. While Priceline narrowly topped rival Expedia Inc  for gross bookings last quarter, its lower-than-expected first-quarter forecasts reflected weakening results due to a stronger U.S. dollar, just as U.S. domestic competition heats up following Expedia's acquisition of Travelocity in January and the planned purchase of Orbitz Worldwide Inc, announced earlier this month.Priceline said it expects revenue to increase between 4 percent and 11 percent in the first quarter, or up to $1.82 billion. Analysts had estimated $1.86 billion.""The guidance was a little disappointing,"" said S&P Capital IQ analyst Tuna Amobi. ""With Expedia buying Travelocity, I think the domestic competition can only intensify. (However)international can continue to do the heavy lifting for them."" During Priceline's quarterly earnings call, Chief Executive Officer Darren Huston said the company did not view Expedia's acquisition spree as a negative because the deal ""consolidates and clarifies competition.""""We just have a different philosophy for growing in the long term,"" he added. Priceline prefers to buy companies that complement its business rather than acquire additional travel booking sites such as Orbitz, he said. Amobi said online travel companies will continue to make acquisitions, and noted the speculation that TripAdvisor Inc  could be a strategic buy for Priceline. But Amobi said that TripAdvisor's two classes of stock and its ties to Expedia, its former owner, could complicate a deal.Priceline said it was focused on growth in the vacation rental business despite increasing competition.Meanwhile, foreign exchange volatility will affect its operating results, even with currency hedges in place.""Although the stronger (U.S.) dollar has a significant negative impact on our growth expressed in dollars, the fundamental performance of our business is still evident,"" Chief Financial Officer Daniel Finnegan said during the call.

43,"  MILAN, July 14 An Italian court has cancelled a fine against online travel company TripAdvisor for allegedly publishing misleading information in its reviews, overturning an order by the country's competition authority.TripAdvisor, a website that gathers reviews of hotels and restaurants from its users, was fined 500,000 euros ($550,450) last year by the competition watchdog following an investigation into whether it took appropriate measures to avoid publishing false opinions while presenting them as genuine. However the U.S. company appealed against the decision, and the fine was overturned by a Rome-based administrative court. The ruling, which was seen by Reuters, was made available to the parties involved in the case on Monday. In an emailed statement on Tuesday, TripAdvisor said it was satisfied with the ruling which it said confirmed that it did not mislead readers regarding the source of its reviews. It added that the processes it used to maintain the integrity of its content were extremely effective.
