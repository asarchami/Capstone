0,"  LONDON Jan 14 Credit card company Visa  has become the fifth major company to extend its World Cup sponsorship until 2022, FIFA said on Tuesday.Visa, which is also an Olympic sponsor, became a FIFA partner in the run-up to the 2010 World Cup.It replaced rival MasterCard which won a $90 million legal settlement from soccer's ruling body FIFA after claiming it should have been given first refusal on a new deal. Financial terms of the new contract with Visa were not disclosed. It will cover the 2018 World Cup in Russia and the tournament four years later in Qatar.""Our association with the FIFA World Cup and the entire portfolio of FIFA events differentiates our brand and allows us to offer unique opportunities to our clients around the world,"" said Ricardo Fort who is responsible for global sponsorship and marketing at Visa. MasterCard remains involved in soccer sponsorship through the European Champions League. German sportswear company Adidas has signed up as a FIFA sponsor until 2030 while Coca-Cola, Hyundai-Kia and Anheuser-Busch InBev have renewed until 2022.FIFA generated $370 million from marketing in 2012, out of total revenues of $1.166 billion.",2014-01-14,V,"Tue Jan 14, 2014 | 9:58am EST",Soccer-Visa extends World Cup sponsorship to 2022,http://www.reuters.com//article/soccer-world-visa-idUSL3N0KO43020140114?type=companyNews
1,"  *    (Adds details)By Tanya Agrawal and David HenryJan 14 JPMorgan Chase & Co reported a better-than-expected adjusted quarterly profit as the biggest U.S. bank kept a lid on costs and set aside less money to cover bad loans.The bank, which agreed last week to pay $2.6 billion to settle government and private claims over its handling of accounts of fraudster Bernie Madoff, said fourth-quarter net income fell 7.3 percent to $5.28 billion, or $1.30 per share.Adjusted for special items, the company earned $1.40 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.35, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The results took into account gains from the sale of Visa Inc shares and One Chase Manhattan Plaza and legal expenses related to the Madoff settlements.JPMorgan, which agreed to pay nearly $20 billion in 2013 to settle assorted legal claims, had estimated that settlement of the Madoff claims would subtract $850 million from fourth-quarter earnings.""It was in the best interests of our company and shareholders for us to accept responsibility, resolve these issues and move forward,""  Chairman and Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in a statement on Tuesday.JPMorgan shares, which have been trading this month at their highest levels since 2000, were up 0.5 percent at $58 before the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock rose 33 percent in 2013, in line with the 35 percent rise in the KBW Bank index and slightly ahead of the 29 percent gain in Standard & Poor's 500 stock index.Special items highlighted by the bank subtracted 10 cents per share from fourth-quarter earnings, compared with a two-cent boost in the same quarter of 2012.The special items included a benefit of 21 cents per share from the sale of Visa shares and 8 cents from the sale of One Chase Manhattan Plaza and an expense of 27 cents per share from legal bills, including the Madoff settlements.Three months ago, JPMorgan reported its first quarterly loss under Dimon after recording after-tax expenses of $7.2 billion to settle government and private investigations. The allegations involved, among other things, shoddy dealing in mortgage instruments before the financial crisis, derivatives trading in London and pricing in electric power markets, as well as failing to report suspicions of wrongdoing by Madoff.Investors have been looking for reassurance from the company that the worst of its legal expenses are behind it.ASSETS SHRINK  Noninterest expenses fell 3 percent to $15.55 billion during the quarter, while provisions for bad loans fell 84 percent to $104 million.JPMorgan said its assets shrank to $2.42 trillion at the end of December from $2.46 trillion three months before and $2.36 trillion a year earlier, but it remains the biggest U.S. bank by that measure.Equity underwriting revenue soared 65 percent to $436 million. But investment banking fees were pulled down by lower debt underwriting, where revenue declined 19 percent, and advisory fees, which fell 7 percent. Altogether, investment banking fees declined 3 percent.The bank's market share in equity underwriting rose to 8.3 percent in 2013, moving it to second place in the industry from fourth. Goldman Sachs Group Inc led with 11.4 percent.Higher interest rates on home mortgage loans weighed on JPMorgan, like the rest of the banking industry.JPMorgan lost $274 million, pre-tax, making mortgage loans, compared with a profit of $789 million a year earlier as margins declined and as the company was unable to reduce expenses as quickly as lending volumes declined.The bank said it expected to lose money making mortgages again in the first quarter of this year.Reflecting a slowdown in loan refinancing, total U.S. home mortgage borrowing was down 50 percent at the end of December compared with a year earlier and down by a quarter from the end of September, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.

2,"  By Ross KerberBOSTON Jan 13 A rash of data breaches at big U.S. retailers may accelerate spending on high-tech payment cards, a MasterCard Inc executive and other industry specialists said on Monday, as companies look to keep the faith of their customers.Retailers and their banks face a deadline set by payment networks Visa Inc and MasterCard of October 2015 to accept new payment cards that store information on computer chips rather than on traditional magnetic stripes. The multibillion-dollar safety upgrade has many companies dragging their feet, and analysts estimated only 60 percent of U.S. sales terminals would meet the schedule.Now the loss of customer data reported at Target Corp, Neiman Marcus and other stores since December could move companies to the new standard more quickly, said Carolyn Balfany, head of U.S. product delivery for MasterCard in a telephone interview on Monday.The risks created by the breaches will clarify to companies the benefit of moving quickly to the new standard, she said.

Visa has not made executives available to be interviewed since Target first reported its breach on Dec. 19.A response gaining attention among security specialists has been the conversion of U.S. sales terminals to a card standard widely used in Europe and Asia, sometimes known as ""EMV"" after the initials of its creator companies Europay, MasterCard and Visa. Cards meeting the standard carry chips to make them harder to counterfeit, and to protect sensitive data with encryption. They can also require users to enter a personal identification number, or PIN, to make purchases, an extra layer of security compared to the signatures used by traditional credit cards.Although the new technology may not have prevented the data thefts from Target and elsewhere, it would make any stolen data harder to re-use and has cut fraud where it has been adopted.BANKS AND RETAILERS AT ODDS  In an interview with CNBC on Monday, Target Chief Executive Gregg Steinhafel said the company wanted to lead the retail industry's move to adopt the new cards.

4,"   By Ross Kerber | BOSTON  BOSTON Jan 14 Companies that help Target Corp  process payments could face millions of dollars in fines and costs resulting from the unprecedented data breach that struck the retailer over the holiday shopping season.Investigators are still sorting through just how thieves  compromised about 40 million payment cards and the information of about 70 million Target customers. But people who have reviewed past data breaches believe Target's partners could face consumer lawsuits and fines that payment networks such as  Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc often levy after cyber security incidents.Target's partners ""have deep pockets and are intimately involved in certain aspects of how Target gets paid,"" said Jamie Pole, a cyber security consultant in Asheboro, North Carolina, who works for government agencies and the financial industry.Fines and settlement costs could reach into the millions of dollars for individual companies, he said, though much will depend on how the ultimate liability for the breach is determined.Boston attorney Cynthia Larose of Mintz Levin said Target would likely seek to add its partners as defendants to lawsuits already filed over the breach. ""These class-action lawsuits start to bring everyone in at some point,"" she said.After its systems were penetrated by hackers in the mid-2000s, retailer TJX Companies Inc agreed to pay up to $40.9 million to cover fraud costs in a settlement with Visa. Visa also issued penalties of $880,000 against Fifth Third Bancorp of Ohio, which processed transactions for TJX.Asked about the business relationships and possible costs, Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder declined to comment, citing the ongoing investigation and pending suits. A Visa spokeswoman declined to comment. A MasterCard spokesman said the company could not discuss an ongoing investigation. HANDLING TARGET TRANSACTIONS Several companies are involved in any purchase from a store such as Target. A bank issues the consumer's payment card, while a separate organization known as the ""merchant acquirer"" handles the payment for the store, when the card is swiped. Companies such as Visa and MasterCard operate the networks over which the payment request and confirmation are sent.Companies performing these roles for Target were identified in a research note by Robert W. Baird & Co analysts on Dec. 19. According to the note the merchant acquirer used by Target for credit and debit card transactions is Bank of America Merchant Services, a joint venture of Bank of America Corp  and KKR & Co's First Data Corp.A spokesman for the joint venture declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Bank of America. Bank of America is due to release earnings on Wednesday morning. A spokeswoman for First Data, Nancy Etheredge, said via email that the company ""processes some transactions for one of Target's merchant acquirers"" but declined to offer more detail.The note also identified Vantiv Inc of Cincinnati as processing transactions for Target customers who type in personal identification numbers for debit transactions. It said Vantiv expected ""no impact from the breach."" Vantiv representatives did not return messages. Target-branded payment cards are issued by Toronto's TD Bank Group. A spokeswoman said via e-mail that ""It would be inappropriate to comment on any potential fines at this time.""One author of the Baird report, analyst Timothy Wojs, said it is too soon to predict what fines or settlement costs might result. In the past, fines by Visa and MasterCard have been insignificant to payment processors but set the stage for larger settlements to cover bank losses, he said.FINING THE MIDDLEMEN Fines in cyber cases have drawn some push-back from merchants. In a case in U.S. District Court in Nashville, Tennessee, specialty retailer Genesco Inc Inc is suing Visa over the $13.3 million it says Visa wrongfully collected from its banks, Wells Fargo & Co and Fifth Third.Visa collected the money after a cyber-attack obtained payment data, though the data was handled within industry standards, according to the company's complaint.Wells Fargo declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Fifth Third did not respond to questions. In court filings Visa defended its actions as in keeping with laws and contracts.",2014-01-15,V,"Tue Jan 14, 2014 | 9:31pm EST",Target data breach could be costly for payment partners,http://www.reuters.com//article/target-databreach-banks-idUSL2N0KO11020140115?type=companyNews

AmEx jumped 3.6 percent to $90.97 a day after reporting quarterly results. Intel's stock slid 2.6 percent to $25.85 and was among the top weights on each of the three major U.S. stock indexes, a day after the chipmaker gave a lukewarm forecast for first-quarter revenue and posted fourth-quarter earnings that missed expectations by a penny.General Electric shares dropped 2.3 percent to $26.58 after the conglomerate reported disappointing 2013 profit margins.But at least some of the day's move could have been options related.""January options expiration tends to be among the most volatile, and today's an example of that,"" said Bruce Zaro, chief technical strategist of Delta Global Asset Management in Boston.

6,"   By Jim Finkle | BOSTON  BOSTON A cybercrime firm says it has uncovered at least six ongoing attacks at U.S. merchants whose credit card processing systems are infected with the same type of malicious software used to steal data from Target Corp.Andrew Komarov, chief executive of the cybersecurity firm IntelCrawler, told Reuters that his company has alerted law enforcement, Visa Inc and intelligence teams at several large banks about the findings. He said payment card data was stolen in the attacks, though he didn't know how much.IntelCrawler's findings are the latest sign that the cyberattacks disclosed by Target Inc and upscale department store Neiman Marcus are part of a wider assault on U.S. retailer customer data security.On Thursday, the U.S. government and the private security intelligence firm iSIGHT Partners warned merchants and financial services firms that the BlackPOS software used against No. 3 U.S. retailer Target had been used in a string of other breaches at retailers - but did not say how many or identify the victims.Credit card companies, banks and retailers say that victims of any fraud resulting from the theft of their payment card data bear ""zero liability"" and will be credited for fraudulent purchases made on their accounts.""Our rules say five days, but most consumers get (their money) back within 24 hours,"" Visa spokeswoman Rosetta Jones said.Yet consumer advocates said that any debit card fraud could result in money being drained from a bank, mutual fund or other cash account at a time when those funds were really needed.""Even if you are able to recover the money later, that's going to cause you an awful lot of pain and heartburn,"" said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, a nonprofit advocacy group.Data breaches can also be costly for the retailers and credit card firms affected, along with the companies that process the payments, people who have reviewed past attacks say. LATEST ATTACKS Komarov, an expert on cybercrime who has helped law enforcement investigate previous attacks, told Reuters on Friday that retailers in California and New York were among those compromised by BlackPOS. Reuters was unable to confirm their names.Komarov said he has not directly contacted those merchants. Security experts typically report cybercrimes through law enforcement rather than going directly to victims because the process can be time-consuming and victims are often suspicious when they first learn of attacks.BlackPOS was developed by a hacker whose nickname is ""Ree4"" and who is now about 17 years old and living in St. Petersburg, Russia, according to Los Angeles-based IntelCrawler.The teenager sold the malicious software to cybercriminals who then launched attacks on merchants, said Komarov, who has been monitoring Ree4's activities since March. Komarov declined to specifically identify the sources of his intelligence, though he said he has been monitoring criminal forums where Ree4 sells his software and posted an excerpt of a chat with a client on the IntelCrawler website.Officials with the Russian Interior Ministry could not be reached for comment when Reuters attempted to contact them after office hours on Friday.The bulk of the attacks have occurred in the United States, but about 30 percent have occurred in other countries, including Australia and Canada, Komarov said.Target last month disclosed the theft of some 40 million payment card numbers in a breach uncovered over the holiday shopping season, and later reported that 70 million customers' records had also been taken. Neiman Marcus last week said that it too was victim of a cyberattack. Sources have told Reuters that at least three other well-known national retailers have been attacked.John Watters, chief executive of iSIGHT Partners, which is helping the U.S. Secret Service with its investigation into the attacks, said that he expects the pace of assaults on merchants to pick up.Copycats will pile on, using similar software, which can be purchased on underground forums, and similar techniques to launch attacks on retailers, he said. ""They are saying: 'This is a great idea.'""BlackPOS is a type of RAM scraper, or memory-parsing software, which enables cybercriminals to grab encrypted data by capturing it when it travels through the live memory of a computer, where it appears in plain text.It is derived from code that has been floating around underground cybercrime forums since at least 2005 and may be related to malicious software used in attacks as early as 2003, said Shane Shook, an executive with cybersecurity firm Cylance Inc who has helped investigate major breaches at retailers.While the technology has been around for many years, its use has increased as retailers have improved their security, making it more difficult for hackers to obtain credit card data using other approaches.It succeeded in evading detection by anti-virus software when it infected the Windows-based point-of-sales terminals at retailers like Target, according to the report that the government privately distributed to merchants on Thursday, which iSIGHT Partners helped prepare.Officials with the Secret Service could not immediately be reached for comment.(Additional reporting by Richard Valdmanis, Lisa Baertlein, Mark Hosenball, David Henry and Megan Davis; Editing by Richard Valdmanis, Chizu Nomiyama and Jonathan Oatis)",2014-01-17,V,"Fri Jan 17, 2014 | 3:45pm EST",Exclusive: Cybercrime firm says uncovers six active attacks on U.S. merchants,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-target-databreach-idUSBREA0G18P20140117?type=companyNews

16,"  SHANGHAI, March 12 In UnionPay's curved glass headquarters in Shanghai's financial hub of Pudong, a plaque commemorates a visit by former Chinese President Hu Jintao in 2010. Emblazoned on it is a quote from Hu urging the company to ""step up the effort to internationalize and strive to build UnionPay into a major global brand for bankcards"".China's renminbi currency is not yet an international currency - it is not freely convertible. Yet China's official bank card has achieved Hu's dream of global dominance.China UnionPay has become the world's largest card brand with 3.53 billion cards in circulation, just over a decade after it was founded in 2002. Its $2.5 trillion in transactions in the first half of last year was second to Visa Inc's $4.6 trillion, says industry newsletter the Nilson Report.UnionPay has achieved this kind of dominance by having a virtual monopoly on bank card transactions in China, and according to its rivals, offering low fees to retail merchants at home and abroad.In China, foreign rivals such as American Express, MasterCard Inc and Visa must use UnionPay's yuan settlement network.Credit and debit card settlement is a big, profitable and growing business in China. Interbank card transactions jumped 37 percent from 2011 to 21.8 trillion yuan ($3.58 trillion) in 2012. Central bank regulations also give UnionPay the rights to settlements for all online transactions in China. UnionPay transactions overseas show equally impressive growth, rising 30 percent year-on-year in 2012, according to the official Xinhua news agency. Overseas revenue now accounts for around 5 percent of UnionPay's total, according to a Hong Kong fund manager briefed by UnionPay executives.UnionPay, which is not a public company, does not disclose financial results or details.The United States, home to UnionPay's biggest rivals, has complained long and often about its privileged status in China. In 2012, following complaints by Washington, the World Trade Organization ordered China to stop discriminating against foreign bank card rivals such as Visa and Mastercard, but did not make any specific recommendations.""A more efficient payment card system in China would be more beneficial for both merchants and consumers,"" U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk said at the time.China has yet to open the bank card market. UnionPay regularly waives fees that its rivals charge and is known for having the lowest fees in the market overseas, said the head of bank card operations at a Hong Kong-based bank who deals regularly with UnionPay.""It seems they're at an expansion phase, so anything goes,"" said the executive. ""They don't mind losing money to gain market share. Visa and Mastercard don't offer anything like that.""""When we asked (UnionPay), 'Are your international operations making a loss?' We were told: We don't look at those numbers,"" he added.UnionPay said in a written response to questions about this assertion that its overseas operations were profitable. ""UnionPay's international business growth momentum remains good, and at the moment, it remains in a profitable state,"" the company said.Third-party installers such as EasyLink have helped  UnionPay's expansion by installing its terminals in overseas retail stores.

The company produces and sells local beers in both Ukraine and Russia.""Until now it has been business as usual. We produce, sell and distribute our products to the market without problems,"" said CEO Jorgen Buhl Rasmussen. ""Our focus is on our employees and our breweries.""Lemken, a German manufacturer of ploughs and other farm machinery, has seen a big drop-off in orders from Russia, its second-biggest export market after France, in recent weeks as a sliding rouble raises their sale price.With Moscow vowing to retaliate against the West's sanctions, Anthony van der Ley, managing director of the family-run business, is taking no chances. He is sending machinery to Russia now in case the border closes or import charges are hiked.Profine, a plastic windowframe manufacturer with annual revenues of 700 million euros ($965 million), has so far managed to compensate for the rouble slide by increasing sales but won't be able to do that forever.""If there are further sanctions, that would be poison for the economic development of our partners,"" said Peter Mrosik, the German firm's managing partner. In Canada, Bombardier Inc said the airplane maker's planned joint-venture with Rostec, the Russian state-owned industrial and defense conglomerate, was likely to be delayed because of sanctions being considered by Canada and other Western countries. A related deal for Bombardier to sell 100 short-haul Q400 NextGen aircraft was also likely to be held up.Obama unveiled sanctions against members of Putin's inner circle on Thursday as well as against Bank Rossiya, partly owned by a Putin ally.In response, Visa and MasterCard, both based in the United States, stopped providing services for clients at Rossiya and another bank SMP, whose co-owners, two brothers, are also on Obama's list.Western Union Co, the world's largest money transfer company, said it had suspended services through Bank Rossiya branches but was continuing services at more than 20,000 locations and self-service terminals in Russia.SMP described the move by Visa and MasterCard as unlawful.  However, financial services firms are wary of doing business with any person or group that can be linked back to the targets. Banks have paid dearly in the past for violating U.S. sanctions on countries such as Iran.COSMETIC SO FAR What bankers and business people fear is an escalation of measures that would choke off international payments and trade, halt investments and stymie deals. Germany's main trade body warned on Friday that full-blown economic sanctions would be a ""real catastrophe"". In a worst-case scenario, Washington would stop banks doing business with Russian counterparts and corporates, similar to the sort of sanctions that were imposed on Iran.Germany's ""wise men"" council of economic advisers said this week that the Ukraine crisis was the biggest threat to growth globally, and especially in Germany, because of Russia's importance as an energy exporter.""What has been announced so far is really nothing. It's purely cosmetic,"" said a French banker based in Moscow.""The biggest risk is tougher sanctions and really the potential impossibility of transfers in U.S. dollars,"" said the banker, who declined to be named because of official sensitivity around the restrictions.******************************************************** Bank exposure to Russia link.reuters.com/xej67v Russia's main trade partners link.reuters.com/jup77vRussia's EU trade ties link.reuters.com/rup77v******************************************************** State-owned Russian banks and companies are expected to repatriate funds from overseas after Putin told them this week to bring their assets home. But foreign bankers in Russia said things would have to deteriorate further before they would reconsider their investments there.""It would have to be a lot worse than this. We are waiting for the response from the Russian side,"" said a Western banker in Moscow. ""I haven't heard of any Western companies pulling out of Russia,"" the banker added.WAIT AND SEE Even before the Crimean crisis blew up last month, international banks such as HSBC, Credit Suisse  and Barclays had pulled out of dozens of markets because the risk of falling foul of financial crime rules and sanctions outweighed the returns.The cost to banks of cleaning up an array of misdeeds that have come to light since the global financial crisis, including sanctions busting, has soared to over $100 billion.Since the U.S. and European sanctions so far focused on wealthy individuals close to Putin, private banks which cater to powerful Russians are under the spotlight.Switzerland, the global hub for private banking and a bolt-hole for wealthy Russians, has yet to impose any restrictions but its banks, such as UBS and Credit Suisse, still have to be aware of sanctions when they deal with clients.Vasili Brokvo, the head of communications for Russia's state defence conglomerate Rostec, made the corporate case for peace.""We hope and our international partners also hope that political differences over certain issues won't annul or destroy everything we've built and all previous agreements with foreign partners will be successfully implemented,"" he said on a business trip to Chile this week.

Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said Russia might cancel its foreign borrowing for 2014 and raise less domestically if the cost of issuing debt rose.European Union leaders - who like Obama insist Crimea is still part of Ukraine - imposed their own sanctions on 12 people, including Russian deputy prime minister Dmitry Rogozin and two aides to Putin. Canada sanctioned 14 people.Shaken by the worst East-West crisis since the Cold War, the EU also pledged to cut its reliance on Russian energy and signed a political deal with the pro-Western Ukrainians who took power after Moscow-backed President Viktor Yanukovich's overthrow last month.In a Kremlin ceremony shown live on state television, Putin signed a law on ratification of a treaty making Crimea part of Russia and another creating two new Russian administrative districts: Crimea and the port city of Sevastopol, where Moscow keeps part of its Black Sea fleet.Thousands of Russians marked the annexation with fireworks and celebrations in Simferopol, capital of Crimea where the  population is around 58 percent ethnic Russian.""Many people wanted this, to go back, not to the USSR, but to that big country of ours,"" said Anna Zevetseva, 32. ""We are waiting for things to improve and for investment from Russia."" Ukrainian and Tatar residents stayed behind closed doors. Sergey, a 64-year-old Ukrainian businessman who did not want to give his surname, saw no reason to celebrate. ""An occupying force is in my country and we have been annexed,"" he said.INNER CIRCLE A referendum last Sunday after Russian troops seized control of Crimea overwhelmingly backed union with Russia but was denounced by Washington and the European Union as a sham. It opened the way for annexation within a week.The OSCE European rights and security body finally agreed to send monitors to Ukraine after a delay Western members blamed on Russia, but Moscow said it would have no mandate in Crimea.Obama's decision to target people who accompanied Putin's rise from the mayor's office in St Petersburg in the 1990s to the Russian presidency deepened the diplomatic confrontation.Putin said Bank Rossiya, singled out by Washington as the personal bank for senior Russian officials, had nothing to do with events in Crimea.The St Petersburg-based bank - which is chaired and partly owned by Yuri Kovalchuk, an old associate of Putin's - mainly serves clients in Russia's energy sector including businesses owned by state-run gas producer Gazprom.Putin, who says Crimea has exercised its right to self-determination, promised to transfer his wages to Bank Rossiya. ""I personally don't have an account there, but I certainly will open one on Monday,"" he told Russia's Security Council. Others on the U.S. blacklist include oil and commodities trader Gennady Timchenko and the brothers Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, who are linked to big contracts on gas pipelines and the Sochi Olympics, as well as Putin's chief of staff and his deputy, the head of military intelligence and a railways chief.ENERGY UNION European leaders also agreed to accelerate their quest for more secure energy supplies at talks on Friday.The EU has made progress in diversifying since crises in 2006 and 2009, when rows over unpaid bills between Kiev and Moscow led to the disruption of gas exports to western Europe.  But Russia still provides around a third of the EU's oil and gas and 40 percent of the gas goes through Ukraine.European Council President Herman Van Rompuy said member states would help one another to maintain supplies if Moscow cut them. ""We are serious about reducing our energy dependency,"" he told a news conference at the end of a summit in Brussels.EU countries, which buy Russian gas individually, will also look to negotiate supply deals jointly with Moscow to increase their bargaining power. ""It is clear we need to be moving towards an energy union,"" said Van Rompuy.German Chancellor Angela Merkel raised the possibility that U.S. shale gas could eventually be an option for European countries seeking to diversify. Obama is expected to address the issue at a summit with EU leaders next Wednesday. Foreign banks and companies now fear the secondary ripple effects of the sanctions. In a worst-case scenario for them, Washington would stop banks doing business with Russian clients, similar to the sanctions that were imposed on Iran.""What has been announced so far is really nothing. It's purely cosmetic,"" said a French banker based in Moscow, adding that the biggest risk was to transfers in U.S. dollars, crucial for the energy export-dependent Russian economy.Obama said on Thursday that Washington was also considering sanctions against economic sectors including financial services, oil and gas, metals and mining and the defence industry, if Russia made military moves into eastern and southern Ukraine.In Crimea itself, Ukrainian troops who have been surrounded by Russian forces continued to leave their bases, powerless to halt Moscow's takeover of the peninsula.""The situation in Ukraine remains unstable and menacing,"" said German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, urging the OSCE observers to take up their work as quickly as possible.EU SUPPORT FOR KIEV European governments also took individual action against Russia. Germany suspended approval of all defence-related exports to Russia, ordering contractor Rheinmetall to halt delivery of combat simulation gear, while France called off military cooperation with Moscow.In Brussels, the 28 EU leaders underlined their support for Ukraine's new leadership, signing a political agreement with interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatseniuk.They also promised financial aid for the government - rejected as illegitimate by Moscow - as soon as Kiev reaches a deal with the International Monetary Fund.The IMF is to report next Tuesday on advanced talks with Ukraine on a loan programme that would be linked to far-reaching reforms of the shattered economy.Three months of protests were set off by Yanukovich's refusal to sign an association agreement with the EU, the political part of which was signed on Friday.Russia's MICEX stock index fell about 3 percent when trade opened, although it recovered some of the losses later. Promsvyazbank analyst Oleg Shagov said Obama had ""opened a Pandora's box full of sanctions"", with future sanctions to be ""directed against whole sectors of the Russian economy"".Negative market sentiment was reinforced by warnings from credit ratings agencies Fitch and S&P that they were changing their outlooks on Russia to negative from stable because of the possible impact of sanctions on Russia's economy and business climate. Both agencies presently rate Russia BBB.Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev made clear that Russia would step up financial pressure on Ukraine. He said the former Soviet republic should repay Moscow $11 billion under a gas supply contract that should be scrapped because it no longer applied.(Additional reporting by Alexandar Vasovic in Simferopol, Luke Baker, Justyna Pawlak, Jan Strupczewski, Barbara Lewis, Robin Emmott and Martin Santa in Brussels, Oksana Kobzeva, Lidia Kelly, Elizabeth Piper, Jason Bush, Megan Davies and Alexei Anishchuk in Moscow; Lionel Laurent in Paris; Writing by David Stamp; Editing by Will Waterman, Paul Taylor and Philippa Fletcher)",2014-03-21,V,"Fri Mar 21, 2014 | 5:22pm EDT","WRAPUP 6-Putin completes Crimea's annexation, Russia investors take fright",http://www.reuters.com//article/ukraine-crisis-idUSL6N0MI1V020140321?type=companyNews
20,"   By Lionel Laurent and Megan Davies | PARIS/MOSCOW, March 21  PARIS/MOSCOW, March 21 U.S. and European sanctions against Russia are already having a ripple effect beyond their immediate targets, with Visa and MasterCard  halting payment transaction services for clients of a bank not even on the blacklist.SMP bank's co-owners are two of the 20 Russians targeted by U.S. President Barack Obama as he tries to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin for annexing Crimea.The lender described the move by Visa and MasterCard as unlawful. However, financial services firms are wary of doing business with any person or group that can be linked back to Obama's blacklist.Banks have paid dearly in the past for violating U.S. sanctions on countries such as Iran, and the threat of broader measures against the Russian economy should Putin threaten southern and eastern Ukraine reinforces their caution.The U.S. sanctions forced Russian billionaire Gennady Timchenko to sell his nearly 50 percent stake in Gunvor, the world's fourth-largest oil trader, this week but their direct effect has generally been relatively minor so far.What bankers and business people fear is an escalation of measures that would choke off international payments and trade, halt investments and stymie deals. Germany's main trade body warned on Friday that full-blown economic sanctions would be a ""real catastrophe"".In a worst-case scenario, Washington would stop banks doing business with Russian counterparts and corporates, similar to the sort of sanctions that were imposed on Iran.Germany's ""wise men"" council of economic advisers said this week that the Ukraine crisis was the biggest threat to growth globally, and especially in Germany, because of Russia's importance of an energy exporter.""What has been announced so far is really nothing. It's purely cosmetic,"" said a French banker based in Moscow.""The biggest risk is tougher sanctions and really the potential impossibility of transfers in U.S. dollars. That will hit trade finance, which depends on correspondent accounts in dollars,"" said the banker, who declined to be named because of official sensitivity around the restrictions. ""Being able to make payments in dollars is crucial for the Russian economy, which is dependent on energy exports. It would really hurt us domestically.""******************************************************** Bank exposure to Russia link.reuters.com/xej67vRussia's main trade partners link.reuters.com/jup77vRussia's EU trade ties link.reuters.com/rup77v ******************************************************** State-owned Russian banks and companies are expected to repatriate funds from overseas after Putin told them this week to bring their assets home. But foreign bankers in Russia said things would have to deteriorate further before they would reconsider their investments there.""It would have to be a lot worse than this. We are waiting for the response from the Russian side. It's very difficult to predict,"" said another Western banker in Moscow. ""I haven't heard of any Western companies pulling out of Russia. If a company is substantially invested here it will be difficult for them to consider getting out.""WAIT AND SEE  Even before the Crimean crisis blew up last month, international banks such as HSBC, Credit Suisse  and Barclays had pulled out of dozens of markets because the risk of falling foul of financial crime rules and sanctions outweighed the returns.The cost to banks of cleaning up an array of misdeeds that have come to light since the global financial crisis, including sanctions busting, has soared to over $100 billion.With that figure expected to climb, Western banks have so far steered clear of attempts by Iran to get them involved in financing humanitarian transactions, despite a diplomatic thaw.With the U.S. and European sanctions so far focused on wealthy individuals close to Putin, private banks which cater to powerful Russians are under the spotlight.Switzerland, the centre of international private banking and a bolt-hole for wealthy Russians, has yet to impose any sanctions but its banks, such as UBS and Credit Suisse, still have to be aware of sanctions when they deal with clients.Beyond banking, big companies such as AstraZeneca  have said they are monitoring the situation in Russia, while doubts are growing over whether smaller firms with less financial flexibility should push ahead with investments in Russia such as building factories.""They are in a wait-and-see mode. But again the timing could be waiting three to six months rather than scrapping the whole thing,"" said a second French banker working in Moscow.Vasili Brokvo, the head of communications for Russia's state defence conglomerate Rostec, made the corporate case for peace.""We hope and our international partners also hope that political differences over certain issues won't annul or destroy everything we've built and all previous agreements with foreign partners will be successfully implemented,"" he said on a business trip to Chile this week.

25,"  (Adds Schaeuble quote, G7 to meet on Monday)* NATO commander warns of threat to Transdniestria* Says Russian force on Ukraine border is ""very, very sizeable and very, very ready""* Russian ambassador to EU says Russia has no expansionist views* U.S. Senator John McCain draws parallel between Putin and Hitler* Russian bank SMP says Visa, MasterCard resume processing paymentsBy Adrian Croft and Aleksandar VasovicBRUSSELS/FEODOSIA, Ukraine, March 23 NATO's top military commander said on Sunday Russia had built up a ""very sizeable"" force on its border with Ukraine and Moscow may have a region in another ex-Soviet republic, Moldova, in its sights after annexing Crimea.Russia was acting more like an adversary than a partner, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe, U.S. Air Force General Philip Breedlove said, and the 28-nation alliance should rethink the positioning and readiness of its forces in eastern Europe.Russian troops, using armoured vehicles, automatic weapons and stun grenades, seized some of the last military facilities under Ukrainian control on Saturday in Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula that Russian President Vladimir Putin formally annexed the day before.Breedlove was one of several Western officials and politicians to warn on Sunday that Russia may not stop there in a crisis that has taken East-West relations lurching back towards the Cold War since pro-Western protests in Ukraine ousted Moscow-allied President Viktor Yanukovich last month.""The (Russian) force that is at the Ukrainian border now to the east is very, very sizeable and very, very ready,"" the NATO commander told an event held by the German Marshall Fund think-tank.U.S. President Barack Obama's deputy national security adviser Tony Blinken said the build-up might just be aimed at intimidating Ukraine's new pro-Western leaders but that Russia could invade the country's mainly Russian-speaking east. ""It's possible that they are preparing to move in,"" he told CNN.A meeting of the G7 group of industrialised nations has been hastily convened for Monday in the Netherlands to allow leaders to discuss a response to Russia's actions. Obama will also meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov for bilateral talks.Russia said it was complying with international agreements and had no plans to invade. It has called the soldiers who took over Ukrainian bases in Crimea ""self defence forces"". The United States and the European Union have targeted some of Putin's closest political and business allies with personal sanctions and have threatened broader economic sanctions if Putin's forces encroach on other eastern or southern parts of Ukraine with big Russian-speaking populations.Germany, which has close trade ties with Russia, said the European Union was united in its readiness to impose sanctions on Russia if necessary, and that Moscow had the most to lose.""None of us wants to escalate, but if Russia changes things unilaterally, then it must know that we won't accept it and that relations will be bad,"" Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told German television.""VERY WORRISOME"" Ukrainian marine standards were still flying on Sunday alongside the Russian flag at the Crimean base of Ukraine's top military unit in Feodosia, but the Ukrainian troops were getting ready to leave after the Russian military takeover.""Our only issue is that we want to leave this place with honour, weapons and vehicles,"" one Ukrainian soldier said. Blinken said Washington was considering all requests for military assistance from the government in Kiev, but that it would be unlikely to prevent an invasion of Ukraine, which is not part of NATO. Breedlove said the military alliance needed to think about its eastern members, particularly the former Soviet Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.""We need to think about our allies, the positioning of our forces in the alliance and the readiness of those forces ... such that we can be there to defend against it if required, especially in the Baltics and other places,"" Breedlove said.Breedlove said NATO was very concerned about the threat to Transdniestria, which declared independence from Moldova in 1990 but has not been recognised by any United Nations member state. About 30 percent of its half million population is ethnic Russian and more than half of the total speak Russian as a mother tongue.Russia has 440 peacekeepers in Transdniestria plus other soldiers guarding Soviet-era arms stocks. It launched a new military exercise, involving 8,500 artillery men, near Ukraine's eastern border 10 days ago.""There is absolutely sufficient (Russian) force postured on the eastern border of Ukraine to run to Transdniestria if the decision was made to do that, and that is very worrisome,"" Breedlove said.The speaker of Transdniestria's parliament has urged Russia to incorporate the region, which lies to the west of Ukraine. The new leaders in Kiev have said Moscow could seek to link up pro-Russian regions in Moldova, and Georgia to Ukraine's east, in a destabilising southern corridor with Crimea in the middle.Russia's Deputy Defence Minister Anatoly Antonov was quoted by the state's Itar-Tass news agency as saying Russia was complying with international agreements limiting the number of troops near its border with Ukraine. Moscow's ambassador to the European Union, Vladimir Chizhov,  said Russia did not have ""expansionist views"". Asked to give a commitment that Russian troops would not move into Ukrainian territory outside Crimea, he told Britain's BBC. ""There is no intention of the Russian Federation to do anything like that.""U.S. Senator John McCain, a Republican foreign policy specialist, told the same BBC show that Putin's actions in Ukraine were akin to those of Adolf Hitler in 1930s Germany.""I think he (Putin) is calculating how much he can get away with, just as Adolf Hitler calculated how much he could get away with in the 1930s,"" McCain said.""PANDORA'S BOX"" Germany's Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier underscored the huge potential repercussions of Russia's bid to redraw national borders in Europe.""I'm very worried the unlawful attempt to alter recognised borders in our European neighbourhood, 25 years after the end of the Cold War, will open Pandora's Box,"" he said.Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko, a close ally of Russia, accepted on Sunday that Crimea was now ""de facto"" a part of Russia, but said the annexation set a ""bad precedent"".Western sanctions lost some of their sting on Sunday when Russia's SMP bank, whose main shareholders were targeted by U.S. sanctions, said Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc had resumed payment services for its clients.The bank said it was glad the two biggest international payments systems had listened to its arguments to reverse Friday's suspension of services as it was wrong to target the bank, which was not itself subject to any sanctions.Putin and Russian media had mocked the sanctions, which did not stop the Russian military completing its takeover of Ukraine's military bases in Crimea. Russia's defence ministry said on Sunday that its flag was now flying over 189 Ukrainian military installations on the peninsula.The EU emphasised its support for the new pro-Western government in Kiev, signing a political agreement with interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatseniuk last week.It also promised financial aid for the government - which Moscow says came to power by a coup to overthrow Yanukovich after he rejected an EU trade deal in favour of closer ties with Russia - as soon as Kiev reaches a deal with the International Monetary Fund. The IMF will report on Tuesday.

Visa, which has some 100 million cards in Russia, said in April U.S. sanctions were hurting its transaction volumes.""It's not in anyone's interest for either Visa or Mastercard to leave,"" Kuzmin said. ""For the companies, Russia is a fast-growing market, and for the authorities over 90 percent of Russian cards now use Visa and Mastercard systems.""

52,"   By Richard Lough | ADDIS ABABA  ADDIS ABABA May 26 Visa Inc., which is piloting Ethiopia's first international debit card, is seeking to persuade the government to ease tight restrictions on banks in an effort to boost the use of electronic payments.Ethiopia has one of Africa's fastest-growing economies but few people in the Horn of Africa nation of 90 million have bank accounts and the range of services is limited.The government bars foreign banks, saying it needs to protect domestic lenders, and local debit cards have until now not worked abroad.Jabu Basopo, Visa's manager for southern and east Africa, said the focus was on persuading leaders of the $43 billion economy that is dominated by state enterprise about the benefits of electronic payments. ""They are willing to try some things,"" said Basopo. ""They have agreed to a pilot for international cards. It is a very controlled environment.""Users of Visa's international card, which is being trialled by government officials, will be restricted to spending an amount that has been pre-loaded on the card. Visa said the government was pleased with the trial so far.Basopo said local banks lacked muscle to push the central bank to drive change in an industry where the largest commercial lender is run by the state and holds two-thirds of all deposits. He pointed to Rwanda as an example of where business-friendly reforms to liberalise banking regulations in the past four years had led to a swift deepening of the market.""Rwanda was in a similar situation. (Now) every bank is listed to Visa. All the ATMs in the country are linked to Visa ... and we've seen a lot of growth in terms of retailers actually accepting Visa cards now,"" Basopo said. Retail transactions in Ethiopia are primarily made in cash. Retailers say a scarcity of debit cards hinders growth in the retail sector, which is also off-limits to foreign chains.""If you look at the main efficiencies brought by electronic payments ... more money stays in the banks and the banks are able to lend that money back to retailers to do more business,"" Basopo said.Visa, the world's largest credit and debit card company which counts 10 Ethiopian banks as members, first entered the country in 2004.The International Monetary Fund has warned that Ethiopia's huge public spending on roads, railways and power is suffocating private lending. It says Ethiopia should row back on public spending to allow the private sector greater access to credit.

63,"   By Andrew Longstreth  NEW YORK, July 18 - A federal judge declined on Friday to dismiss antitrust lawsuits filed against Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc by retailers who opted out of an estimated $5.7 billion class action settlement in 2012 over transaction fees.Retailers such as Target Corp and Amazon.com Inc  have accused Visa and MasterCard of fixing the fees charged to merchants each time their customers used credit or debit cards. They also alleged the two companies prevented merchants from steering customers to cheaper forms of payment.U.S. District Judge John Gleeson of Brooklyn said on Friday the lawsuits could proceed, according to Jeffrey Shinder, an attorney for some of the retailers.Shinder declined further comment. In December, Gleeson approved an estimated $5.7 billion settlement between the two credit card companies and a nationwide class of merchants over similar allegations.But thousands of retailers, including some of the biggest in the United States such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc, opted out of the settlement, complaining it was not adequate. Those companies argued the settlement offered meaningless reforms that would not help them control the costs of accepting credit cards. Many of those retailers who objected to the settlement filed their own lawsuits.A spokesman for MasterCard said in a statement that Gleeson's ruling on Friday was at earliest stage of the case. ""We look forward to putting this matter behind us and continuing to work productively with the merchant community,"" he said.A Visa spokesman had no immediate comment.The case is Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation - Opt Out Cases, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, No. 14-01720.

Stronger-than-expected U.S. durable goods data also helped the dollar.     U.S. stocks were lower in early trading, hurt by results from Amazon.com and Visa, the two biggest drags on the S&P 500. Amazon dropped 11.1 percent to $318.79, while Visa was down 4.9 percent at $211.90.     ""Earnings have been the driving force of this market all week. We had a series of good reports but Amazon in particular was a disappointment and has led to some profit-taking,"" said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.     Signs emerged that tensions between the West and Russia are starting to hurt confidence in Europe's dominant economy. Germany's Ifo survey revealed a hefty fall in business confidence over the last few weeks, prompting concerns the region's growth engine and driver of its recovery could be stuttering.      It was the third consecutive fall in an index which monitors the mood of thousands of German firms.      MSCI's All-World Index was down 0.5 percent and European stocks down 0.8 percent.     The Dow Jones industrial average fell 154.06 points or 0.9 percent, to 16,929.74, the S&P 500 lost 12.36 points or 0.62 percent, to 1,975.62 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 38.35 points or 0.86 percent, to 4,433.76.     The euro hit an eight-month low against the dollar of $1.3427 after U.S. durable goods orders data, which followed more positive U.S. jobless data Thursday.      The euro also fell on ongoing tensions between Russia and Ukraine. European officials are to continue talks over plans to squeeze Russia with further sanctions following the downing of a Malaysia Airlines that killed almost 300 people.      Dollar-traded Russian stocks fell 1.6 percent to bring losses over two weeks to roughly 12 percent. Russian bonds also fell as the country's central bank unexpectedly raised interest rates.      U.S. Treasuries prices jumped, with fixed-income traders disappointed by soft spots in the U.S. durable goods report. Ten-year Treasuries were up 8/32 in price to yield 2.478 percent.      Despite the heftier-than-forecast 0.7 percent overall rise in orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured items in June, some focused on weakness in airlines and other sectors that shook optimism about U.S. economic growth.     Gold edged up after dropping to a one-month low overnight, but was headed for a second straight week of losses.      U.S. crude was near flat at $102.07 a barrel, while Brent was up 65 cents at $107.72.

Most were debit cards.RuPay's share of daily card transactions, however, remains small compared with the global firms, which are more established, offer both debit and credit cards and are accepted by more retailers. RuPay currently offers only debit cards.RuPay users account for just 1.5 percent of daily card transactions of almost one million at retailers, said A.P. Hota, chief executive of the National Payments Corp of India (NPCI), which runs RuPay.Hota told Reuters the payments network was set to grow rapidly from the government's so-called financial inclusion scheme, which aims to ensure the majority of households has a bank account within months. Under the scheme launched late in August, Indians who open a bank account for the first time automatically get a RuPay card.Hota said the number of RuPay users has now almost doubled from 23 million at the end of July.By March next year, he expects that number to rise to 160 million, with more than 60 percent of the increase coming from the government scheme. ""Jan Dhan itself would provide a big opportunity for the domestic card brand to be a formidable force,"" said Hota, referring to the financial inclusion scheme, Jan Dhan Yojana, which means People's Wealth Scheme.""(RuPay Card transactions are) just a drop in the ocean at the moment.

91,"   By David Randall | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Oct 3 Portfolio manager Bill Nygren, whose $6.2 billion Oakmark Select fund has been among the best performing large cap funds in 2014, has added more than a million shares of MasterCard Inc this year, even as shares of the payments company have shed almost 12 percent year to date.Now the fourth-largest position in Nygren's fund, Mastercard has lost value on investor concerns about international sanctions on Russia and developments in alternative payments, such as Apple's introduction of its own payments system and eBay's decision to spin off its PayPal division into a separate company.Nygren, whose 10.3 percent gain for the year puts his fund in the top 1 percent of 1,586 large cap funds tracked by Morningstar, sees phone-based payments as accelerating the demise of cash. That should be especially helpful to MasterCard, the second-largest payments company globally, in emerging market countries where smartphones are more plentiful than bank accounts, he said.""If I pay with a smartphone instead of a credit card, that doesn't mean that MasterCard is going to be missing out on its fraction of a percentage of the sale.""While he owns shares of Visa Inc in another fund he managers, Nygren has been buying MasterCard for the Oakmark Select fund, because it has more to gain from growth overseas and should perform better over the next three to five years, he said. Visa, by comparison, is more U.S.-focused, he said.Visa gets more than 50 percent of its revenue domestically, compared with 40 percent for MasterCard, according to Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. The drop in MasterCard shares, which trails the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 by about 17 percentage points year to date, makes the company a bargain even though it trades at 26.5  times trailing earnings, Nygren said. He expects the company to increase earnings by approximately 20 percent a year for the next several years as it continues to grow overseas, compared with single digit growth for the S&P 500.Visa, by comparison, is down 5 percent for the year and trades at a cheaper 23 times trailing earnings.Nygren is not put off by the fact that MasterCard is more expensive by those measures, even as it underperforms its competitors. ""Buying excellent companies at average prices is just as much value investing as buying average companies at exceptional prices,"" Nygren said.ANALYST VIEWS  Analysts are largely bullish on the company, with an average target price among analysts tracked by Reuters of $89.02, a figure 22 percent higher than its closing price of $73.42 on Thursday. Twenty-eight out of 35 analysts tracked by Reuters have an overweight or buy rating, with just one, Christopher Donat at Sandler O'Neill Partners, having a sell rating.Concerns that the company's growth will slow after years of strong performance is one of the main reasons behind its falling stock price this year, said Wedbush's Luria, who has a ""hold"" rating on the shares and a target price of $80. He recently reduced his 2014 earnings per share estimate for the company to $3.04 from $3.14.""The upside is less than it used to be,"" he said, adding that Chase bank's decision early this year to shift customers from MasterCard-branded debit and credit cards to Visa cards will continue to cut into growth.Mastercard did not comment for this story.Nygren is not put off by MasterCard's continued declines since he began buying. Shares are down 2.2 percent over the last week alone.""MasterCard has not helped our performance this year, but there is nothing fundamentally going on at the company that we are concerned about,"" he said.

92,"  (Adds details, shares)Oct 15 American Express Co, the world's largest credit card issuer, reported an 8.1 percent rise in quarterly profit due to higher spending by U.S. customers using its credit cards and a rise in its net interest income.Spending by U.S. holders of AmEx cards rose 9 percent in the third quarter, boosting profit in the business by 14 percent.The business accounted for nearly three-quarters of the company's profit.U.S. consumer spending rose 0.5 percent in August after being unchanged in July, the Commerce Department said last month. AmEx, which issues its own cards unlike Visa Inc and Mastercard Inc that work through banks, benefits from its largely affluent customer base and low rates of default.However, single-digit growth in spending by its card users for about two years has pushed the company to launch products such as a fee-free card that targets a wider range of customers. The company's net income rose to $1.48 billion, or $1.40 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from $1.37 billion, or $1.25 per share, a year earlier.Net interest income rose 8.7 percent to $1.4 billion. However, total revenue, net of interest expense, remained nearly unchanged at $8.33 billion.Chief Executive Kenneth Chenault said AmEx's revenue was growing at a pace below the company's long-term target. ""While the economy is stronger, it is not growing as fast or as steadily as most people would like,"" he said in a statement.Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.36 per share and revenue of $8.35 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.AmEx's shares closed at $80.93 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.

93,"   By Deepa Seetharaman | LAGUNA BEACH, Calif.  LAGUNA BEACH, Calif. Oct 27 Apple Inc  CEO Tim Cook fired back at CVS and Rite Aid on Monday after the drugstore chains blocked the iPhone maker's mobile payments service, saying there were plenty of other retailers around the world to sign up.Apple Pay launched about a week ago and saw more than a million credit cards registered over the first 72 hours. It already totes up more transactions than all other ""contactless"" payment methods combined, Cook said, citing Visa and Mastercard data.Such services, through which a user pays by holding a smartphone close to a specially designed terminal, have failed to catch on in the United States despite the backing of Google Inc and other influential players.News emerged over the weekend that the two retailers had opted out of Apple Pay in favor of a rival system that roughly 50 chains, including Wal-Mart and Best Buy, are developing for in-house use. ""We've got a lot more merchants to sign up, we've got a lot of banks to sign up and we've got the rest of the world,"" Cook told the Wall Street Journal Digital Live conference, in the company's most extensive comments on the blockade so far.In launching Apple Pay, the iPhone maker hopes to lock in more customers for its mobile devices by enhancing their overall utility. Industry experts say it stands a chance of becoming the first widely used payments feature on smartphones.CVS and Rite Aid have not explained their surprise move.     But the driving force behind developing a retailer-owned mobile payment solution is to avoid paying credit card transaction fees to card companies like Visa and Mastercard, analysts said. Fees range between 2 percent and 3 percent of costs per transaction. Rite Aid stopped accepting Apple Pay last week at its 4,572 stores. Spokeswoman Ashley Flower said the company was evaluating various forms of mobile payment technologies.CVS did not respond to queries seeking comment but a visit to two of its stores showed that the NFC (Near Field Communications) reader on which Apple Pay was used had been deactivated. It remains to be seen, despite early signs of success, whether mobile payments will become widely adopted.Cook argued on Monday that Apple Pay offered better security and privacy than competing services, and that retailers risked alienating customers by limiting choices at checkout.""It's a skirmish,"" Cook said in response to a question about the retailers' moves.""Merchants have different objectives sometimes. But in the long arc of time, you only are relevant as a retailer or merchant if your customers love you.""

Foreign firms that meet its criteria could set up their own clearing companies, it added, but gave no further details. It was not immediately clear if the move would allow foreign firms to process credit and debit card payments made in yuan in China.Visa, the world's largest credit and debit card company, welcomed the move.""We look forward to seeing the specific details and working with people within China to figure out what we need to do to participate in that marketplace, where we believe we can add a lot of value,"" Chief Executive Charlie Scharf said on a conference call, following the release of its fourth-quarter earnings. In July 2012, the world trade body held that China had discriminated against U.S. bank card suppliers in its electronic payments market by favouring state behemoth China UnionPay, following a complaint to the WTO by the United States.The trade watchdog found that UnionPay had an illegal monopoly on yuan payment cards issued and used in China, but rejected the U.S. claim that UnionPay was an ""across-the-board monopoly supplier"" of all yuan transactions.As the world's largest card brand with 3.53 billion cards in circulation since its founding in 2002, UnionPay's rise came at a time of explosive growth in China's interbank card market. Total bank card transactions leapt 37 percent to 21.8 trillion yuan ($3.6 trillion) in China in 2012, from 2011.China requires all foreign card companies to piggyback on UnionPay's network when accepting yuan payments.This means firms such as Visa and Mastercard must give a cut of every credit or debit card transaction to UnionPay and the card issuing bank. In most other countries, the foreign card issuers pay only the bank because they use their own network.Wednesday's promise to free a business sector is the latest step taken by China this year to free up the world's second-largest economy, albeit in vague terms.The Chinese cabinet last month also said it was freeing up the domestic courier market, potentially opening the way to competition by firms such as FedEx Corp and United Parcel Services.But that announcement, like Wednesday's, also gave no details, and it was unclear which curbs would be eased.

108,"  * Dollar, yields jump after Fed ends QE* Global equity markets mixed* Fed statement more hawkish than markets had expected   (Recasts lead, adds U.S. open, adds Visa, changes dateline, previously LONDON)By Yasmeen AbutalebNEW YORK, Oct 30 Global equity markets were mixed on Thursday while the dollar surged to a three-week high and government bond yields rose, one day after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced the end of its six-year bond-buying stimulus program.The Fed, as expected, said it would no longer add to its holdings of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, effectively ending a program that at its peak pumped $85 billion a month into the financial system to hold interest rates down and boost the flagging economy. Less expected was the Fed's expression of confidence in the U.S. recovery, despite global growth concerns, which prompted financial markets to rethink the growing consensus that the Fed's first interest rate hike would be late in 2015.The Fed did note in its statement Wednesday after a two-day meeting that overnight borrowing costs would remain near zero for a ""considerable time.""""The tone in the statement was relatively more hawkish than had been anticipated,"" said Mohannad Aama, managing director of Beam Capital Management LLC in New York. ""The FX markets have concluded an interest rate hike is going to happen probably sooner rather than later."" The dollar jumped 0.3 percent against a basket of six major currencies and rose 0.2 percent against the euro to $1.2602. The two-year U.S. bond yield on Wednesday posted its biggest one-day rise in almost four years.MSCI's index of equities in 45 countries fell 0.4 percent.

Oil also fell, with U.S. and Brent crude futures down more than 1 percent to $81.02 and $86.20 a barrel, respectively.Brazil surprised markets late on Wednesday by hiking interest rates, a bold move that signals President Dilma Rousseff may make market-friendly policy changes after her narrow re-election victory on Sunday.The rate hike could give the Brazilian real a further lift.

109,"  * Visa, MasterCard both rally after results* Third-quarter GDP tops expectations* Energy shares fall alongside drop in crude prices* Dow up 0.6 pct, S&P 500 flat, Nasdaq down 0.1 pctBy Ryan VlastelicaNEW YORK, Oct 30 U.S. stocks were mostly flat on Thursday, as a strong read on third-quarter economic growth raised new questions about monetary policy, though strong results at Visa single-handedly put the Dow in positive territory.Gross domestic product grew at a 3.5 percent annual rate in the third quarter, beating expectations, though down from the 4.6 percent rate in the second quarter. The data came a day after the Federal Reserve ended its stimulative bond-buying program. Without quantitative easing - which fueled market gains over recent years, though its end was widely expected - investors are looking to when the central bank will begin raising interest rates. The Fed has said its first rate hike would be dependent on the strength of economic data.""A strong report, on the heels of a more hawkish tone from the Fed yesterday, has some investors thinking we could see a rake hike faster than might otherwise have been hoped,"" said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland. ""That's dampening the spirits of investors who were hoping for easier monetary conditions for an extended period.""In comments released after a two-day meeting, the U.S. central bank expressed confidence in U.S. economic prospects and dropped a characterization of U.S. labor market slack as ""significant."" In a separate report on the economy, jobless claims unexpectedly rose in the latest week, but they remained at levels consistent with a firming labor market.Visa Inc jumped 8.9 percent to $233.75 as the biggest boost to both the Dow and S&P 500 a day after it reported adjusted earnings that topped expectations, and said the mobile payment industry would be ""a great driver"" for business.MasterCard Inc also posted a better-than-expected profit, while revenue was up almost 13 percent.  MasterCard added 7.5 percent to $81.69. So far this reporting season, 75.3 percent of S&P 500 companies have exceeded profit expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, above the long-term average of 63 percent.At 9:50 a.m. (1350 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average  rose 103.84 points, or 0.61 percent, to 17,078.15. Without Visa adding 122.8 points to the Dow, the blue-chip index would be in negative territory. The S&P 500 gained 0.47 points, or 0.02 percent, to 1,982.77 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 3.77 points, or 0.08 percent, to 4,545.46.Energy shares were the weakest of the day, dropping 0.9 percent alongside a 1.3 percent drop in the price of crude oil. ConocoPhillips fell 0.9 percent to $70.14 despite reporting adjusted earnings that beat expectations.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,439 to 1,262, for a 1.14-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 1,170 issues rose and 1,058 fell for a 1.11-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.The benchmark S&P 500 index was posting 15 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 41 new highs and 14 new lows.

110,"  BEIJING Visa Inc (V.N) and Mastercard Inc (MA.N) welcome China's plans to open up its market for clearing domestic bank card transactions, as they stand to gain access to a growing market worth more than $1 trillion a year.  While China lags behind countries such as the United States in spending on credit, habits are changing fast and the Chinese are increasingly swiping plastic to satisfy their growing appetite for consumer goods.The State Council, China's cabinet, said on Wednesday after a weekly meeting that foreign firms that meet its criteria could set up their own clearing companies. It did not provide details.Visa, the world's largest credit and debit card company, welcomed the move.""We look forward to seeing the specific details and working with people within China to figure out what we need to do to participate in that marketplace, where we believe we can add a lot of value,"" Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf said on a conference call, following the release of its fourth-quarter earnings.Household debt in China amounted to just 37 percent of GDP at the end of July, compared with 81 percent in the United States. But the Chinese, renowned for being thrifty, are changing fast. China's total outstanding credit card balances, while less than 10 percent of household debt, were a third higher at the end of June than a year ago, according to the People's Bank of China. The amount outstanding per card has increased by more than two-thirds in two years.Mastercard, the second-largest payments company globally, also welcomes the opportunity to expand in the world's second-largest economy.""We will continue to monitor closely and look forward to the day when we can compete for domestic business in China,"" MasterCard said in a statement emailed to Reuters on Thursday. The explosion in online retailers, fueled by increasingly well-heeled youth, is adding to the allure of plastic. Access for foreign firms to China's fast-growing electronic payments market is a controversial issue. China promised to reform and free its electronic payments market after the World Trade Organization (WTO) said in 2012 that its behavior discriminated against U.S. firms.It was not immediately clear if the move would allow foreign firms to process credit and debit card payments made in yuan in China.  In July 2012, the world trade body held that China had discriminated against U.S. bank card suppliers in its electronic payments market by favoring state behemoth China UnionPay, following a complaint to the WTO by the United States.The trade watchdog found that UnionPay had an illegal monopoly on yuan payment cards issued and used in China, but rejected the U.S. claim that UnionPay was an ""across-the-board monopoly supplier.    ""As a market-orientated business, China UnionPay will operate under the same regulations as other banks, to ensure equal market competition in a way that complies with the law,"" said UnionPay in a statement emailed to Reuters on Thursday.    As the world's largest card brand with 3.53 billion cards in circulation since its founding in 2002, UnionPay's rise came at a time of explosive growth in China's interbank card market. Total bank card transactions leapt 37 percent to 21.8 trillion yuan ($3.6 trillion) in China in 2012, from 2011. China requires all foreign card companies to piggyback on UnionPay's network when accepting yuan payments. This means firms such as Visa and Mastercard must give a cut of every credit or debit card transaction to UnionPay and the card issuing bank. In most other countries, the foreign card issuers pay only the bank because they use their own network.Wednesday's promise to free a business sector is the latest step taken by China this year to open up its financial markets. The Chinese cabinet last month also said it was freeing up the domestic courier market, potentially opening the way to competition by firms such as FedEx Corp (FDX.N) and United Parcel Services (UPS.N). But that announcement, like Wednesday's, also gave no details, and it was unclear which curbs would be eased.($1=6.1107 Chinese yuan) (Reporting by Koh Gui Qing; Additional reporting by Tanya Agrawal in Bangalore and Engen Tham in Shanghai; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)",2014-10-30,V,"Wed Oct 29, 2014 | 11:23pm EDT","Visa, Mastercard welcome Beijing's plans to free bank cards market",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-china-banks-clearing-idUSKBN0II0X920141030?type=companyNews

112,"  (Adds opposition politician, analyst comment)TORONTO Nov 4 Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc  voluntarily agreed to cut the fees they charge to Canadian retailers for credit transactions, the government said on Tuesday, adding it now sees no need to regulate fees set by credit card networks.The Canadian government said the agreement, which industry sources last week confirmed was in the works, should result in lower prices for consumers.Canadian retailers have long bemoaned the high interchange fees they pay credit card companies and banks for transactions.Unlike American Express, which typically negotiates a flat fee with every merchant, Visa and MasterCard have variable fees based on the status of their different cards. Small retailers say this hurts them as they are never sure on whether they are going to be billed 1 or 3 percent on any given transaction.Canada's Conservative government pledged earlier this year to promote lower credit card acceptance costs for merchants. And Finance Minister Joe Oliver said in September the government wanted credit card companies and banks to voluntarily agree to a deal. On Tuesday Oliver said he welcomed the decision, which will trim fees to an average effective rate of 1.5 percent for the next five years, reducing overall fees by about 10 percent.""As a result of the voluntary proposals, there is no need for the government to regulate the interchange rates,"" the government said, adding that Visa and MasterCard have agreed to start implementing the reductions no later than April.The deal was panned by Canada's main opposition party, who said the move let down consumers or small businesses and noted that Canada's Competition Tribunal had specifically called on the government to regulate the fees. ""We can't allow companies to set their own disciplinary measures,"" New Democrat parliamentarian Annick Papillon said in a statement, dubbing the government's decision a ""shameful climb-down.""BANKS MOSTLY UNSCATHED  Although the long anticipated fee reduction is likely to eat slightly into the bottom line of the Canadian banks, analysts expect a limited impact.""We believe potential changes to interchange fees represent a modest but transitory headwind to the group, with a greater impact to TD and CIBC, and the least impact to Scotia and Royal (Bank),"" Barclays analyst John Aiken wrote in a note to clients.Aiken noted there are several ways the banks can mitigate the impact of the reduction, including by increasing annual fees on cards and reducing the benefits of loyalty programs.A spokesman for Royal Bank of Canada said the bank was still assessing the impact of the changes, but was well positioned to make any adjustments required.Shares in Aimia, operator of the Aeroplan loyalty program, had been weighed down by the prospect of a lower fee structure. But the stock rose 4.6 percent on Tuesday, suggesting investors do not see the changes crimping the popular reward program offered by certain banks on some credit cards.

By contrast, online spending last month was lower than a year earlier, though the decline was less than in October.The fastest spending growth was seen in hotels, restaurants and bars, where sales are more than 10 percent higher than a year ago, while the biggest falls came at businesses such as hairdressers and jewelers.

""With Christmas just around the corner, consumer appetite remains positive, suggesting overall spending (growth) this year looks set to reach levels not seen since 2010,"" said Kevin Jenkins, a senior Visa Europe executive.Results for the high street, where spending grew at the second-fastest annual rate since July 2010, were especially impressive, with shops benefiting from Black Friday sales which kick-started trading in the Christmas period. This year several British retailers fully embraced the U.S.-born shopping frenzy for the first time, leading to surging crowds, fights and record sales for some, such as Britain's largest department store group John Lewis. By contrast, online spending last month was lower than a year earlier, though the decline was less than in October.The fastest spending growth was seen in hotels, restaurants and bars, where sales are more than 10 percent higher than a year ago, while the biggest falls came at businesses such as hairdressers and jewellers.The Visa data is based on credit and debit card transactions that account for around a third of all spending in Britain. The figures are adjusted for inflation and to be representative for all consumer spending, not just that made by card.

123,"  (Writes through, adds comment from EU Commissioner, Visa)By Jan Strupczewski and Foo Yun CheeBRUSSELS Dec 18 European Union governments have agreed to cap the fees retailers pay to process debit and credit card transactions in a move the EU parliament said should bring down costs for customers.Negotiators from European governments and the economic committee of the EU parliament agreed late on Wednesday to cap charges across the 28 countries in the union following a long battle over charges with payments groups, including Visa  and MasterCard.The cap would apply to both cross-border and domestic card-based payments which cost businesses across the EU around 10 billion euros ($12.3 billion) a year. The fees are opaque and differ from country to country.Retailers are charged for every card transaction and add the costs to the prices of the goods or services they offer.""This legislation is good for consumers, good for business, and good for Europe. It will lead to lower prices and visibility of costs for consumers,"" said Margrethe Vestager, commissioner in charge of competition policy.She said the interchange fee was a ""tax"" levied on business by banks and the price cap should release ""the brakes that have so far held back innovation."" VISA WARNING Visa said clarity on the fees was welcome, but warned it could hurt the cards industry and said there was no guarantee that retailers would pass on the savings to consumers.""We continue to have serious concerns that the regulation will have unintended consequences, particularly for consumers, and that it could stifle future innovation,"" Visa said in a statement. The European parliament said credit card fees will be capped at 0.3 percent of the transaction value.Cross-border debit card fees will be capped at 0.2 percent of the transaction value, and domestic debit card fees will be capped at 0.2 percent of the annual weighted average transaction value of all domestic transactions within the card scheme.Fees charged by banks belonging to card schemes such as Visa and MasterCard, so-called four-party schemes involving the bank who issued the card, the retailer, the retailer's bank and the card user, will be affected by the cap. They account for the lion's share of the market.The price cap will not initially apply to the so-called three-party card schemes, such as Diners and American Express, which involve only one bank. Retailers will also be free to choose which cards to accept, effectively ending the so-called 'Honour All Cards' rule.Visa said that could be bad for consumers if they are unsure if their card will be accepted.Commercial cards used only for business expenses would be exempt from the new price cap.These caps will take effect six months after the legislation enters into force. It first needs to be endorsed by EU governments and by the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, before being put to a vote by the full parliament next year.Regulators in individual EU countries are also investigating the cards industry.In Britain, where 70 percent of Europe's credit cards are held, the financial watchdog is assessing the way cards are sold amid concerns that poorer customers are trapped in a spiral of debt on their cards.($1 = 0.8143 euros)   (Additional reporting by Steve Slater in London; editing by Keith Weir)",2014-12-18,V,"Thu Dec 18, 2014 | 9:03am EST",UPDATE 1-EU agrees deal to cap bank card payment fees,http://www.reuters.com//article/eu-payments-cards-idUSL6N0U216F20141218?type=companyNews
124,"  (Adds presidential spokesman comments, paragraph 7; updates prisoner totals, paragraph 2)* Bus, train suspension creates Crimea transport blockade* Prisoner swap follows talks on Wednesday* Visa, Mastercard stop supporting bank cards in CrimeaBy Pavel Polityuk and Alessandra  PrenticeKIEV, Dec 26 Ukraine's government and pro-Russian separatists on Friday exchanged hundreds of prisoners of war while Kiev said it would suspend all train and bus service to Crimea, effectively creating a transportation blockade to and from the region.The agreement to swap 150 Ukrainian servicemen for 222 rebels followed peace talks between envoys of Ukraine, Russia, the separatists and European security watchdog Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) on Wednesday.Ukrainian transportation chiefs said the reason for suspending train and bus service was the need to protect passengers due to a ""deteriorating"" security situation on the Black Sea peninsula, annexed by Russia in March. Crimea is controlled by Russia, but its only land link is with Ukraine and it has remained dependent on the Ukrainian mainland for most of its supplies, including much of its electricity and water. Ukraine already has banned sea and air traffic with Crimea, which is still serviced by Russian airlines.Other road transportation including passenger cars and trucks will still be allowed to travel into and out of Crimea.State rail company Ukrzaliznytsia said cargo trains would be suspended beginning on Friday, while passenger routes would gradually cease running over the weekend and on Monday. PRISONER EXCHANGE ""The head of the SBU (security service) reported the release of 146 Ukrainians to the President. The SBU expects another four prisoners to be released tomorrow. They will all be able to celebrate New Year ... with their families,"" Svyatoslav Tsegolko, a spokesman for President Petro Poroshenko, said in a Facebook post.Earlier, an SBU aide had said they would hand over 225 rebels for the Ukrainian servicemen.It is not known exactly how many prisoners are held by the two sides, but Ukraine's military said this month about 600 Ukrainians were in rebel hands. In addition, Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc, the world's two largest credit and debit card companies, said they could no longer support bank cards being used in Crimea  following U.S. sanctions imposed earlier this month.The United States last Friday prohibited U.S.-registered companies from investing in Crimea or providing services to companies operating there, among measures imposed over Russia's annexation of the peninsula from Ukraine.Russia's takeover of Crimea, an annexation Kiev does not recognise, pushed relations between Moscow and the West to their lowest point since the Cold War.Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a new military doctrine, naming NATO expansion among key external risks, the Kremlin said on Friday, days after Ukraine made fresh steps to join the Atlantic military alliance.The uprising by separatists began a month after Russia annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine in March, following the popular overthrow of Ukraine's Moscow-backed president. The conflict has killed more than 4,700 people.Kiev's pro-Western government has said Russia orchestrated the rebellion in Ukraine's east, a charge denied by Moscow.Violence arising from Kiev's conflict with pro-Russian separatists has been confined almost exclusively to eastern regions of Ukraine and has not affected Crimea. But the Ukrainian government has repeatedly warned of a build-up of Russian forces on the peninsula.

The stock was the second-biggest loser on the London Stock Exchange.""The market is telling us that investors very much doubt that Monitise will find a proper buyer,"" said Exane BNP Paribas analyst Alexandre Faure. ""IBM is going to be probably the most speculated buyer,"" Faure added, saying other potential bidders included MasterCard Inc and other banking software vendors eyeing Monitise's high profile relationships, if not their technology.The company provides payment solutions to 350 financial institutions, including Royal Bank of Scotland, MasterCard and Santander. Monitise also said on Thursday that it expected a full-year EBITDA loss of between $60 million and $76 million, wider than market estimates.Prior to the announcement, the company's 2015 EBITDA loss was forecast at 33.24 million pounds ($50.4 million), according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.However, the company said it still expected an EBITDA profit in 2016, helped by cost savings from the re-shaping of the business. Monitise, which warned on revenue twice last year citing the same changes to its business model, has shed over 70 percent of its market value since the start of 2014.The company was also hit hard in September when its biggest customer, Visa Inc, revealed plans to divest its stake in Monitise and pursue its own mobile payment systems.Monitise said it now expected full-year revenue to be between $136 million and $151 million, compared with its previous forecast of an ""at least 25 percent growth"" on its revenue of $143.7 million in the year ended June 30, 2014.The company's AIM-listed shares recovered some of their early losses and were down 10 percent at 0923 GMT.

129,"   By Amrutha Gayathri  Visa Inc (V.N), the world's largest credit and debit card company, reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday as a strengthening U.S. job market and cheaper gasoline prices encouraged people to spend.The company said e-commerce, which mainly uses cards, was ""extraordinarily strong during the holiday season.""But Chief Executive Charlie Scharf said consumer spending on the whole, while at ""reasonable"" levels, was not accelerating.Shares of the company, which also announced a 4-for-1 split of its class A common stock, rose about 4 percent in extended trading.Visa, which earns money from both the volume and value of transactions using its cards, said total volume increased to $1.90 trillion from $1.84 trillion.The company stands to benefit from China's recent decision to allow foreign card networks to clear domestic transactions, but Scharf said it remained unclear when the Chinese market would actually open and what the rules would look like. Visa lost its right to process domestic payments in Russia in the middle of last year when Moscow hit back after the imposition of Western sanctions over its role in Ukraine.Visa reaffirmed its revenue and margin forecasts for 2015 after taking into account an expected 2 percentage point negative impact from changes in foreign exchange rates.About 60 percent of Visa's transaction volumes are outside the United States. ""The stronger-than-anticipated U.S. dollar has led to substantially reduced travel into the U.S. from Europe, Canada, and Latin America,"" Chief Financial Officer Byron Pollitt said on a conference call with analysts.Visa, a Dow Jones Industrial Average component, recorded cross-border volume growth of 8 percent on a constant dollar basis, down from 12 percent in the year-earlier quarter.The company's net income rose to $1.57 billion, or $2.53 per Class A share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31 from $1.41 billion, or $2.20 per Class A share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $2.49 per share on revenue of $3.34 billion for the company's first fiscal quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Total operating revenue rose 7 percent to $3.38 billion.Up to Thursday's close of $248, Visa's shares had gained about 15.5 percent since it last reported earnings on Oct. 29.

If the S&P closes January in the red, it would be its first back-to-back monthly decline since April-May 2012.Chevron said it plans to spend $35 billion this year on oil and gas projects, 13 percent less than in 2014. The bulk of that amount - $23.4 billion - will be on projects outside the United States. Shares fell 2.5 percent to $100.44.Google Inc shares rose 4 percent to $533.68 even as revenue growth of 15 percent in the fourth quarter fell short of Wall Street's target.Visa rose 4.7 percent to $259.67 after it reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit and announced a 4-for-1 split of its class A common stock.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 2,170 to 782, for a 2.77-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 1,974 issues fell and 585 advanced for a 3.37-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.The benchmark S&P 500 index was posting 10 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 31 new highs and 52 new lows.

135,"   By Amrutha Gayathri  Visa Inc (V.N), the world's largest credit and debit card company, reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday due to a good holiday season and a strengthening U.S. job market that encouraged people to spend.The company said e-commerce, which mainly uses cards, was ""extraordinarily strong during the holiday season.""But Chief Executive Charlie Scharf said consumer spending on the whole, while at ""reasonable"" levels, was not accelerating.Shares of the company, which also announced a 4-for-1 split of its class A common stock, rose about 4 percent in extended trading.Visa, which earns money from both the volume and value of transactions using its cards, said total volume increased to $1.90 trillion from $1.84 trillion.The company stands to benefit from China's recent decision to allow foreign card networks to clear domestic transactions, but Scharf said it remained unclear when the Chinese market would actually open and what the rules would look like. Visa lost its right to process domestic payments in Russia in the middle of last year when Moscow hit back after the imposition of Western sanctions over its role in Ukraine.Visa reaffirmed its revenue and margin forecasts for 2015 after taking into account an expected 2 percentage point negative impact from changes in foreign exchange rates.About 60 percent of Visa's transaction volumes are outside the United States. ""The stronger-than-anticipated U.S. dollar has led to substantially reduced travel into the U.S. from Europe, Canada, and Latin America,"" Chief Financial Officer Byron Pollitt said on a conference call with analysts.Visa, a Dow Jones Industrial Average component, recorded cross-border volume growth of 8 percent on a constant dollar basis, down from 12 percent in the year-earlier quarter.The company's net income rose to $1.57 billion, or $2.53 per Class A share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31 from $1.41 billion, or $2.20 per Class A share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $2.49 per share on revenue of $3.34 billion for the company's first fiscal quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Total operating revenue rose 7 percent to $3.38 billion.Up to Thursday's close of $248, Visa's shares had gained about 15.5 percent since it last reported earnings on Oct. 29.

137,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK American Express Co violated U.S. antitrust law by prohibiting merchants from steering consumers to use lower-cost credit cards, a federal judge ruled on Thursday, in the company's second major setback this month.The decision by U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn followed American Express' loss on Feb. 12 of a lucrative, exclusive partnership with warehouse retailer Costco Wholesale Corp.It is also a victory for the U.S. government and 17 states, which in 2010 sued American Express over allegations it forbade merchants from recommending to consumers which cards to use.The New York-based company's activities ""imposed actual, concrete harms on competition in the credit and charge card network services market,"" Garaufis wrote in a 150-page decision. He said he will decide on remedies later.American Express shares fell 1.7 percent.Card companies charge merchants more than $50 billion a year to process consumer transactions, the government said. Those fees have also spurred many years of litigation by the merchants themselves against the card companies.""Today's decision is a triumph for fair competition and for American consumers,"" U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement. ""By recognizing that American Express's rules harm competition, the court vindicates the promise of robust marketplaces that is enshrined in our antitrust laws.""APPEAL PLANNED American Express said it will appeal, and that Garaufis' decision would harm competition by ""further entrenching the two dominant payment networks,"" Visa and MasterCard. ""We believe that freedom of choice and fair competition are worth defending,"" American Express said.Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc had also been sued by the various governments over their ""anti-steering"" rules for merchants, but settled in 2011 by agreeing to make changes.""Large retailers can save a good chunk of money by encouraging customers to use cards like Visa and MasterCard,"" said Matt Schulz, senior industry analyst at CreditCards.com, an online marketplace. ""If a large retailer can go from paying 5 percent on a transaction to even 4 percent, that is a lot.""American Express has said its ""premium"" services justify its processing fees, which are higher than some rivals charge.It also said its merchant rules help it compete with Visa and MasterCard, which together have more than 1.1 billion cards in the United States versus 55 million for American Express. Garaufis, however, said American Express wrongfully exploited its 26.4 percent share of purchase volume in the U.S. credit and charge card market by banning merchants from giving incentives for consumers to use one card over another, or telling consumers they might be better off if they did.""There is nothing to offset credit card networks' incentives - including American Express's incentive - to charge merchants inflated prices for their services,"" the judge wrote. ""This, in turn, results in higher costs to all consumers who purchase goods and services from these merchants.""FREEDOM OF CHOICE Douglas Kantor, a partner at Steptoe & Johnson who represents the National Association of Convenience Stores,  welcomed the decision. ""It ought to open up the marketplace for more price competition where there isn't any at all today,"" he said in an interview. ""That helps merchants and consumers, because it can help keep prices down, and spur spending and economic activity.""Richard Dagen, an antitrust partner at Axinn, Veltrop & Harkrider, said the decision may make it easier for small or new rivals to compete with American Express, Visa and MasterCard.""You might have a chance for someone like Discover to make inroads,"" he said, referring to Discover Financial Services . ""Whenever that happens, you're likely to see lower prices for the merchants, which hopefully get passed on to consumers.""Garaufis ruled after presiding over a seven-week non-jury trial last summer.The lawsuit sought to force American Express to give merchants who accept its cards the freedom to encourage consumers ""to use any payment method they choose.""No money damages were sought, but American Express has said a loss could have a ""material adverse effect"" on its business.That could add to the loss of earnings stemming from the demise of its partnership with Costco, which began in 1999 and will end in March 2016.American Express is the only credit payment form accepted at Costco's U.S. stores. Costco last year decided to replace American Express as its card partner in Canada with MasterCard and Capital One Financial Corp.Shares of American Express closed down $1.38 at $78.40. Visa fell 2 cents to $269.10, and MasterCard rose $1.47 to $89.20.The case is U.S. et al v. American Express Co et al.

139,"  (Adds executives' comments, details on upcoming payments service and industry)By Abhirup Roy and Edwin ChanFeb 18 Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  has bought U.S. mobile wallet startup LoopPay, signalling its intention to launch a smartphone payments service to compete with a recent offering from rival Apple Inc.Mobile payments have been slow to catch on in the United States and elsewhere, despite strong backing. Apple, Google , and eBay Inc's PayPal have all launched services to allow users to pay in stores via smartphones.The weak uptake is partly because many retailers have been reluctant to adopt the hardware and software infrastructure required for these new mobile payment options to work. These services also fail to offer much more convenience than simply swiping a credit card, Samsung executives said on Wednesday.LoopPay's technology differs because it works off existing magnetic-stripe card readers at checkout, changing them into contactless receivers, they said. About 90 percent of checkout counters already support magnetic swiping. ""If you can't solve the problem of merchant acceptance..., of being able to use the vast majority of your cards, then it can't really be your wallet,"" said David Eun, head of Samsung's Global Innovation Center.Injong Rhee, who is leading Samsung's as-yet-unannounced payments project, said the Asian giant will soon reveal more details of its envisioned service. He would not be drawn on speculation the company may do so during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. He said new phones such as the upcoming, latest Galaxy would support the service.Apple Pay, launched in September, allows iPhone users to pay at the tap of a button. Executives have lauded its rapid rollout so far, including the fact that more than 2,000 banks now support it and the U.S. government will accept Apple Pay later this year.But Apple Pay requires retailers to install near-field communication and some have been reluctant. In addition, many retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc and CVS Health Corp, back their own system, CurrentC. Samsung had invested in LoopPay, along with Visa Inc  and Synchrony Financial, before its acquisition. Terms of the deal, which Samsung negotiated over several months, were not disclosed on Wednesday.It's unclear how else Samsung could differentiate its service versus Apple's or other rivals.Rhee said in an interview that the company intends to roll out accompanying services that go beyond merely turning the smartphone into a wallet, such as by allowing users access to information such as spending.""It's about changing user behaviour, it's not about who's first in the market,"" he said.

In its first three months, more than $2 out of every $3 which U.S. consumers spent using speedy new ""contactless"" systems at the three major credit card networks was done via Apple Pay, the company said last month.Visa Europe's move is one of several new services the London-based credit card giant is unveiling as it battles to retain its role as a middleman connecting banks and consumers in a fast-moving payments landscape being shaken up by major technology firms including Apple, Google (GOOGL.O) and eBay's (EBAY.O) PayPal, as well as scores of ambitious start-ups.These include a way for card customers to send money overseas to other Visa users via their social media profiles on sites such as Facebook (FB.O), WhatsApp, Twitter (TWTR.N) or LinkedIn LNKD.N. Steve Perry, Visa Europe's chief digital officer, said in an interview his association's plan for secure credit card data transmission parallels what Visa Inc offers in the United States. But he declined to comment on whether Apple Pay had agreed to use his organization's version in European markets.       ""Apple and Visa (Inc) have an agreement around what has happened,"" Perry said. ""I am as excited as anyone, but we have to wait,"" he said.

The company said it would introduce by this summer a global peer-to-peer payments service called Visa Direct, which was formerly known as Visa Personal Payments and offered on a limited basis.Visa Europe has partnered with Singapore-based Fastacash to enable its member banks to soon start sending peer-to-peer payments via popular social media services.Visa Direct will allow Visa Europe card users to transfer funds in multiple currencies to the mobile phone numbers of nearly 2 billion other Visa card holders.The personal money transfer service, which complies with ""Know your customer"" banking regulations and other international rules, will not be available in the United States, Japan or nations sanctioned by U.S. Treasury Department, it said.

147,"   By Oksana Kobzeva | MOSCOW, March 27  MOSCOW, March 27 Visa still needs one or two months to transfer processing of transactions made on its credit cards in Russia to a local payment system, but Mastercard will make an obligatory April 1 deadline, the head of the payment system said.Russian authorities ordered foreign card companies to move processing of their transactions in Russia to a newly created local payment system by April 1 or put down a hefty security deposit.The new rules were introduced after Visa and Mastercard stopped providing services for some Russian banks that were sanctioned over Moscow's role in the Ukraine crisis.""With Mastercard the project is completed, all the banks are signed up. With Visa there is a fully fledged project, which has been agreed. Signing up and certifying the banks is under way,""Vladimir Komlev told journalists in comments agreed for publication on Friday.""There is an understanding of the time frame (for Visa) to complete the project, around one to two months."" Foreign card companies whose local transactions aren't processed in Russia must from April 1 deposit collateral related to the average daily turnover on their cards with the central bank to ensure Russian customers don't suffer if they halt services in the country.Komlev declined to comment on whether Visa would have to pay the security deposit, and Visa refused comment on the issue.On Friday, Visa said its cards would continue to function normally until it completely moved processing of transactions made on its cards in Russia to the local system. Russia's top lender Sberbank said transactions made on Mastercard cards it had issued would from Monday be processed by Russia's National Payment Card System, which is owned by the central bank.Rostislav Yanykin, head of Sberbank's bank cards department, said he did not know of any banks that had managed to transfer processing of Visa cards to the local payment system.""Visa is slightly more tricky than Mastercard,"" he said. ""They have an exchange protocol for cash machine operations that is much more difficult.""

149,"  April 14 Target Corp is nearing a settlement with MasterCard Inc to reimburse financial institutions about $20 million for costs incurred from the retailer's massive data breach in 2013, the Wall Street Journal reported.The deal, which comes after months of negotiations, could be announced as soon as this week, according to the Journal, citing people familiar with the terms of negotiations.The $20 million covers costs that banks incurred to reissue credit cards and debit cards as a result of the breach, as well as some of the fraud that resulted from the exposure of customer information, the newspaper said.In 2013, Target said at least 40 million credit cards were compromised by the breach during the holiday shopping season, and the attack might have resulted in the theft of personal information, such as email addresses and telephone numbers, from as many as 110 million people. MasterCard will distribute the reimbursed funds to the financial institutions that issue credit cards and debit cards under its brand, including Citigroup Inc, Capital One Financial Corp and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co, the Journal said. The Target settlement does not include financial institutions that issue under the Visa Inc brand. Target is negotiating separately with Visa, the report said.In March, according to court documents, Target agreed to pay $10 million in a proposed settlement of a class-action lawsuit related to the data breach. ""We've seen the same story, but we do not comment on speculation,"" MasterCard said when asked about the Journal's report.Visa were not available for comment, and a Target spokesperson said the company has not made any announcements and had no comment on the matter.

The reading was the weakest in a year and lower than the 1.0 percent rate forecast by economists polled by Reuters.Investors will closely examine the Fed's statement for clues on when rates are likely to be increased, as a batch of soft data could push back the timing of a hike until the end of the year. The statement is expected at 1400 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT).""I think the GDP data has to be taken with a grain of salt,"" said Chris Bertelsen, chief investment officer at Global Financial Private Capital in Sarasota, Florida, which oversees $4.5 billion in funds.""We saw this movie last year where the first quarter was weak but followed up with a stronger second and third quarters and you're going to see the same pattern this year too."" In contrast to the weak GDP numbers, other data showed that contracts to buy previously owned U.S. homes rose in March to their highest level since 2013.At 11:39 a.m. EDT (1539 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was down 76.64 points, or 0.42 percent, at 18,033.5, the S&P 500 was down 9.49 points, or 0.45 percent, at 2,105.27 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 27.47 points, or 0.54 percent, at 5,027.95.Earnings released on Wednesday painted a mixed picture. ""Corporate America is very, very busy trying to create earnings that justify the current pricing of the market,"" said Dave Heidel, regional investment manager at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis, which oversees $128 billion.Heidel said the consequence of companies cutting costs to boost earnings reflects in the poor GDP numbers, which were partly due to low corporate spending.Twitter dived 5.5 percent to $39.90, a day after the company cut its full-year forecast due to weak demand for its new direct response advertising.MasterCard rose 2.6 percent to $92.63 after reporting a better-than-expected profit. The results also pushed up Visa  1.7 percent to $67.95, making it the biggest gainer among stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.Lumber Liquidators slumped as much as 21 percent to a three-year low of $26.54 after the hardwood flooring retailer said the Department of Justice is seeking criminal charges related to its imports from China.Starwood Hotels rose 8.7 percent to touch a record high of $87.80 after it said it was exploring strategic and financial alternatives.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,993 to 937, for a 2.13-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 1,617 issues fell and 963 advanced for a 1.68-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.

CLOSE TIES FIFA's longest standing partners are Adidas and Coca-Cola Co.Adidas has been the provider of the World Cup match ball since 1970 and has a partnership lasting until 2030, while the current deal for Coca-Cola, which has had a formal association since 1974 and has advertised in every World Cup stadium since 1950, lasts until 2022.That perhaps explains why they stopped short of threatening to cut ties like Visa, the world's largest credit and debit card company, which only became a FIFA partner in 2007 and recently extended the relationship until 2022. ""This lengthy controversy has tarnished the mission and ideals of the FIFA World Cup and we have repeatedly expressed our concerns about these serious allegations,"" Coca Cola said.Adidas, which is the world's biggest manufacturer of soccer balls, boots and shirts, side stepped outright criticism, calling instead for FIFA ""to continue to establish and follow transparent compliance standards"". Its shares fell 1.5 percent on Thursday.Meanwhile, Nike, which is not a FIFA partner but is challenging Adidas' dominance in soccer by sponsoring many of the world's top players and teams, said it was cooperating with authorities after it was indirectly identified in the U.S. indictment in relation to a 1996 deal with the Brazil team. U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch declined to comment on whether there was any liability for companies that had won marketing rights and if they were being investigated. But she said ""the investigation is continuing and covers all aspects.""She declined to comment when asked if one of the companies was Nike.Nike later said in a statement it was ""concerned by the very serious allegations, adding: ""Nike believes in ethical and fair play in both business and sport and strongly opposes any form of manipulation or bribery.""OTHER SPONSORS BRISTLE FIFA's main sponsors were already getting uneasy even before the latest revelations. Adidas, Visa and Coca-Cola all made statements last week pushing FIFA to take seriously the issue of rights for migrant workers in Qatar, responding to reports of abuses at the 2022 World Cup construction sites. That came after campaigners designed spoof ads for major FIFA sponsors subverting their brand images, including a Coca-Cola can dripping with oil and the iconic three stripes of Adidas tweaked to look like a line of gravestones.The pressure only mounted after Wednesday's news, with social media full of appeals for brands to cut ties with FIFA. ""Adidas, Visa, Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Budweiser, Hyundai: stop supporting corrupt FIFA or I stop buying your brands,"" wrote Stefan-Joerg Goebel on Twitter. The Institute of Directors (IoD), a leading UK authority on corporate governance, said risks were mounting for sponsors.""They have a responsibility to their shareholders to make certain that the company’s cash is not going towards sporting events mired in bribery and corruption allegations,"" said Roger Barker, IoD director of corporate governance.South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor, the sole Asian FIFA partner for the 2018 World Cup due to be held in Russia, said it was ""extremely concerned"" about the legal proceedings, while Bud-owner Anheuser-Busch InBev and McDonald's Corp said they were in contact with FIFA.Australian sportswear company SKINS, which announced in a tongue-in-cheek campaign in January that it was the first ""official"" FIFA non-sponsor, urged the brands to clean up FIFA.""The only people FIFA will listen to are the sponsors. The real money is with the broadcasters but their brands aren't exposed in the same way as the sponsors,"" said SKINS chairman Jaimie Fuller.But brand experts were skeptical of a mass exodus of FIFA sponsors.""Football is one of the few global properties that enables you to connect with people around the world,"" said Interbrand Chief Executive Jez Frampton.

184,"  (Adds details, industry background)By Devika  Krishna Kumar and Mari SaitoJuly 20 PayPal Holdings Inc shares jumped as much as 11 percent in their highly anticipated return to the Nasdaq after more than a decade in eBay Inc's  fold, valuing the digital payment processor at about $52 billion.PayPal is a giant in the market it helped create - it processed 4 billion payments totaling about $235 billion in 2014. But the online payments landscape has changed drastically since the company was snapped up by eBay in 2002.Freed from eBay, PayPal is now expected to partner with other e-commerce sites and try to seize market share from startups such as Stripe and Square and Apple Inc, which unveiled its own mobile payments service last year.For eBay, the separation allows the company to focus on its struggling e-commerce marketplace.PayPal shares soared to $42.55 in early trading. EBay's stock fell as much as 4.7 percent, valuing the company at about $32 billion. ""PayPal is the gorilla among independent digital payment service providers with more than 160 million active accounts, global scale and brand recognition,"" J.P. Morgan analysts said.PayPal is also looking to compete with Western Union Co  and other money transfer companies. CEO Dan Shulman said he was looking to use PayPal's size to offer affordable financial services widely.""It's clear that the potential for mobile technology to transform money extends beyond commerce. The vast majority of the world's 7 billion people lack access to even basic financial services,"" Schulman told Reuters. PayPal was founded in the late 1990s by venture capitalist Peter Thiel, Tesla Motors Inc CEO Elon Musk and others.

This helped AmEx report earnings of $1.42 per share instead of $1.32 per share as analysts had estimated, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.AmEx's net income attributable to common shareholders fell 5 percent to $1.44 billion as a stronger dollar cut into revenue from markets outside the United States. These markets account for about a sixth of the company's revenue.The dollar has gained about 21 percent against a basket of major currencies in the past 12 months.Shares of AmEx were down 2 percent at $77.40 in after-market trading. ""(AmEx did) better than our expectations on earnings, but people might focus on revenue being slightly weaker, though a lot of that is driven by FX,"" FBR & Co analyst Sanjay Sakhrani said.Total revenue, net of interest expense, fell 4 percent to $8.28 billion, dragged by a 9.6 percent decline in revenue from card services from markets outside the United States.Revenue from the U.S. Card Services business rose 6 percent to $4.7 billion, net of interest expense. Costs at this business rose 4 percent to $3 billion, partly driven by expenses from previously renewed co-brand partnerships, AmEx said.There is stiff competition in the industry to bag prominent ""co-brand"" deals, in which card issuers team up with prominent corporate partners - often supermarkets or airlines - to sell cards.AmEx, whose image relies on catering mainly to wealthy corporate clients, lost a couple of lucrative co-brand contracts this year because it charges higher prices than rivals.The company's exclusive tie-up with Costco in the United States will be given over to Citigroup and Visa Inc  in March. The deal accounted for 8 percent of spending on AmEx cards in 2014.AmEx said in February that the loss of the U.S. Costco contract would hurt earnings for the next two years.The company also ended a deal with JetBlue Airways.

196,"   By Rodrigo Campos  The S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted their largest weekly drops since March on Friday as slowing global growth dragged commodity-related stocks lower while an earnings-fueled drop in Biogen took down the biotech sector.Biogen (BIIB.O) more than halved its revenue growth forecast for 2015 and its stock lost 22 percent to close just above $300. Stocks in the energy and materials sectors weighed heavily on the market after weaker-than-expected economic data from China and the euro zone raised concerns about global growth. Oil prices hit their lowest since March.""You got underwhelming revenue growth on balance and then you layer on top of that concern over a global economic slowdown, that becomes self-fulfilling,"" Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York, said of the stock market weakness.Amazon (AMZN.O) was the bright spot on Friday, rising more than 20 percent at one point and closing up 10 percent at $530.50. The online retailer posted an unexpected quarterly profit and its market cap ballooned to $247 billion, making it the tenth-largest U.S. company by market value.However, Amazon's spike highlighted the thinning of leadership in the S&P 500. Gains on the index so far this year can be attributed to Amazon and just three more companies. At the close of trading on Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 163.39 points, or 0.92 percent, to 17,568.53, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 22.5 points, or 1.07 percent, to 2,079.65 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 57.78 points, or 1.12 percent, to 5,088.63.For the week, the S&P fell 2.2 percent and the Nasdaq slid 2.3 percent in their largest weekly drops since the last week of March. The 2.9 percent fall on the Dow was the largest for any week since January. Selling in stocks accelerated after a report from the Wall Street Journal said Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will propose nearly doubling the U.S. capital gains tax rate on short-term investments. Second-quarter S&P 500 earnings have been mixed, with 74 percent of companies beating analysts' profit expectations but just 52 percent surpassing revenue expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data.Adding to the concerns regarding lukewarm earnings, the S&P 500 is relatively expensive, trading at 16.9 times forward 12 months' earnings, above the 10-year median of 14.7 times, according to StarMine data.Dow component Visa (V.N) ended up 4.3 percent at $74.80 after the credit and debit card company's results handily beat expectations. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 2,246 to 831, for a 2.70-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 2,144 issues fell and 660 advanced for a 3.25-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.The benchmark S&P 500 index posted 13 new 52-week highs and 54 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 50 new highs and 200 new lows.Some 7.3 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the daily average of 6.6 billion so far this month.

209,"   By David Ingram | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A U.S. judge on Tuesday rejected a proposed class action settlement between American Express Co (AXP.N) and merchants who sued the company over swipe fees, ruling that a lawyer for the merchants compromised the fairness of the agreement.U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn, New York, ruled that lawyer Gary Friedman acted improperly by talking about the case and sharing confidential information with a friend who represented MasterCard Inc (MA.N) in a parallel class action against MasterCard and Visa Inc (V.N).Garaufis wrote that Friedman repeatedly violated court rules meant to protect confidential information and created a conflict of interest. The violations were so blatant that in at least two emails, Friedman wrote to his friend, ""burn after reading."" Garaufis ordered Friedman removed as co-lead counsel for the merchants and ordered a new round of written briefs to be filed in the case by Sept. 8.Two lawyers who represent Friedman could not immediately be reached for comment. The proposed antitrust settlement would have allowed merchants to impose a surcharge on American Express users, potentially treating those cardholders differently from other customers. Such settlements generally require court approval.Merchants were not due to receive any money from the agreement, although Friedman and two other law firms that served as co-lead counsel were due to receive $75 million in fees. American Express said in a statement it was disappointed in the ruling because it considered the settlement agreement fair. It added: ""We believe we have strong defenses against the merchants’ claims, and will continue to fight our case in court.""

210,"   By Simon Evans | ZURICH  ZURICH World Cup sponsor McDonald’s has joined Coca-Cola and Visa in urging FIFA to adopt an independent reform commission in response to the scandals that have plagued world soccer’s governing body.The campaign group New FIFA Now on Thursday published an email from a McDonald's saying the fast food giant supports the creation of an independent body to deal with FIFA’s problems.    “In regards to an independent reform commission, we do believe this is an important step in the greater reform that has to happen within FIFA,” McDonald’s vice-president of global media relations and issues management, Heidi Barker Sa Shekhem wrote in the email.      Previously, McDonald’s had been critical of FIFA and urged change without specifically calling for an independent reform process.     “An independent commission would bring an appropriate level of credibility, transparency, and neutrality to the role, and ultimately provide sponsors and fans across the globe with the confidence that the reform effort is both meaningful and a step in the right direction,” wrote Sa Shekhem.    World soccer's governing body has been in crisis since May, when nine officials and five marketing executives were charged by the U.S. Justice Department with exploiting the sport for their own gain through bribes of more than $150 million over 24 years.    In the wake of the scandal, FIFA President Sepp Blatter has said he will stand down next February.     Last month FIFA announced they were creating a Reform Task Force made up of ten representatives of its regional confederations and to be chaired by someone from outside of soccer.    That body, which has yet to have its membership announced, is scheduled to make its proposals to FIFA’s executive committee in late September.    Campaigners were critical of the move, saying only an entirely independent body could bring about effective change.      “We applaud McDonald’s for joining with Coca-Cola and Visa. They understand just how vital it is that reform of FIFA is independent of the deep vested interests surrounding the organization and its personnel,” said New FIFA Now co-founder Jaimie Fuller.    FIFA general secretary Jerome Valcke has said he will meet with the organization's sponsors during August.

That body, which has yet to have its membership announced, is scheduled to make its proposals to FIFA's executive committee in late September.Campaigners were critical of the move, saying only an entirely independent body could bring about effective change.""We applaud McDonald's for joining with Coca-Cola and Visa. They understand just how vital it is that reform of FIFA is independent of the deep vested interests surrounding the organisation and its personnel,"" said New FIFA Now co-founder Jaimie Fuller.FIFA general secretary Jerome Valcke has said he will meet with the organisation's sponsors during August.

222,"  (Repeats for additional subscribers)By David HenryNEW YORK, Sept 8 JPMorgan Chase & Co. is cutting prices for a group of its credit card customers and getting Visa Inc to shoulder at least some of the burden of the lost revenue, underscoring how the largest U.S. bank's size can help it hang onto business in fiercely competitive markets.At stake are the billions of dollars that banks receive annually from consumer use of a credit card to pay a retailer. Chase, which generated roughly $3.6 billion of revenue last year from those fees, is increasingly occupied with fending off banking rivals like Citigroup Inc, as well as Silicon Valley companies such as Paypal Inc and Square Inc.Chase's revenue from those fees is showing signs of eroding. In the first half of 2015, fee income in the bank's credit and debit card business fell 2 percent from the same period a year earlier, even as the bank processed a higher volume of transactions. A person familiar with the matter said lower processing fees were a critical part of that decline.JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon pledged in an April letter to shareholders ""to be very aggressive in growing this business."" At a conference with securities analysts in February, he cited the credit card operation as an example of how JPMorgan has to cut prices and upgrade products to keep from falling behind competitors.""In a capitalist world,"" Dimon said, ""you've got to be giving the client more, better, faster, quicker, or you lose.""Credit card fees generated about 4 percent of the bank's revenue in 2014, but analysts said that much of that money has historically fallen to the bottom line, making it a critical support for the bank's $22 billion of annual profits.To stem the decline, Chase is assembling a vast array of parts into what will become either a brilliant machine or a makeshift disappointment. A key part of the strategy came in 2013, when Chase inked a deal with Visa that allowed the bank to essentially lease Visa's network for 10 years at what industry sources said is a fixed rate.There are some signs that the Visa deal is starting to pay off for Chase. This year, the bank won the right to process credit card transactions for customers of Marriott International at some 3,700 hotels in the U.S. and Canada and for Chevron USA at nearly 8,000 gas stations.Steve Mott, an independent payments consultant said, ""Fizzle was the watchword until they got the Chevron deal.""Some wonder if the bank is wasting its time. ""So far, there is no evidence that it has mattered in a way that changes market share,"" said veteran card company analyst Craig Maurer of Autonomous Research.BRAINCHILD Chase's efforts are the brainchild of Gordon Smith, the head of JPMorgan's consumer business, who joined Chase in 2007 after 26 years at American Express. He is trying to recreate large parts of American Express inside of JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank by assets.An American Express spokeswoman declined to comment.To imitate American Express, Smith needed a few components. When a consumer pays for a sweater at a department store with a credit card, three parties usually get involved: money moves from the bank that issues the consumer's credit card through a network like Visa or MasterCard to the bank that processes transactions for the retailer. Each of those three, the two banks and the network, collects a fee for its role. American Express usually occupies all three links of the chain. But Chase, without borrowing Visa's network, was only able to be two of the three: the bank for retailers and the bank that issued the credit card to the consumer.The deal that Chase signed with Visa allows the bank to essentially serve as all three links, which in the near term gives it more leeway to cut costs.Longer term, the deal with Visa will allow Chase to corral more information about what its customers are up to, said Mike Passilla, the Chase executive running this effort, in an interview.When a retailer uses Chase to process its credit card transactions, it can now sign up for a service known as ChaseNet, which means that when a consumer buys something with a credit card issued by Chase, the bank will process the transaction from start to finish, essentially serving as all three links in the chain. When that happens, Chase can charge the retailers lower fees for processing partly because of terms it negotiated with Visa, although the details of how much lower the charges can be have not been disclosed.Consumers may never know that ChaseNet exists. Their cards feature a Visa brand, and they can use them wherever Visa cards are accepted.ChaseNet works only when Chase is both the consumer's bank and the retailer's bank. That could happen fairly often, because Chase is second only to American Express among U.S. issuers in spending on cards, with market share of 19.4 percent last year, according to the Nilson Report. Chase is the biggest U.S. card issuer by outstanding balances, according to Nilson.Having the chance to cut fees for retailers is important now because many merchants are pressing on every front for lower processing costs. Retailers have won court cases against card companies over pricing in recent years. Mark Horwedel, CEO of the Merchants Advisory Group, said merchants expect more concessions because they have seen regulators in Europe move to cap fees on credit cards at about 15 percent of U.S. levels.Costco Wholesale Corp is widely believed to have chiseled lower fees out of Citigroup and Visa when it decided to stop using American Express as its transaction processing bank, and to stop putting its brand on American Express cards. Costco declined to comment on the specific terms of its agreement with Citi and Visa.Neither Visa, nor Chase, which is the biggest issuer of its cards, have disclosed the terms of their deal, but payments experts believe both sides had reasons to sign on the dotted line.For Visa, it was the chance to lock in 10 years of business from the biggest issuer on their network, without the fear of their fleeing for rival MasterCard Inc.For Chase, the deal gives it the chance to run as much additional volume over the network as it can gather for no extra cost, which gives it more leeway to cut rates to retailers, two people in the industry said.The bank's sales pitch has worked on at least some companies.Michael Cullen, a finance executive for Marriott International, said that Chase's deal with his hotel company will yield ""significant"" cost savings. He added that the bank's history of investments in its credit card business gives him confidence that Chase will keep up with technology and customer demand for advanced payment devices and spending information.""Payment processing is such an important part of the business,"" Cullen said.

A person familiar with the matter said lower processing fees were a critical part of that decline.JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon pledged in an April letter to shareholders ""to be very aggressive in growing this business."" At a conference with securities analysts in February, he cited the credit card operation as an example of how JPMorgan has to cut prices and upgrade products to keep from falling behind competitors.""In a capitalist world,"" Dimon said, ""you've got to be giving the client more, better, faster, quicker, or you lose.""Credit card fees generated about 4 percent of the bank's revenue in 2014, but analysts said that much of that money has historically fallen to the bottom line, making it a critical support for the bank's $22 billion of annual profits.To stem the decline, Chase is assembling a vast array of parts into what will become either a brilliant machine or a makeshift disappointment. A key part of the strategy came in 2013, when Chase inked a deal with Visa that allowed the bank to essentially lease Visa's network for 10 years at what industry sources said is a fixed rate.There are some signs that the Visa deal is starting to pay off for Chase. This year, the bank won the right to process credit card transactions for customers of Marriott International at some 3,700 hotels in the U.S. and Canada and for Chevron USA at nearly 8,000 gas stations.Steve Mott, an independent payments consultant said, ""Fizzle was the watchword until they got the Chevron deal.""Some wonder if the bank is wasting its time.""So far, there is no evidence that it has mattered in a way that changes market share,"" said veteran card company analyst Craig Maurer of Autonomous Research. BRAINCHILD Chase's efforts are the brainchild of Gordon Smith, the head of JPMorgan's consumer business, who joined Chase in 2007 after 26 years at American Express. He is trying to recreate large parts of American Express inside of JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank by assets.An American Express spokeswoman declined to comment.To imitate American Express, Smith needed a few components. When a consumer pays for a sweater at a department store with a credit card, three parties usually get involved: money moves from the bank that issues the consumer's credit card through a network like Visa or MasterCard to the bank that processes transactions for the retailer. Each of those three, the two banks and the network, collects a fee for its role. American Express usually occupies all three links of the chain. But Chase, without borrowing Visa's network, was only able to be two of the three: the bank for retailers and the bank that issued the credit card to the consumer.The deal that Chase signed with Visa allows the bank to essentially serve as all three links, which in the near term gives it more leeway to cut costs.Longer term, the deal with Visa will allow Chase to corral more information about what its customers are up to, said Mike Passilla, the Chase executive running this effort, in an interview.When a retailer uses Chase to process its credit card transactions, it can now sign up for a service known as ChaseNet, which means that when a consumer buys something with a credit card issued by Chase, the bank will process the transaction from start to finish, essentially serving as all three links in the chain. When that happens, Chase can charge the retailers lower fees for processing partly because of terms it negotiated with Visa, although the details of how much lower the charges can be have not been disclosed.Consumers may never know that ChaseNet exists. Their cards feature a Visa brand, and they can use them wherever Visa cards are accepted.ChaseNet works only when Chase is both the consumer's bank and the retailer's bank. That could happen fairly often, because Chase is second only to American Express among U.S. issuers in spending on cards, with market share of 19.4 percent last year, according to the Nilson Report. Chase is the biggest U.S. card issuer by outstanding balances, according to Nilson.Having the chance to cut fees for retailers is important now because many merchants are pressing on every front for lower processing costs. Retailers have won court cases against card companies over pricing in recent years. Mark Horwedel, CEO of the Merchants Advisory Group, said merchants expect more concessions because they have seen regulators in Europe move to cap fees on credit cards at about 15 percent of U.S. levels.Costco Wholesale Corp is widely believed to have chiseled lower fees out of Citigroup and Visa when it decided to stop using American Express as its transaction processing bank, and to stop putting its brand on American Express cards. Costco declined to comment on the specific terms of its agreement with Citi and Visa.Neither Visa, nor Chase, which is the biggest issuer of its cards, have disclosed the terms of their deal, but payments experts believe both sides had reasons to sign on the dotted line.For Visa, it was the chance to lock in 10 years of business from the biggest issuer on their network, without the fear of their fleeing for rival MasterCard Inc.For Chase, the deal gives it the chance to run as much additional volume over the network as it can gather for no extra cost, which gives it more leeway to cut rates to retailers, two people in the industry said.The bank's sales pitch has worked on at least some companies.Michael Cullen, a finance executive for Marriott International, said that Chase's deal with his hotel company will yield ""significant"" cost savings. He added that the bank's history of investments in its credit card business gives him confidence that Chase will keep up with technology and customer demand for advanced payment devices and spending information.""Payment processing is such an important part of the business,"" Cullen said. ""You're going to go with the provider that has the technology and the customer base and is investing.""

American Express lost a crucial relationship with Sam's Club competitor Costco Wholesale Corp earlier this year. Costco stopped accepting Amex cards exclusively, and switched to Visa instead. Citigroup Inc will issue Costco Visa credit cards. Amex said in February the loss of Costco would hurt its earnings for the next two years, and threaten nearly 8 percent of the worldwide annual spending on its cards.

226,"   By Joseph Ax  A U.S. judge on Tuesday certified a class action against Target Corp brought by several banks over the retailer's massive data breach in 2013.U.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson in St. Paul, Minnesota, said the banks could pursue their claims together over the breach, which compromised at least 40 million credit cards during the holiday season.In a statement, Charles Zimmerman, one of the lead lawyers representing the banks, said, ""This important ruling brings financial institutions one step closer to collectively holding Target accountable for its unprecedented data breach.""Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said the company was ""disappointed"" and would evaluate its next steps after reviewing the decision. The ruling, which makes a settlement with the banks more likely, comes four weeks after Target agreed to pay as much as $67 million to financial institutions that issue Visa Inc  cards, in a deal struck directly with the credit card network.Earlier this year, a proposed $19 million settlement with MasterCard Inc fell through when not enough banks accepted the agreement. It is not clear how many Visa card issuers accepted the terms of that deal by the deadline of Sept. 4.Snyder declined to comment on the number of institutions that have agreed to participate in the Visa deal but emphasized that the class action includes only those card issuers that have not settled their claims. Attorney Zimmerman has said the Visa deal, like the failed MasterCard settlement, does not fully reimburse banks for their losses and was negotiated without input from the plaintiffs.Carrie Hunt, the general counsel for the National Association of Federal Credit Unions, praised the judge's decision and said it ""constitutes one important avenue for recovery"" for credit unions affected by the breach.The Target breach was one in a series of high-profile data security failures to hit major retailers, including Home Depot Inc and Staples Inc.

Cards issued by Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc  will also be subject to the annual cash withdrawal limit, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) said in a statement on its website.The current rule only sets a daily withdrawal limit of 10,000 yuan per card.For the last three months of this year, the maximum amount of cash that can be withdrawn overseas using a single card will be 50,000 yuan, SAFE said. The step was aimed at curbing ""money laundering risks"" after it found some unusual activities among card holders, it said.""Recent monitoring found that some UnionPay card holders have made frequent, large cash withdrawals overseas, foreign financial regulators have also alerted on this,"" the SAFE said. The announcement by SAFE confirmed an earlier Reuters report.Chinese law prohibits individuals from transferring more than $50,000 out of the country per year, but overseas cash withdrawals via bank cards provided a regulatory loophole.The move coincided with recent steps by China to stem capital outflows. Banks have been told to bolster checks on foreign exchange transactions and identify ""abnormal"" cross-border fund transfers.Worries over China's economic slowdown and possible interest rate rises by the U.S. Federal Reserve have led to a wave of capital outflows that intensified after China's surprise yuan devaluation in August.

234,"  * Blatter says through U.S. lawyer he will not go* Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Visa, Budweiser demand departure* FIFA image tarnished by Swiss criminal probe of Blatter   (Update with comments)By Mica Rosenberg and Simon EvansNEW YORK/ZURICH, Oct 2 Major soccer sponsors on Friday issued coordinated calls for the immediate resignation of FIFA president Sepp Blatter in the most significant move by companies supporting the sport since a bribery and corruption scandal erupted at world football's governing body last May.Coca-Cola Co, McDonald's, Visa, and Budweiser owner Anheuser-Busch InBev, companies that have long linked their brand names to soccer, on Friday demanded Blatter step down immediately in a strong push for change at the organization. Blatter earlier announced he would resign in February next year.The sponsor statements, all using similar language, came just a week after Swiss authorities said they were opening a criminal investigation into Blatter, the 79-year-old Swiss national who has lead FIFA for the past 17 years.AB InBev said it has been ""actively engaged"" in the FIFA reform process as part of a group of sponsors. ""Every day that passes, the image and reputation of FIFA continues to tarnish,"" Coca Cola said. ""FIFA needs comprehensive and urgent reform, and that can only be accomplished through a truly independent approach.""Visa and McDonald's joined the call for Blatter to step aside.""The events of recent weeks have continued to diminish the reputation of FIFA and public confidence in its leadership,"" McDonald's said in an emailed statement. Blatter responded by saying he would not resign, setting the stage for a battle over who should take the helm in the next few months before February when elections are set for a new FIFA president.In a statement from his U.S. lawyer Richard Cullen, Blatter said he believed leaving office would not be in FIFA's best interest or advance the needed reforms of the organization.Scandals surrounding global soccer exploded in May, when 14 soccer officials and sports marketing executives were indicted on U.S. charges of racketeering, money laundering and wire fraud in relation to bribery schemes that dated back decades.Last Friday, the Swiss Office of the Attorney General said it opened a criminal investigation into Blatter on suspicion of criminal mismanagement and misappropriation of funds. It was the first time that authorities investigating corruption in the world's most popular sport had pointed the finger directly at Blatter.He has denied wrongdoing and his U.S. attorney said he was cooperating with the Swiss probe.FIFA's awarding of the 2018 and 2022 competitions to Russia and Qatar is one of the strands under scrutiny from U.S. and Swiss authorities investigating corruption in the organization, a worry for tournament sponsors including McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Visa.""One of the things consumers are looking for in brands today is for them to be responsible,"" said Trevor Wade from the brand consultancy firm Landor. She said the moves by the sponsors was a way to take a public stand about something they think matters to customers.It is an unprecedented decision by companies that have largely stood back as developments in the case unfolded in recent months, said Jaimie Fuller a co-founder of campaign group #NewFifaNow.""The drastic nature of this call stresses the extreme problems faced by FIFA,"" Fuller said, ""and should show everybody how the sports governing body is teetering on the abyss.""

237,"   By Steve Slater | LONDON  LONDON Europe's banks are in line to share billions of euros from a buyout of Visa Europe by its U.S. sister company Visa Inc. (V.N), which is expected to be sealed in the next two weeks, sources said.Credit card company Visa is in talks to buy Visa Europe, and proceeds would then be shared by more than 3,000 banks and payment firms that own the network.Visa Inc. wants to re-unite with the European arm to give it more global scale to compete with arch-rival MasterCard (MA.N). It said in July it wanted to conclude talks by the end of October.Sources familiar with the matter said the deal was close to being agreed, with one saying it is earmarked for Oct. 23 or shortly afterwards, once the boards formally approve a deal.Sky News has previously reported Visa Inc.'s offer is worth $21 billion.Britain's Barclays (BARC.L) could get about $2 billion from a deal, as banks will be paid based on how much business they account for on the Visa Europe network. The data are not publicly available but Barclays accounts for about 10 percent of the business, industry sources estimated. The windfall would be a welcome boost for a European banking sector hit hard over the last few years by the global financial crisis, fines and tighter regulation.The sources estimated British banks account for about 40 percent of Visa Europe's card payments, so could be in line to receive about $8 billion, or more than 5 billion pounds. Much of the remaining activity is in France, Spain and Italy.That could see major banks including Lloyds (LLOY.L), Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L), HSBC (HSBA.L), Santander (SAN.MC) and BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) in line for hundreds of millions of euros each, sources said.Visa Europe declined to comment and Visa Inc. did not immediately return requests for comment. Visa Europe processed 16.1 billion transactions last year and its cards are used to pay for 1 euro in every 6.1 euros spent in the region. The structure of the deal is expected to include an upfront payment and some deferred payments, the sources said.That is a complicating factor, however. Any payments that depend on future performance-related measures could be regarded as ""locking in"" banks to the Visa system and be seen as anti-competitive if they extend for several years, sources said. Another complicating factor regards potential future legal costs due to the threat of lawsuits related to past interchange charges, fees paid between banks on card transactions. Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have waged lengthy battles against interchange charges and the EU this year capped fees on purchases by debit and credit cards, which will come into effect in December.Visa Europe made a pre-tax profit of 343 million euros  ($389.3 million) in the year to the end of September 2014, on revenues of 1.3 billion euros. It dominates the debit card market, although MasterCard has a bigger share of the credit card market.Under a long-standing agreement Visa Europe has a put option which would oblige Visa Inc to buy it at a price calculated by a formula. Visa Inc. is also free to make an offer to Visa Europe at any time and price.

The data are not publicly available but Barclays accounts for about 10 percent of the business, industry sources estimated. The sources also estimated British banks account for about 40 percent of Visa Europe's card payments, so could be in line to receive about $8 billion, or more than 5 billion pounds. Much of the remaining activity is in France, Spain and Italy.That could see major banks including Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, Santander and BNP Paribas in line for hundreds of millions of euros each, sources said. Visa Inc. wants to re-unite with the European arm to give it more global scale to compete with arch-rival MasterCard.It said in July it was in talks to unite with Visa Europe and wanted to conclude talks on a deal by the end of October.Visa Europe declined to comment and Visa Inc. could not immediately be reached.

241,"  * Foreign firms may have to partner with local cos - sources* China Unionpay currently has monopoly on payment card market* Forcing foreign cos into partnerships may breach 2012 WTO ruling* China tipped to be world's biggest payment card market by 2020By Matthew Miller and Michael MartinaBEIJING, Oct 27 China is considering imposing tough new conditions on overseas bank card providers such as Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc, in a potential setback to their plans to enter the country's $7 trillion card payments market, according to people familiar with discussions.Industry sources, lawyers and U.S. business lobbies are worried that Chinese regulators will push foreign card firms to operate through a domestic consortium and may try to force them to partner with local companies and governments, reducing the amount of control they would have over their businesses and limiting their returns.Such measures, if implemented, would be a blow to global card payment firms, which have been lobbying for more than a decade to access the world's fastest-growing cards market, projected to become the biggest by 2020.It may also defy a 2012 World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling that found China was discriminating against U.S. credit card firms by allowing China UnionPay, a state-controlled consortium, a monopoly on all yuan payment cards issued and used in the country.The State Council, the government's cabinet, announced in April that China would open the card market to all properly-licensed domestic and foreign businesses, a move precipitated by the 2012 WTO ruling.But possible new conditions have been raised in discussions between card companies and domestic enterprises and municipal governments in the months since the People's Bank of China (PBOC) issued its draft implementation regulations, sources told Reuters on condition of anonymity.Jeremie Waterman, Greater China executive director at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, told the U.S. Trade Representative this month in testimony that any foreign card provider may be required to join a domestic consortium to get a licence, limiting their operational control. ""We hope the State Council's April decision ... will allow qualified foreign electronic payments firms to set up bank clearing operations in the near future - even as we are receiving reports that Chinese regulators may award new licences only to those foreign companies that partner with domestic companies,"" Waterman said.There have also been discussions about whether to limit the number of licences granted to the foreign card companies, with the possibility that just one or two might be issued, sources said on condition of anonymity.""The concern on the number of licences that will be issued to foreign companies is still there,"" one lawyer familiar with the issue told Reuters.Industry watchers expect the PBOC's implementation regulations to be out imminently.The PBOC declined to comment on the issue and China's Ministry of Commerce did not respond to a request for comment. UNWRITTEN RULES The initial qualifications that were publicly outlined by the State Council earlier this year were already seen as onerous by some legal professionals, including requirements that applicants hold 1 billion yuan ($157 million) in registered capital in a local company, and store data and infrastructure inside mainland China.Even if the new conditions are not included in the text of the forthcoming PBOC regulations, there are concerns they could be imposed as unwritten rules.""If you look at other sectors, they are making those kinds of demands in high-tech, automobiles, and commercial airliners. So, that general pressure for foreign companies to partner with state-owned companies is growing,"" said Scott Kennedy, Director of the Project on Chinese Business and Political Economy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.Kennedy said that while lawyers would debate whether such requirements comply with China's WTO mandate, they would be inconsistent with the spirit of the 2012 ruling and Beijing's original commitment to open access to financial markets. ""I think people would read it for what it is - wanting to make sure that whatever access is given to foreign companies, the benefits still accrue to domestic companies,"" Kennedy said.A spokeswoman for Visa declined to comment.MasterCard told Reuters it ""has established strong industry partnerships"" in China and that open payment systems would promote growth and reduce systemic risk.""We will continue to monitor closely and look forward to the day when we can compete for domestic business in China,"" the company said in a statement.MasterCard and UnionPay signed an agreement in 2010 to issue co-branded cards that Chinese people could use when travelling overseas.Critics have argued China's limitations on foreign card players sought to protect the country's then nascent domestic industry from competition, allowing UnionPay unfettered access at a time of explosive growth in the interbank card market.Currently, China requires all foreign card companies to use UnionPay's network when accepting yuan payments, effectively giving it a cut of every credit or debit card transaction.Foreign card issuers in most other countries pay only the bank involved in the transaction because they can use their own networks.At the same time, UnionPay has been expanding rapidly outside China as it battles MasterCard and Visa for global market share.UnionPay is now the world's largest card brand with more than 5 billion cards issued internationally since its founding in 2002.

242,"   By Richa Naidu and Sudarshan Varadhan  Visa Inc (V.N) said on Monday it would buy former subsidiary Visa Europe Ltd for up to $23.3 billion in a deal that will give the world's largest payments network a chance to cut costs over the long term and raise fees in the second-biggest card market.The price for the long-anticipated deal was higher than many had expected, but ended a period of strategic uncertainty that had dogged Visa in recent months.Visa Inc and Visa Europe, a cooperative of European banks with more than 500 million cards, were part of a global bank-owned network until 2007.Most of the units merged to form Visa Inc, which went public in 2008, leaving Visa Europe as a separate entity.The deal brings all of Visa's networks under one roof again, cementing its lead over nearest-rival MasterCard Inc (MA.N).By value of payments, Visa Europe had a 52.2 percent share of the European card market in 2013. (bit.ly/1HVUjqe)Visa said it would pay 16.5 billion euros up front in cash and convertible preferred stock, with potential for an additional payment of up to 4.7 billion euros based on revenue targets four years after the deal closes.More than 3,000 companies stand to profit from the deal.Barclays Plc (BARC.L), the most active bank in the Visa Europe network, is likely to be the biggest winner, Bernstein analyst Chirantan Barua wrote in a note. Barclays said in a statement that it expected an after-tax profit of about 400 million pounds ($619 million) next year when the deal closes.The bank could receive up to 1.2 billion euros in total, a person familiar with the matter said.Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY.L) said it expected a pretax gain of about 300 million pounds when the deal closes, while payment services provider Worldpay Group Plc (WPG.L) said it expected about 1.25 billion euros from the deal, including 592 million euros when it closes.Visa said it was targeting savings of $200 million from the deal in 2020, a 30 percent reduction from the current run rate. Much of the savings will come from integration of technology. HIGH PRICE Currently, Visa Europe charges the banks - its owners - less than MasterCard. That is likely to change, analysts said.

285,"   By Liana B. Baker  Visa Inc is forecasting 400,000 to 500,000 international visitors to Rio de Janeiro in August, a projection one of its top marketing executives called ""reassuring"" given economic and health issues swirling around the August games in Brazil. Chris Curtin, Visa's chief brand and innovation marketing officer, said those figures are based on an ""enormous amount of transactions"" in Visa's network in the region ranging from hotel nights, entertainment to transportation, as well as third-party historical data.Visa's projections are higher than a 2014 prediction from Brazil's tourism agency of 380,000 foreign visitors, while they are lower than the 590,000 foreign visitors who went to the United Kingdom for the last summer Olympics in 2012, according to UK government statistics. The Rio Games run from Aug. 5-21 this year. Brazil was awarded the Olympics in 2009 when it was enjoying a period of strong economic growth, but has since fallen into its worst recession in decades, dragged down by a collapse in commodity prices.Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff could also be forced from office before the Olympics, after losing an impeachment vote which has paralyzed her government.  At the same time, the country is waging a battle against the Zika virus, which is linked to birth defects in newborns.It is the first time that Visa is projecting Olympic travel attendance. The company has a unique vantage point on such plans because, as a sponsor of the International Olympic Committee since 1986, it is the only form of payment accepted besides cash for Olympic tickets and travel packages. Its data, combined with historical attendance and spending, shows ""a lot of demand for getting to Brazil"" to participate in or watch the Olympics, Curtin said in an interview. About 45 percent of travelers will come from Latin America and the Caribbean, 30 percent from Europe and only 15 percent from North America, Visa predicts. U.S. travelers were the biggest spenders at the last summer Olympics, spending $91 million in London in 2012.Travel to Brazil will increase by 1.2 million travelers in 2016 compared with the average amount of tourists between 2010 and 2015.  Visa did not make a prediction of how much an average visitor to the games will spend. It said, however, that travelers to the London 2012 Olympic games spent an average of $1830, twice as much per visit as a typical tourist to the United Kingdom that year.

300,"   By Liana B. Baker  Visa Inc, one of the Olympics' top global sponsors, kicks off its global advertising campaign for the Summer Games on Sunday with no plans to cut back on its Olympic presence despite difficulties in host country Brazil. The U.S. payment provider said it has seen no significant cancellations in trips to Rio de Janeiro, either among its own team or Olympic ticket and travel package purchasers, over concerns of an outbreak of the Zika virus and political upheaval in Brazil. ""We are being very proactive about preparing our employees, guests and clients and customers who will be attending for eventualities that might occur, but we feel pretty good about it,"" Lynne Biggar, Visa's chief marketing and communications officer, said in an interview. ""We have not seen any different pattern of cancellation than we do in any Olympic games,"" she added. The company has a unique vantage point on travel plans because, as a sponsor of the International Olympic Committee since 1986, it provides the only form of payment accepted besides cash for official Olympic tickets and packages.Visa expects 400,000 to 500,000 visitors to attend the Rio Games, which run from Aug. 5-21, the first Olympics ever to be held in South America. Brazil was awarded the Olympics in 2009, when it was enjoying a period of strong economic growth, but has since fallen into its worst recession in decades. Congress has suspended President Dilma Rousseff while she faces an impeachment trial.

303,"   By Steve Slater  LONDON, June 22 (IFR) - Dozens of European banks will book hefty windfalls in the second quarter from the sale of their stakes in Visa Europe, after Visa Inc this week completed the purchase of its sister card payments firm.Barclays is set to be the biggest beneficiary due to the amount of trading on its Visa cards, booking a gain of about £396m now the sale has completed. The British bank will also receive shares in Visa and another cash payment in 2019 that could see it reap about 1.2bn from the sale, people familiar with the matter have previously said.Most other major European banks - including Lloyds, HSBC, Intesa Sanpaolo, Santander and Caixabank - will also get a second-quarter windfall of varying size depending on how active they are on the Visa network. That income will be timely, as bank profits are under pressure from sluggish economies and weak trading income.US card giant Visa agreed to buy Visa Europe for up to US$23.3bn in November, in a deal that unites the two arms of the world's largest payments network.The proceeds will be shared by more than 3,000 banks and payment firms that own the European network. Visa and Visa Europe were part of a global bank-owned network until 2007, when Visa Europe became a separate entity. It has more than 500m cards in issue and had a 52% share of the European card market in 2013.Under November's deal, Visa said it will pay 16.5bn up front in cash and convertible preferred stock, with potential for an additional payment of up to 4.7bn. Visa Europe's members have this week received shares in Visa as well as the cash payment, and will get another cash payment on the third anniversary of closing, the size of which will depend on future net revenue for the business.UK banks could receive about 40% of the proceeds, because of the popularity of the Visa network in Britain, people have previously estimated. Much of the remaining activity is in France, Spain and Italy.Some banks have this week disclosed the second-quarter profit boost they will get, although some said most of the capital benefit was booked in 2015 results when the deal was struck. Italy's Intesa Sanpaolo said the deal will result in a second-quarter net capital gain of around 150m and Spain's Caixabank said it expected a gain of 115m.Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International said it will get 97m from the initial cash payment and Britain's Co-operative Bank said it will recognise a gain of £62m in its half-year results.Lloyds has previously said it expected a pretax gain of about £300m from the upfront cash payment when the deal closed.Payment services provider Worldpay Group said the sale of its 5.9% interest in Visa Europe will bring in 1.25bn. That consists of an upfront cash payment of 592m, 374m in Visa shares and a future payment of up to 283m.

Wal-Mart has taken away the consumer's right to choose which payment form they want to use, Stephanie Ericksen, Visa's vice president of global risk products, told Reuters last month.

312,"  NEW YORK, June 30 A federal appeals court on Thursday threw out a $7.25 billion antitrust settlement among Visa Inc, MasterCard Inc and millions of retailers over credit card fees.The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said some of the retailers were inadequately represented in the case. It also decertified the case as a class action.  The settlement was intended to resolve nearly a decade of litigation concerning whether Visa and MasterCard improperly fixed fees that merchants were charged when customers used credit or debit cards.

313,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A federal appeals court on Thursday threw out a $7.25 billion antitrust settlement reached by Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N) with millions of retailers that accused the card networks of improperly fixing credit and debit card fees.The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said the accord was unfair to retailers that stood to receive no payments and, in the court's view, little or no benefit at all. It also decertified the case as a class action.""This is not a settlement; it is a confiscation,"" wrote Circuit Judge Pierre Leval, a member of the three-judge panel that unanimously struck down the settlement.The deal had been the largest all-cash U.S. antitrust settlement, though its value shrank to about $5.7 billion after roughly 8,000 retailers ""opted out.""Thursday's decision is a blow to the credit card industry, which hoped the settlement would end a decade of litigation brought on behalf of about 12 million retailers against Visa, MasterCard and banks that issue their cards.It was intended to resolve claims that merchants were overcharged on interchange fees, or swipe fees, when shoppers used credit or debit cards, and were barred from directing customers toward cheaper means of payment.The settlement may now need to be renegotiated, or the case could go to trial.""Swipe fees are an improper and unnecessary hidden tax on consumers,"" said Jeffrey Shinder, a Constantine Cannon partner representing Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O), Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and other opponents of the accord. ""The structure of swipe fees is back on the table.""Visa spokeswoman Connie Kim said the Foster City, California-based company is reviewing the decision.MasterCard spokesman Seth Eisen said the company, based in Purchase, New York, is disappointed in the decision and will review its next steps. Visa shares closed down $2.57, or 3.3 percent, at $74.17. MasterCard fell $4.07, or 4.4 percent, to $88.06. The S&P 500 Information Technology Index .SPLRCT, which includes both, rose 1.1 percent.RETHINKING BEHAVIOR U.S. District Judge John Gleeson in Brooklyn had approved the settlement in December 2013, saying it offered ""significant"" damages and meaningful protections against future harm.Many retailers and trade groups nevertheless objected. Some said the payout should have been higher. Others said the accord would have made it too hard to sue Visa and MasterCard. Wal-Mart, in a statement, said the settlement would also have ""stifled innovation around new payments technologies and left consumers facing continually increasing hidden swipe fees.""Card issuers American Express Co (AXP.N) and Discover Financial Services (DFS.N) also objected to the settlement.The National Retail Federation said retailers pay roughly $60 billion annually in swipe fees, which typically average around 2 percent.Mallory Duncan, the group's general counsel, told Reuters in an interview that the settlement would have ""forever"" shielded card networks from a variety of litigation, while giving retailers ""at best"" three cents on the dollar in damages.Thursday's decision ""will give real incentives to the card networks to rethink their anti-competitive behavior,"" he said. Paul Clement, who led the appeal for retailers supporting the accord, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Card-issuing banks would have funded much of the settlement. JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) had estimated they were responsible for roughly one-fifth and one-tenth, respectively, of a payout. Both declined to comment.The settlement had called for retailers that accepted Visa or MasterCard from January 2004 to November 2012 to share in as much as $7.25 billion, with the ability to opt out.Retailers that accepted the cards from then on, meanwhile, were to get injunctive relief in the form of rule changes, expiring in July 2021, and could not opt out.Writing for the appeals court, Circuit Judge Dennis Jacobs said these groups' divergent interests meant they should not have been represented by the same law firms, which were awarded $544.8 million of fees.While making clear he did not question the firms' motives, Jacobs said the conflict ""sapped"" their incentive to zealously represent the retailers obtaining injunctive relief, and led to terms that benefited other retailers at their expense.The case will return to the Brooklyn federal court, where it will be overseen by U.S. District Judge Margo Brodie.The case is In Re: Payment Card Interchange Fee and MerchantDiscount Antitrust Litigation, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 12-4671.

Baker  Visa Inc, operator of the world's largest payments network, said on Wednesday it had signed sponsorship deals with all 10 members of the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) refugee team, essentially becoming their first corporate sponsor.The IOC introduced its inaugural refugee team in June to draw global attention to the plight of refugees. The athletes, six men and four women will compete in the sports of swimming, judo and athletics and march with the Olympic flag just before host Brazil at the opening ceremony Aug. 5.The team includes five athletes from South Sudan, two from Syria, two from Democratic Republic of Congo and one from Ethiopia. All are required to have official refugee status, according to the United Nations.Chris Curtin, Visa's chief marketing innovation and brand officer, said sponsoring refugee athletes ties into the concept of acceptance that is one of the creative threads behind the company's Olympic campaign, and also an idea consumers associate with credit cards.The company can use the refugees in their marketing campaigns if the IOC approves it. The IOC said in a statement that it helped facilitate Visa's support of the refugee athletes in Rio and that it is ""delighted"" that the athletes have the company as a sponsor.  Some advocates for refugees have questioned whether it is opportunistic for companies to use refugees in advertising campaigns.The value of Visa's deals with refugee athletes, which it brokered directly with them with the help of the IOC, was not disclosed.

The result included a 662 percent after tax gain on the sale of VISA Europe shares.

""Consumers will be able to choose how they pay and our card members will not be discriminated against at the point of sale,"" spokeswoman Marina Norville said.Lawyers for dozens of retailers, such as Target Corp (TGT.N) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), had argued that voiding American Express' anti-steering rules would encourage competition and drive prices they pay to card networks lower. INJUNCTION In his ruling, Garaufis had said the NDPs enabled American Express to wrongfully exploit its 26.4 percent share of purchase volume in the U.S. credit and charge card market.The judge later imposed an injunction that also allowed merchants to offer discounts, rebates and other incentives to customers for using other cards with lower fees.But in December, after American Express said the injunction would cause irreparable harm, the appeals court temporarily lifted that injunction, enabling the company to enforce its rules during the appeal.Monday's decision means it can continue doing so.Visa and MasterCard together recently had close to 1.2 billion cards in the United States.

American Express had 47 million as of June 30, down about 15 percent from 55.3 million a year earlier.The case is U.S. et al v. American Express Co et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 15-1672.

359,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The U.S. government on Thursday asked a federal appeals court to reconsider a recent antitrust decision allowing American Express Co (AXP.N) to stop merchants from encouraging customers to use rival cards that charge lower fees.In its Sept. 26 decision, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York reversed a lower court ruling that had struck down AmEx's ""anti-steering"" rules.At issue are the more than $50 billion of fees that merchants pay annually to process transactions.These fees are largely hidden from customers, but can be passed along to them through higher prices.The appeals court said AmEx can block merchants that accept its cards from steering customers to cheaper cards from Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N), even if the move saved them money. But in Thursday's filing, the U.S. Department of Justice said the court erred by focusing on how AmEx's policy affected customers and merchants, rather than merchants alone.The department also said it should not have had to show at the outset that the policy did more harm than good, and that instead AmEx must show how its policy promotes competition.""It is not for AmEx to decide on behalf of the entire market to eliminate merchant-side price competition, forcing all retail customers to subsidize rewards for AmEx's affluent cardholders,"" the Justice Department said. AmEx spokesman Andrew Johnson in a statement said the government's claims lack merit, and that ""if asked to do so by the court, we will oppose the DOJ's petition vigorously.""The New York-based company accounted for about 26.4 percent of U.S. credit and charge card purchase volume in 2013.Visa and MasterCard settled similar lawsuits in 2011 by agreeing to change their rules. Thursday's filing seeks reconsideration of the Sept. 26 decision by the original three-judge appeals court panel, or by the court's 11 active judges in an ""en banc"" review.The 2nd Circuit rarely grants such requests, and holds en banc hearings at a rate of roughly one every other year.The case is U.S. et al v. American Express Co et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 15-1672.

362,"   By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday gave the green light to class action lawsuits by consumers accusing Visa Inc (V.N), Mastercard Inc (MA.N) and several U.S. banks of conspiring to inflate the prices of ATM access fees in violation of antitrust law.The justices dismissed two related cases they earlier had agreed to hear in which the companies had sought to overturn an August 2015 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that had revived the three lawsuits.The justices had been scheduled to hear oral arguments on Dec. 7. In the order, the court said the cases were dismissed because the companies had changed their legal arguments after the justices agreed to hear the dispute. The court frowns upon such practices.The appeals court ruled that a district court had erred when it concluded that consumers had no legal standing to sue and had not adequately alleged antitrust violations. It remanded the three consolidated lawsuits to the district court for further proceedings.  The lawsuits accused Visa and MasterCard of adopting rules protecting themselves from competition with lower-cost ATM networks. The rules blocked ATM operators from charging less when ATM transactions were processed by networks competing with Visa and Mastercard, the lawsuits said.The rules also benefited major banks, which were equity shareholders of Visa and Mastercard, the lawsuits said. The lawsuits seek damages for consumers and ATM operators for violations of antitrust law.Also named as defendants in the lawsuits were Bank of America Corp(BAC.N), JPMorgan Chase & Co(JPM.N) and Wells Fargo & Co(WFC.N). The lawsuits said that the banks controlled Visa and MasterCard and set higher ATM charges before the credit card companies went public in 2008 and 2006, respectively.

365,"   By Alison Frankel  I doubt that when history books survey the shocking events of November 2016, they will spare many words for the U.S. Supreme Court’s announcement late Thursday that it had dismissed a pair of cases involving credit card networks and ATM fees ranks. But for lawyers in the elite ranks of the Supreme Court bar, the justices’ order – which said that Visa, MasterCard and bank members of credit card networks had changed their argument after persuading the court to take their case -- created a considerable stir in the elite appellate bar, not least because counsel of record for Visa and the other petitioners is Neal Katyal of Hogan Lovells, a former acting U.S. solicitor general and extremely accomplished Supreme Court litigator.So what happened?I should say right here that I don’t know for sure. Katyal didn’t respond to my email requesting comment and the lawyers I spoke with didn’t want to go on the record, for the most part. But those conversations and filings in the Supreme Court cases – there were two parallel proceedings with different respondents – suggest that the credit card companies briefed their petitions for Supreme Court review on quite narrow grounds that, even if they prevailed, wouldn’t be especially useful to them in the future. Once they reached the Supreme Court, though, they asserted a bolder argument that, had they won it, would have given their industry broad antitrust protection.Strategically, in other words, the credit card companies may have been willing to risk the rare indignity of having their cases tossed for the chance of winning a decision worth potentially billions of dollars. The justices don’t seem to have appreciated that gamesmanship.The underlying litigation alleged that Visa and MasterCard - which at the time operated as associations of member banks - and their member banks violated the Sherman Act by jacking up the fees for independent ATMs to access their networks. A trial judge in Washington, D.C., dismissed the cases, finding, among other things, that the plaintiffs hadn’t shown restraint of trade. The District of Columbia U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals revived the suits in 2015. An array of distinguished firms represented Visa, MasterCard and the banks in their petition for certiorari: Arnold & Porter; Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom, Morrison & Foerster, Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler and Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison. Their argument was that the D.C. Circuit split with the 9th Circuit in a nearly identical case (and more broadly with other federal circuits) when it held that mere membership in and adherence to the rules of the Visa and MasterCard networks was sufficient to allege members engaged in an antitrust conspiracy. The cert petitions defined the question presented as: “Whether allegations that members of a business association agreed to adhere to the association's rules and possess governance rights in the association, without more, are sufficient to plead the element of conspiracy in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.”Despite opposition from the consumers and from the independent ATM operators that had brought the underlying suits – which argued that the D.C. Circuit didn’t look only at membership in the Visa and MasterCard associations but at additional evidence of collusion as well – the justices agreed to take the cases to hear the question the credit card companies presented. Between the cert grant on June 28 and the opening merits brief, Visa, MasterCard and the banks changed their counsel of record, bringing in Katyal of Hogan Lovells. The credit card companies and banks also changed their argument, though they didn’t say so. Instead of asserting that membership in a business association is not sufficient evidence of members participating in antitrust conspiracy, Katyal made the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2010 decision in American Needle v. National Football League the centerpiece of his merits brief. American Needle, you’ll recall, involved an antitrust challenge to NFL teams for granting apparel licenses as a group.Though the NFL lost, the credit card companies’ merits brief asserted that the Supreme Court considered the teams a single entity – a sort of joint marketing venture. Each credit card company and its network of banks, the merits brief said, should be viewed not as horizontal competitors engaged in a conspiracy to fix ATM access fees but as a single network. “The D.C. Circuit thought respondents' circumstantial allegations regarding the banks' role in each network's governance were enough” to let the case proceed, the brief said, citing American Needle. “But every joint venture involves cooperation between legally distinct entities, often with respect to how the venture will be run. And nothing in the complaints suggests the rules were the product of each network's member banks' ‘act[ing] on interests separate from those of' their network.”Now it’s important to remember that Visa and MasterCard are no longer membership associations – the subject of the question presented in the cert petition. But both still operate in networks with the banks that offer their cards. And both face big-dollar claims that they and their bank members collude on fees. If the Supreme Court were to agree with the Visa and MasterCard reframing of their networks’ activities in the ATM fee case, wrote Thomas Goldstein of Goldstein & Russell in a response brief for the independent ATM operators, “it is hard to see how competitors could ever be subject to suit under Section 1 for the activities of a joint venture.” Goldstein’s brief pointed out that Visa and the other petitioners had not even mentioned American Needle or joint ventures when they asked the Supreme Court for review. Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, which represents the consumer respondents, said the same it its brief. So did the Justice Department in its filing in support of the respondents. All of the briefs urged the justices not to allow Visa and MasterCard to game the Supreme Court.“Departing from this court's settled practice of deciding only the Question Presented would be particularly improvident in this case,” Goldstein wrote. “The issue petitioners belatedly raise is central to an array of Section 1 claims against petitioners in other suits that have not yet been decided in the lower courts. Those cases involve a wide variety of restraints that have not even been described to this court, much less briefed in a manner that could permit a reasoned decision on such important matters. … Indeed, petitioners' goal in pivoting their argument in this court so radically is almost certainly to secure such sweeping antitrust immunity, short-circuiting the other suits they now face.”The justices gave Visa, MasterCard and their counsel a chance to respond, but in briefs filed earlier this week, Katyal mostly reargued the credit card companies’ position on antitrust and joint ventures, though he did point out that the consumer opposition to certiorari raised American Needle. The credit card companies’ joint venture assertions, the response brief said, fall squarely within the question that was presented in the cert petition.Obviously, the justices disagreed, since they dismissed the cases the day after the response briefs were filed. The Supreme Court apparently had an open mind about whether to allow the credit card companies to expand their argument as recently as Nov. 14, when it granted the solicitor general’s office permission to participate in the scheduled Dec. 7 oral argument. It seems that the response briefs must have resolved any doubts, to the detriment of the credit card companies.",2016-11-19,V,"Fri Nov 18, 2016 | 8:34pm EST","SCOTUS dismissal of ATM fees case: Visa, MasterCard swung for a home run, called out on strikes",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-otc-visa-idUSKBN13E03X?type=companyNews
