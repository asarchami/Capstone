0,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, April 15 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a credit rating of 'BBB+'  to the following notes issued by Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership (Ventas  Realty), a subsidiary of Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR): --$300 million aggregate principal amount of 1.25% senior unsecured notes due  2017; --$400 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% senior unsecured notes due  2024. The notes are guaranteed by Ventas, Inc. on a senior unsecured basis. The 2017 notes were issued at 99.815% of par value to yield 1.313% or 55 basis  points over the benchmark rate, and the 2024 notes were issued at 99.304% of par  value to yield 3.834% or 120 basis points over the benchmark rate. Ventas  expects to use the net proceeds to repay indebtedness outstanding under its  unsecured revolving credit facility and for working capital and other general  corporate purposes, including funding future acquisitions or investments, if  any. Fitch currently rates Ventas, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, Ventas)  as follows: --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'BBB+'; --$2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility 'BBB+'; --$1 billion senior unsecured term loans 'BBB+'; --$5.9 billion senior unsecured notes 'BBB+'. Nationwide Health Properties, LLC (NHP) --IDR 'BBB+'; --$234.4 million senior unsecured notes 'BBB+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The 'BBB+' IDR reflects the balanced cash flow from the company's healthcare  property portfolio (predominantly seniors housing, nursing facility and medical  office assets) that includes a diversified roster of operators and managers.  Credit strengths include strong access to capital and liquidity, and a  credit-focused but opportunistic management team that continues to seek growth  in the fragmented healthcare real estate market. Fixed charge coverage has been  and is expected to remain strong for the 'BBB+' rating. These positive elements are balanced by leverage that has been at the high end  for a healthcare REIT rated 'BBB+' (though appropriate for the rating on a  normalized basis) and the limited operational history for the company's REIT  Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007 (RIDEA) investments when  compared with other commercial real estate asset classes. RIDEA investments  represented 27% of the company's 4Q2013 NOI. Demographics Benefit Portfolio The company's seniors housing operating assets are located in markets with older  populations, as well as higher household incomes and net worth when compared  with the U.S. markets at large. The medical office building (MOB) platform  includes the company's Lillibridge subsidiary and is 96% on-campus or affiliated  across over 70 health systems, providing cash flow stability. Ventas owns nearly 1,500 properties in 46 states, the District of Columbia and  two Canadian provinces. The company's largest states by annualized NOI are  currently California at 14%, Texas at 8%, New York at 7%, and Illinois, Florida  and Massachusetts all at 5%, with no other state exceeding 5% of NOI. Diversified Operator/Manager Platform The company's operator/manager roster concentration continues to diminish via  acquisitions; top operators and managers as of Dec. 31, 2013 were Atria Senior  Living, Inc. at 15% of NOI, Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE: KND) at 13%, Sunrise  Senior Living, Inc. at 11%, and Brookdale Senior Living Inc. (NYSE: BKD) at 9%,  with no other tenant/operator exceeding 4% of NOI. As of Dec. 31, 2013, operating seniors housing, triple-net seniors housing,  skilled nursing, medical office and hospitals represented 27%, 27%, 20%, 17% and  7% of NOI, respectively. EBITDARM coverage ratios for the company's triple-net seniors housing, skilled  nursing and hospital segments were 1.3x, 1.7x and 2.3x, respectively in 3Q'13  (tenant coverage is reported with a one quarter lag). Blended EBITDARM coverage  of 1.6x indicates a sufficient earnings cushion in excess of rent payments to  Ventas. Kindred Master Lease Renewal Risk Ventas renewed, sold or transitioned to new operators on or before July 1, 2013  all 89 healthcare assets whose leases with Kindred expired during 2Q'13. In  September 2013, Ventas entered into agreements with Kindred to extend the leases  with respect to 48 of the 108 properties comprising the 2015 renewal assets  ($138 million of annual rent), including 26 skilled nursing facilities and 22  long-term acute care hospitals. These transactions increased rents by $15  million over current annual base rent.  Ventas launched a project to re-lease the remaining 60 skilled nursing  facilities included in the 2015 renewal assets. However, the outcome of the  re-leasing project could have a negative impact on cash flow stability. Strong Access to Capital and Liquidity Over the past 12 months, Ventas has been active in the unsecured bond market,  unsecured term loan and common equity markets, including via an at-the-market  equity offering program. In December 2013, the company entered into a new $3  billion unsecured credit facility that replaced its previous $2 billion  unsecured revolving credit facility, as well as three unsecured term loans. The  new unsecured credit facility is comprised of a $2 billion revolving credit  facility initially priced at LIBOR plus 1%, and a $200 million four-year term  loan and an $800 million five-year term loan, each initially priced at LIBOR  plus 1.05%. Liquidity coverage, defined as liquidity sources divided by uses, is strong at  2.5x for the period Jan. 1, 2014 through Dec. 31, 2015. Liquidity sources  include unrestricted cash and availability under the unsecured revolving credit  facility pro forma for the 2017 and 2024 notes offering, and projected retained  cash flows from operating activities after dividends. Liquidity uses include pro  rata debt maturities, projected recurring capital expenditures, and projected  development expenditures. Assuming an 80% refinance rate on 2014 - 2015 secured  debt maturities, liquidity coverage is 2.8x. Near-term debt maturities were  minimal as of Dec. 31, 2013, with 1.5% of debt maturing in 2014, followed by  10.4% in 2015, and 10.7% in 2016.  Fitch calculates that the company's dividends and distributions represented  72.7% of normalized FFO adjusted for capital expenditures and straight-line rent  in 2013, which indicates good retained liquidity generated from operating cash  flow.  Ventas has good contingent liquidity with unencumbered assets (annualized  unencumbered NOI divided by a stressed 8.5% capitalization rate) covering net  unsecured debt by 2.3x as of Dec. 31, 2013. In addition, the covenants in the  company's debt agreements do not restrict financial flexibility. Normalized Leverage Appropriate for 'BBB+' As of Dec. 31, 2013, net debt to fourth-quarter 2013 annualized recurring  operating EBITDA was 5.5x (5.8x for full year 2013), compared with 5.7x in  FY2012 and 6.0x in FY2011. Leverage was high for the 'BBB+' rating at the end of  both 2012 and 2011 due to the timing of the Cogdell Spencer, NHP and Atria  acquisitions. Fitch anticipates that leverage will remain in the low-to-mid 5x range over the  next 12 to 24 months, due to expectations of ongoing balanced access to  unsecured debt and equity markets coupled with low-single digit same-store NOI  growth. Same-store cash NOI grew by 5% in 2013 (3.4% excluding a $20 million  rent prepayment), following growth of 4.4% in 2012, 2.6% in 2011, 6% in 2010 and  3.4% in 2009. In a stress case not anticipated by Fitch in which operational  volatility results in flat same-store NOI, leverage would sustain in the high-5x  range, which would be weak for a 'BBB+' rating. Credit-Focused but Opportunistic Management Ventas has a track record of being a flexible allocator of capital across  various healthcare real estate asset classes and management has remained attuned  to managing credit metrics through various acquisitions. The company completed  $1.9 billion of investments in 2013, including development and redevelopment  projects. This included $853 million of triple-net leased assets, $772 million  of seniors housing operating assets managed by Atria and $181 million of medical  office buildings. Notably, multiple senior managers have been with the company  since 2002, providing stability through real estate and capital market cycles. Limited Government Reimbursement Risk The company's payor sources are 70% private pay by 2013 NOI. As a result, Fitch  does not expect that rules by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  (CMS) for fiscal year 2014 will have a material negative impact on the company's  portfolio. Prospective payment system (PPS) payment growth rates for Medicare in  skilled nursing facilities are 1.3% for FY2014 (reflecting a 2.3% increase in  the market basket index, less a 0.5% forecast error adjustment and a 0.5%  productivity adjustment mandated by the Affordable Care Act) following 1.8% in  FY2013 and for long-term acute care hospitals are 1.3% for FY2014 following 1.7%  in FY2013.  Growing But Still Small Development  The company's development pipeline had a total estimated cost of $232.2 million  as of June 30, 2013. Cost-to-complete represented only $200.1 million or 0.9% of  gross asset value and 0.8% of enterprise value as of Dec. 31, 2013.  Historically, Ventas has not been an active developer. Strong Fixed-Charge Coverage Despite CapEx Despite increased capital expenditures related to the seniors housing operating  portfolio, fixed-charge coverage was strong for the rating at 4.1x for 4Q'13 pro  forma (4.3x for full-year 2013), compared with 4.4x in 2012 and 3.8x in 2011.  Fitch defines fixed-charge coverage as recurring operating EBITDA less recurring  capital expenditures less straight-line rent adjustments divided by total  interest incurred. Fitch anticipates that low single-digit same store NOI growth will result in  coverage sustaining in the mid-4x range over the next 12 to 24 months, which is  strong for a 'BBB+' rating. In a stress case not anticipated by Fitch in which  operational volatility results in same-store NOI declines, coverage would fall  just below 4x, which would remain commensurate with a 'BBB+' rating. Parent-Subsidiary Linkage Based on Fitch's criteria report, 'Parent and Subsidiary Rating Linkage,' dated  Aug. 5, 2013, the Ventas merger with NHP in July 2011 resulted in a  parent-subsidiary relationship whereby NHP is a wholly owned subsidiary of  Ventas, Inc. Prior to the merger, NHP previously had stronger standalone credit  metrics including lower leverage and higher fixed-charge coverage. Given the  stronger subsidiary credit profile, combined with strong legal and operating  ties (e.g. common management and a centralized treasury), the IDRs of Ventas and  NHP are linked and are expected to remain the same going forward. The IDRs are  based on the financial metrics and credit profile of the consolidated entity. Stable Outlook The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's base case that leverage will remain around  5x, coverage will sustain around 4x, and liquidity will remain solid. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may result in positive momentum on the ratings and/or  Outlook: --A continued reduction in tenant/operator concentration; --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 4.0x (pro forma  coverage is 4.1x); --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.0x (4Q'13 leverage is  5.5x); --Fitch's expectation of unencumbered asset coverage of unsecured debt (UA/UD)  at a stressed 8.5% capitalization rate sustaining above 4.0x (this ratio was  2.3x at year-end 2013). The following factors may result in negative momentum on the ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining below 3.0x; --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 5.5x; --Fitch's expectation of UA/UD sustaining below 3.0x; --The company sustaining a liquidity coverage ratio below 1.0x.

4,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, June 03 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings for Ventas,  Inc. (NYSE: VTR or Ventas) as detailed below. The affirmation follows  announcements by Ventas that it agreed to acquire American Realty Capital  Healthcare Trust, Inc. (NASDAQ: HCT or ARC Healthcare) in a stock and cash  transaction valued at $2.6 billion and that Ventas will acquire 29 independent  living seniors housing communities located in Canada from Holiday Retirement to  be managed by Atria Senior Living in a separate transaction for CAD $980  million.  Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings as follows: Ventas, Inc. --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB+'; --$2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility at 'BBB+'; --$1 billion senior unsecured term loans at 'BBB+'; --$5.9 billion senior unsecured notes at 'BBB+'. Nationwide Health Properties, LLC (NHP) --IDR at 'BBB+'; --$234.4 million senior unsecured notes at 'BBB+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating affirmation takes into account that the transactions are credit  neutral and VTR's credit profile remains consistent with the 'BBB+' rating.  Credit strengths include that these transactions augment an already  well-diversified healthcare real estate portfolio and that to-be-acquired  seniors housing operating assets are located in areas with strong demographics.  The transactions will also increase the percentage of VTR's net operating income  derived from private pay sources, decrease manager/operator concentration and  slightly improve fixed-charge coverage.  These strengths are offset by an expected increase in leverage and near-term  weakening of liquidity prior to long-term debt incurrence. The company's strong  access to capital, low adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) payout ratio and  solid unencumbered asset coverage ratios mitigate liquidity risk. Strategically Consistent Transactions Augment Diversification As of March 31, 2014 and pro forma for the ARC Healthcare and Holiday Retirement  transactions, seniors housing operating assets that utilize RIDEA (REIT  Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act)-compliant structures will  comprise 30% of net operating income (NOI) compared with 28% previously. Seniors  housing triple net leased assets will comprise 24% of NOI compared with 26%  previously. Skilled nursing facility and medical office building NOI will each  make up 18% of NOI compared with 19% and 16%, respectively, in 1Q2014.  Property  type diversification has led to a stable stream of cash flows over the company's  history and continues to contribute strong SSNOI growth, which supports  operating performance through the cycle. However, the terms of the transactions  suggest rich portfolio valuation (the combined unlevered capitalization rate for  the ARC Healthcare and Holiday Retirement transactions is 6%), resulting in less  clarity surrounding VTR's growth prospects.  NOI derived from private pay sources will increase slightly to 75% pro forma  compared with 74% in 1Q2014, incrementally reducing exposure to risks related to  government reimbursement. Private pay revenue sources comprise 82% of ARC  Healthcare revenues while the Holiday Retirement communities to be managed by  Atria Senior Living are all private pay.  Strong portfolio demographics (i.e., median household income, population and  related growth for the 75+ year old cohort) for ARC Healthcare and Holiday  Retirement seniors housing operating assets should support cash flow growth  going forward. In addition, of the 143 ARC Healthcare assets, 78 are medical  office buildings that are over 97% occupied and that are 77% on campus or  health-system affiliated, compared with the Ventas MOB portfolio as of March 31,  2014, which had 91.2% occupancy and which was 96% on campus or health-system  affiliated. Manager/operator concentration will decline in the aggregate as a result of the  transactions. While Atria will comprise 18% of NOI compared with 17% previously,  Kindred and Sunrise will decline to 11% and 10% of NOI, respectively, pro forma  compared with 12% and 11%, respectively, in 1Q2014.  Increase in Leverage Fitch expects leverage will remain elevated for the current rating. As of March  31, 2014 pro forma for the ARC Healthcare and Holiday Retirement transactions,  net debt to recurring operating EBITDA increases to 6.0x assuming a 10% cash  election, up from 5.6x in 1Q2014. Leverage would be just below 6.0x assuming a  cash election less than 10%.  This is up slightly compared with 5.8x as of Dec.  31, 2013 and 5.7x as of Dec. 31, 2012. Leverage has been high due to the timing  of recent mergers and acquisitions including the Cogdell Spencer, NHP and Atria  acquisitions since 2011. Fitch anticipates that leverage will approach the mid-5x range over the next 12  to 24 months, due to expectations of ongoing balanced access to unsecured debt  and equity markets coupled with Fitch's projection of low-single digit  same-store NOI growth. In a stress case not anticipated by Fitch in which  operational volatility results in flat same-store NOI, leverage would sustain in  the high-5x range, which would be weak for the rating. Strong Fixed-Charge Coverage Fitch expects continued above-average SSNOI performance across the healthcare  REIT space for the remainder of 2014, partially driven by increasing exposure to  RIDEA assets, which are experiencing outsized growth relative to triple-net  assets, although the pace of growth is slowing. Ventas generated year-over-year  SS cash NOI growth of 3.7% in 1Q2014, including 4.1% for triple-net assets, 4.5%  for seniors housing operating assets and 1.6% for medical office buildings. For  full-year 2013, year-over-year same-store cash NOI grew by 5%, including 4.7%  for triple-net assets, 6% for seniors housing operating assets and 3.7% for  medical office buildings.  Fitch projects that the company's fixed charge coverage ratio is 4.0x in 1Q2014  pro forma assuming a 10% cash election, compared with 4.3x for the trailing 12  months ended March 31, 2014, 4.3x in 2013 and 4.4x in 2012. Fitch has assumed  combined NOI contribution of $227.5 million, offset by increased capital  expenditures related to seniors housing operating assets and increased interest  expense related to assumed ARC Healthcare mortgage debt and long-term unsecured  debt incurrence, including $300 million 1.25% senior unsecured notes and $400  million 3.75% senior unsecured notes issued in April 2014. Fixed-charge coverage  is strong for the 'BBB+' rating. Fitch defines fixed-charge coverage as  recurring operating EBITDA less recurring capital expenditures less  straight-line rent adjustments divided by total interest incurred. Fitch projects low single-digit same store NOI growth will result in coverage  sustaining in the low-to-mid-4x range over the next 12 to 24 months, which is  strong for a 'BBB+' rating. In a stress case not anticipated by Fitch in which  operational volatility results in same-store NOI declines, coverage would fall  just below 4x, which would remain commensurate with a 'BBB+' rating. Strong Access to Capital and Unencumbered Pool Mitigate Liquidity Risk Liquidity coverage, defined as liquidity sources divided by uses, was strong at  1.9x for the period April 1, 2014 through Dec. 31, 2015 pro forma for the April  bond offerings but declines to 0.7x pro forma for the ARC Healthcare and Holiday  Retirement transactions prior to long-term unsecured debt incurrence to fund the  transactions. Liquidity sources include unrestricted cash and availability under  the unsecured revolving credit facility pro forma for the 2017 and 2024 notes  offerings and ARC Healthcare and Holiday Retirement transactions, and projected  retained cash flows from operating activities after dividends. Liquidity uses  include pro rata debt maturities, projected recurring capital expenditures, and  projected development expenditures.  Assuming that the company incurs long-term unsecured debt prior to the closing  of the transaction, liquidity coverage would improve to 1.7x. This ratio would  improve to 2.6x assuming an 80% refinance rate on 2014 - 2015 secured debt  maturities. Over the past 12 months, Ventas has been active in the unsecured bond market,  unsecured term loan and common equity markets, including via an at-the-market  equity offering program. In December 2013, the company entered into a new $3  billion unsecured credit facility that replaced its previous $2 billion  unsecured revolving credit facility, as well as three unsecured term loans. The  new unsecured credit facility is comprised of a $2 billion revolving credit  facility initially priced at LIBOR plus 1%, and a $200 million four-year term  loan and an $800 million five-year term loan, each initially priced at LIBOR  plus 1.05%. Fitch calculates that the company's dividends and distributions represented  77.5% of normalized FFO adjusted for capital expenditures and straight-line rent  in 1Q2014, which indicates good retained liquidity generated from operating cash  flow. In addition, Ventas has good contingent liquidity with unencumbered assets  (annualized unencumbered NOI divided by a stressed 8.5% capitalization rate)  covering net unsecured debt by 2.1x as of March 31, 2014 pro forma, compared  with 2.3x previously. Parent-Subsidiary Linkage Based on Fitch's criteria report, ' Corporate Rating Methodology Including  Short-Term Ratings and Parent and Subsidiary Linkage,' dated May 28, 2014, the  Ventas merger with NHP in July 2011 resulted in a parent-subsidiary relationship  whereby NHP is a wholly owned subsidiary of Ventas, Inc. Prior to the merger,  NHP previously had stronger standalone credit metrics including lower leverage  and higher fixed-charge coverage. Given the stronger subsidiary credit profile,  combined with strong legal and operating ties (e.g. common management and a  centralized treasury), the IDRs of Ventas and NHP are linked and are expected to  remain the same going forward. The IDRs are based on the financial metrics and  credit profile of the consolidated entity. Stable Outlook The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's base case that fixed-charge coverage will  sustain around 4x which is strong for a 'BBB+' rated healthcare REIT, offset by  leverage sustaining around 5.5x, which is weak for a 'BBB+' rated healthcare  REIT. Fitch anticipates that the company will access the long-term unsecured  debt market prior to the closing of the ARC Healthcare and Holiday Retirement  transactions to improve liquidity.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may result in positive momentum on the ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 4.0x (pro forma  fixed-charge coverage is 4.0x); --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.0x (pro forma leverage is  6.0x); --Fitch's expectation of unencumbered asset coverage of unsecured debt (UA/UD)  at a stressed 8.5% capitalization rate sustaining above 4.0x (this ratio is 2.1x  pro forma). The following factors may result in negative momentum on the ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining below 3.0x; --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 5.5x;  --Fitch's expectation of UA/UD sustaining below 3.0x; --Fitch's expectation of liquidity coverage sustaining below 1.0x (this ratio is  0.7x pro forma but expected to improve to 1.7x pro forma for a long-term  unsecured debt incurred prior to the closing of the ARC Healthcare and Holiday  Retirement transactions).

",2014-06-03,VTR,"Tue Jun 3, 2014 | 3:44pm EDT","Fitch Affirms Ventas, Inc.'s IDR at 'BBB+' Upon ARC Healthcare & Holiday Retirement Transactions",http://www.reuters.com//article/fitch-affirms-ventas-incs-idr-at-bbb-upo-idUSFit70324520140603?type=companyNews
5,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, July 11 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'BBB+' Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) for Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR, Ventas or the company) with a Stable  Outlook following the company's announcement that it dismissed Ernst & Young  (E&Y) as its public accounting firm.  According to a Ventas SEC filing, the  dismissal is solely the result of an 'inappropriate personal relationship'  between an E&Y partner and VTR's former chief accounting officer and controller,  and does not relate to the fairness of the presentation of VTR's financial  statements or effectiveness of its internal controls.  Fitch does not expect the  announcement to result in a change in the company's long-term credit profile.   E&Y has withdrawn its 2012 and 2013 VTR audit reports.  In addition, the  company's SEC shelf registration is now ineffective since E&Y provided consent  under the previous shelf as VTR's auditor.  Consequently, VTR is unable to issue  public securities until its newly engaged auditor, KPMG LLP (KPMG), completes  its audit of the company's 2012 and 2013 financial statements.  Fitch expects  that KPMG's audit of these statements will be completed well in advance of the  previously announced acquisition of American Realty Capital Healthcare Trust,  Inc. (NASDAQ: HCT or ARC Healthcare), at which point the company would be able  to resume the issuance of public securities.   Fitch also expects the company to receive a waiver in the near term from its  unsecured line of credit lenders regarding a clause in the credit agreement that  requires the filing of financial statements by an independent auditor, which  will enable the company to draw on the line. Additionally, under the indenture  governing the Ventas bonds (but not bonds originally issued by Nationwide Health  Properties, Inc.), Ventas has 90 days to comply with certain events of default,  including the furnishing of financial statements audited by an independent  auditor. A remedy for failure to comply with such provisions is the bondholders'  right to receive additional interest of 0.25% until this event of default is  cured, but it does not trigger an acceleration of repayment of the bonds.  In June 2014, Fitch affirmed VTR's 'BBB+' IDR upon the announcements that the  company will acquire HCT in a stock and cash transaction valued at $2.6 billion  and will acquire 29 independent living seniors housing communities located in  Canada from Holiday Retirement to be managed by Atria Senior Living in a  separate transaction for CAD $980 million.  These transactions are expected to  close in the fourth quarter of 2014 (4Q'14) and 3Q'14, respectively.  Ventas  could fund the Holiday Retirement transaction with its unsecured revolving  credit facility following the receipt of a waiver.  A portion of the  consideration of the HCT merger is the issuance of Ventas common shares.   Therefore, if the KPMG audit is not completed in advance of the HCT merger  deadline and if VTR's shelf remains ineffective, VTR and HCT could agree to  extend the VTR-HCT merger close.  Under the merger agreement, the initial  deadline of the merger close is Jan. 31, 2015, however, under certain conditions  the close may be extended until May 31, 2015.  Fitch's expectation of liquidity coverage sustaining below 1.0x is one of  several sensitivities for negative pressure on the ratings.  This ratio is 0.7x  pro forma for the closing of the Holiday and HCT transactions, but expected to  improve to 1.7x pro forma for a long-term unsecured debt incurred prior to the  closing of these transactions.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation contemplates that the re-audit by KPMG will be completed well in  advance of the HCT merger close.  The 'BBB+' rating takes into account that the  HCT and Holiday Retirement transactions will augment an already well-diversified  healthcare real estate portfolio and that to-be-acquired seniors housing  operating assets are located in areas with strong demographics. The transactions  will also increase the percentage of VTR's net operating income derived from  private pay sources, decrease manager/operator concentration and slightly  improve fixed-charge coverage.  These strengths are offset by an expected increase in leverage and near-term  weakening of liquidity prior to long-term debt incurrence. The company's strong  access to capital, low adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) payout ratio and  solid unencumbered asset coverage ratios mitigate liquidity risk. Strategically Consistent Transactions Augment Diversification As of March 31, 2014 and pro forma for the ARC Healthcare and Holiday Retirement  transactions, seniors housing operating assets that utilize RIDEA (REIT  Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act)-compliant structures will  comprise 30% of net operating income (NOI) compared with 28% previously. Seniors  housing triple net leased assets will comprise 24% of NOI compared with 26%  previously. Skilled nursing facility and medical office building NOI will each  make up 18% of NOI compared with 19% and 16%, respectively, in 1Q'14. Property  type diversification has led to a stable stream of cash flows over the company's  history and continues to contribute strong same-store NOI (SSNOI) growth, which  supports operating performance through the cycle. However, the terms of the  transactions suggest rich portfolio valuation (the combined unlevered  capitalization rate for the ARC Healthcare and Holiday Retirement transactions  is 6%), resulting in less clarity surrounding VTR's growth prospects. NOI derived from private pay sources will increase slightly to 75% pro forma  compared with 74% in 1Q'14, incrementally reducing exposure to risks related to  government reimbursement. Private pay revenue sources comprise 82% of ARC  Healthcare revenues while the Holiday Retirement communities to be managed by  Atria Senior Living are all private pay. Strong portfolio demographics (i.e., median household income, population and  related growth for the 75+ year old cohort) for ARC Healthcare and Holiday  Retirement seniors housing operating assets should support cash flow growth  going forward. In addition, of the 143 ARC Healthcare assets, 78 are medical  office buildings that are over 97% occupied and that are 77% on campus or  health-system affiliated, compared with the Ventas MOB portfolio as of March 31,  2014, which had 91.2% occupancy and which was 96% on campus or health-system  affiliated. Manager/operator concentration will decline in the aggregate as a result of the  transactions. While Atria will comprise 18% of NOI compared with 17% previously,  Kindred and Sunrise will decline to 11% and 10% of NOI, respectively, pro forma  compared with 12% and 11%, respectively, in 1Q'14. Increase in Leverage Fitch expects leverage will remain elevated for the current rating. As of March  31, 2014, pro forma for the ARC Healthcare and Holiday Retirement transactions,  net debt to recurring operating EBITDA increases to 6.0x assuming a 10% cash  election, up from 5.6x in 1Q'14. Leverage would be just below 6.0x assuming a  cash election less than 10%. This is up slightly compared with 5.8x as of Dec.  31, 2013 and 5.7x as of Dec. 31, 2012. Leverage has been high due to the timing  of recent mergers and acquisitions including the Cogdell Spencer, NHP and Atria  acquisitions since 2011. Fitch anticipates that leverage will approach the mid-5x range over the next 12  to 24 months, due to expectations of ongoing balanced access to unsecured debt  and equity markets coupled with Fitch's projection of low-single digit  same-store NOI growth. In a stress case not anticipated by Fitch in which  operational volatility results in flat same-store NOI, leverage would sustain in  the high-5x range, which would be weak for the rating. Strong Fixed-Charge Coverage Fitch expects continued above-average SSNOI performance across the healthcare  REIT space for the remainder of 2014, partially driven by increasing exposure to  RIDEA assets, which are experiencing outsized growth relative to triple-net  assets, although the pace of growth is slowing. Ventas generated year-over-year  same-store cash NOI growth of 3.7% in 1Q'14, including 4.1% for triple-net  assets, 4.5% for seniors housing operating assets and 1.6% for medical office  buildings. For full-year 2013, year-over-year same-store cash NOI grew by 5%,  including 4.7% for triple-net assets, 6% for seniors housing operating assets  and 3.7% for medical office buildings. Fitch projects that the company's fixed charge coverage ratio is 4.0x in 1Q'14  pro forma assuming a 10% cash election, compared with 4.3x for the trailing 12  months ended March 31, 2014, 4.3x in 2013 and 4.4x in 2012. Fitch has assumed  combined NOI contribution of $227.5 million, offset by increased capital  expenditures related to seniors housing operating assets and increased interest  expense related to assumed ARC Healthcare mortgage debt and long-term unsecured  debt incurrence, including $300 million 1.25% senior unsecured notes and $400  million 3.75% senior unsecured notes issued in April 2014. Fixed-charge coverage  is strong for the 'BBB+' rating. Fitch defines fixed-charge coverage as  recurring operating EBITDA less recurring capital expenditures less  straight-line rent adjustments divided by total interest incurred. Fitch projects low single-digit SSNOI growth will result in coverage sustaining  in the low-to-mid-4x range over the next 12 to 24 months, which is strong for a  'BBB+' rating. In a stress case not anticipated by Fitch in which operational  volatility results in SSNOI declines, coverage would fall just below 4x, which  would remain commensurate with a 'BBB+' rating. Strong Access to Capital and Unencumbered Pool Mitigate Liquidity Risk Liquidity coverage, defined as liquidity sources divided by uses, was strong at  1.9x for the period April 1, 2014 through Dec. 31, 2015 pro forma for the April  bond offerings but declines to 0.7x pro forma for the ARC Healthcare and Holiday  Retirement transactions prior to long-term unsecured debt incurrence to fund the  transactions. Liquidity sources include unrestricted cash and availability under  the unsecured revolving credit facility pro forma for the 2017 and 2024 notes  offerings and ARC Healthcare and Holiday Retirement transactions, and projected  retained cash flows from operating activities after dividends. Liquidity uses  include pro rata debt maturities, projected recurring capital expenditures, and  projected development expenditures. Assuming that the company incurs long-term unsecured debt prior to the closing  of the transactions, liquidity coverage would improve to 1.7x. This ratio would  improve to 2.6x assuming an 80% refinance rate on 2014 - 2015 secured debt  maturities. Over the past 12 months, Ventas has been active in the unsecured bond market,  unsecured term loan and common equity markets, including via an at-the-market  equity offering program. In December 2013, the company entered into a new $3  billion unsecured credit facility that replaced its previous $2 billion  unsecured revolving credit facility, as well as three unsecured term loans. The  new unsecured credit facility is comprised of a $2 billion revolving credit  facility initially priced at LIBOR plus 1%, and a $200 million four-year term  loan and an $800 million five-year term loan, each initially priced at LIBOR  plus 1.05%. Fitch calculates that the company's dividends and distributions represented  77.5% of normalized funds from operations (FFO) adjusted for capital  expenditures and straight-line rent in 1Q'14, which indicates good retained  liquidity generated from operating cash flow. In addition, Ventas has good  contingent liquidity with unencumbered assets (annualized unencumbered NOI  divided by a stressed 8.5% capitalization rate) covering net unsecured debt by  2.1x as of March 31, 2014 pro forma, compared with 2.3x previously. Parent-Subsidiary Linkage Based on Fitch's criteria report, 'Corporate Rating Methodology Including  Short-Term Ratings and Parent and Subsidiary Linkage,' dated May 28, 2014, the  Ventas merger with NHP in July 2011 resulted in a parent-subsidiary relationship  whereby NHP is a wholly owned subsidiary of Ventas, Inc. Prior to the merger,  NHP previously had stronger standalone credit metrics including lower leverage  and higher fixed-charge coverage. Given the stronger subsidiary credit profile,  combined with strong legal and operating ties (e.g. common management and a  centralized treasury), the IDRs of Ventas and NHP are linked and are expected to  remain the same going forward. The IDRs are based on the financial metrics and  credit profile of the consolidated entity. Stable Outlook The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's base case that fixed-charge coverage will  sustain around 4x which is strong for a 'BBB+' rated healthcare REIT, offset by  leverage sustaining around 5.5x, which is weak for a 'BBB+' rated healthcare  REIT. The company currently has sufficient liquidity to fund the Holiday  Retirement transaction.  Fitch anticipates that KPMG will complete its re-audit  well in advance of the HCT merger and that the company's shelf registration will  become effective prior to the closing of the HCT merger to improve liquidity.   RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may result in positive momentum on the ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 4.0x (pro forma  fixed-charge coverage is 4.0x); --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.0x (pro forma leverage is  6.0x); --Fitch's expectation of unencumbered asset coverage of unsecured debt (UA/UD)  at a stressed 8.5% capitalization rate sustaining above 4.0x (this ratio is 2.1x  pro forma). The following factors may result in negative momentum on the ratings and/or  Outlook: --A prolonged re-audit process (Fitch anticipates that the re-audit will be  completed well in advance of the closing of the HCT merger); --A restatement of financial statements stemming from the re-audit or discovery  by KPMG of ineffective internal controls; --Fitch's expectation of liquidity coverage sustaining below 1.0x (this ratio is  0.7x pro forma but expected to improve to 1.7x pro forma for a long-term  unsecured debt incurred prior to the closing of the ARC Healthcare and Holiday  Retirement transactions); --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining below 3.0x; --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 5.5x;  --Fitch's expectation of UA/UD sustaining below 3.0x. Fitch has affirmed the ratings as follows: Ventas, Inc. --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB+'; --$2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility at 'BBB+'; --$1 billion senior unsecured term loans at 'BBB+'; --$5.9 billion senior unsecured notes at 'BBB+'. Nationwide Health Properties, LLC (NHP) --IDR at 'BBB+'; --$234.4 million senior unsecured notes at 'BBB+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

8,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, April 06 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed its ratings on Ventas,  Inc. (NYSE: VTR) and certain rated subsidiaries (collectively, Ventas) following  the company's announcements that it intends to spin-off 355 primarily post-acute  skilled nursing facility (SNF) properties operated by regional and local care  providers (spin-off) and also acquire the real estate of Ardent Health Services  for a net value of approximately $1.4 billion (Ardent transaction).  Fitch currently rates Ventas' long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'BBB+'. A  full list of ratings is shown at the bottom of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The spin-off and Ardent transactions will enable the company to focus primarily  on seniors housing and medical office buildings, and to a lesser extent  hospitals, which will lessen post-acute reimbursement risk by increasing the  percentage of NOI derived from private pay sources to 83% from 75% as of Dec.  31, 2014 pro forma for the American Realty Capital Healthcare Trust, Inc. (HCT)  transaction that closed in January 2015. Credit strengths incorporated into the  rating include strong fixed charge coverage, demonstrated access to multiple  sources of capital, adequate liquidity, and a deep management team.  The rating takes into account that the company has increased leverage over the  past several quarters due to acquisition timing and Fitch expects the company to  operate in the 5.6x to 5.8x range over the next two years. This range will be  appropriate for the 'BBB+' rating going forward due to the higher growth  potential of cash flows post-spin.  Credit concerns include the potential for higher volatility in operating cash  flows through the cycle given the company's RIDEA (REIT Investment  Diversification and Empowerment Act) structured investments and Fitch's broader  worries concerning the healthcare REIT sector's continued rapid growth and the  risk that companies in the sector may end up paying premium pricing for new  investments, given favorable equity valuations. SNF Spin-off and Ardent Collectively Lessen Reimbursement Risk; Continued  Diversification Skilled nursing has not been a large drain on Ventas' capital allocation, as the  portfolio is triple-net leased. However, the spin-off will allow Ventas to  sharpen its strategy while remaining diversified by property type, with a focus  on operators/managers with a national presence. As of Dec. 31, 2014 pro forma  for the HCT, spin-off and Ardent transactions, triple-net skilled nursing will  decline to 4% of net operating income (NOI) from 18%. Domestic seniors housing  operating assets that utilize RIDEA structures will comprise 28% of NOI compared  with 25% previously. Seniors housing triple net leased assets will increase to  26% of NOI from 23%, and medical office will increase to 20% of NOI from 18%. The seniors housing portfolio includes properties in high-barrier-to-entry  coastal markets that are experiencing favorable demographics including household  income, home values and senior population growth above U.S. averages, which  should continue to support cash flow growth.  Exposure to regional managers will be reduced pro forma for the spin-off and  Ardent transactions, a credit positive. The company's partners will include  Atria Senior Living, Brookdale Senior Living and Sunrise Senior Living on the  seniors housing side, Kindred Healthcare, Genesis Healthcare, HealthSouth and  Ensign Group on the post-acute SNF side, and Ventas will continue its  Lillibridge medical office business. The company's top operators/managers pro  forma are Atria at 19% of NOI, Sunrise, Kindred and Lillibridge, all at 10%, and  Brookdale at 9%.  EBITDAR Coverage on Ardent Portfolio Below Other Hospitals The Ardent transaction is a slight credit negative since initial rent coverage  levels indicate limited cushion against operator cash flow deterioration  relative to other hospitals. EBITDARM coverage of rents for the Ardent portfolio  is expected to be 2.9x initially. By contrast, Medical Properties Trust's (NYSE:  MPW) acute care hospital rent coverage ratios have been in the 4.5x-6.0x range  over the past several years. Ardent is currently owned by a private equity firm,  so it is unclear if the credit quality of the Ardent portfolio is superior to  that of MPW's hospital operators. VTR's entire triple net portfolio cash flow coverage was 1.6x as of Sept. 30,  2014, as this metric is reported in a one-quarter lag. Secular trends such as increased hospital expenditures and emergency room visits  should support the need for acute care hospitals. The Ardent hospital portfolio  includes acute care facilities in Amarillo, TX, Tulsa, OK and Albuquerque, NM,  regions in which these hospitals have a dominant market share. Ventas intends to  complete an OpCo/PropCo split of the portfolio and fund the acquisition in a  leverage neutral manner, net of a sale of the hospital operations business.  Following the OpCo/PropCo split, Ventas will enter into a long-term master lease  agreement with the OpCo.  Leverage Trending Higher As of Dec. 31, 2014 pro forma, net debt to recurring operating EBITDA is 5.8x,  compared to 6.1x for full year 2014 (5.9x in 4Q2014), and 5.8x in 2013. Leverage  increased in 2014 when compared with 5.6x as of Dec. 31, 2012 due to the timing  of recent transactions including the all-cash acquisition of 29 Canadian senior  living communities from Holiday Retirement in August 2014; net real estate  investments have trended in the $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion range over the past  several years. Fitch anticipates that leverage will remain between 5.6x and 5.8x through 2016,  due to expectations of ongoing balanced access to unsecured debt and equity  markets coupled with Fitch's projection of approximately 3% same-store NOI  growth. This leverage level remains appropriate for the 'BBB+' rating, but has  trended closer to the potential negative rating sensitivity leverage level of  6.0x. Strong Cash Flow Despite RIDEA Exposure Fitch views RIDEA structured seniors housing as having the potential for higher  volatility through the cycle than other healthcare property types. VTR's  portfolio exhibited average volatility and growth when compared to its two  closest peers (HCP, Inc., IDR of 'BBB+' with a Stable Outlook and Health Care  REIT, Inc., IDR of 'BBB+' with a Stable Outlook) from 2010 - 2014, although this  growth was achieved during a period of strong fundamentals.  The company's fixed charge coverage ratio is 4.2x in 4Q2014 pro forma for the  HCT, spin-off and Ardent transactions (4.3x for full year 2014), compared to  4.4x in 2013 and 4.5x in 2012. VTR's increased interest expense associated with  debt-financed acquisitions such as the Holiday Retirement portfolio in 2014,  offset by same-store NOI growth and NOI from development, led to this trend.  Fitch projects fixed-charge coverage in the low-to-mid 4.0x range over the next  several years, which is strong for a 'BBB+' rating. Fitch defines fixed charge  coverage as recurring operating EBITDA less straight-line rents and recurring  capital expenditures, divided by total cash interest incurred and preferred  dividends. Strong Access to Capital  The company continues to demonstrate strong access to multiple sources of  capital as evidenced by the January issuance of $600 million 3.5% 10-year notes,  $300 million 4.375% 30-year notes and C$250 million private placements due 2022.  Ventas recently established a $1 billion at-the-market (ATM) equity offering  program, following the initial $750 million program in 2013. In December 2014  and January 2015, Ventas issued $536 million under the initial ATM program.  In December 2013, the company entered into a new $3 billion unsecured credit  facility that replaced its previous $2.68 billion unsecured revolving credit  facility and unsecured term loans. The current unsecured credit facility is  comprised of a $2 billion revolver initially priced at LIBOR plus 1%, and a $200  million four-year term loan and an $800 million five-year term loan, each  initially priced at LIBOR plus 1.05%. VTR's revolver pricing is similar to HCN's  $2.5 billion unsecured revolver (LIBOR plus 1.05%) and HCP's $2 billion revolver  (LIBOR plus 0.925%). Adequate Liquidity  Liquidity coverage, calculated as liquidity sources divided by uses, is 1.3x for  the period Jan. 1, 2015 to Dec. 31, 2016. Sources of liquidity include  unrestricted cash, availability under the company's unsecured credit facility  pro forma for HCT, spin-off and Ardent transactions and January bond offerings,  and projected retained cash flows from operating activities after dividends.  Uses of liquidity include debt maturities and projected development costs,  including to-be-completed development.  The company's AFFO payout ratio was 73% in 2014, compared to 73.5% in 2013 and  72.6% in 2012. Based on the 2014 payout ratio, the company retains approximately  $325 million of operating cash flow annually; however Fitch expects this to be  approximately $180 million in 2015 due to the reduced cash flow from the  spin-off as well as the recent dividend increase, resulting in an AFFO payout  ratio closer to 85%. VTR's unencumbered assets (unencumbered NOI based on a  stressed 8.5% capitalization rate) divided by net unsecured debt is 2.2x pro  forma, which is adequate for the 'BBB+' rating. On the margin, the portfolio is  more leverageable as evidenced by the increased NOI contribution from seniors  housing pro forma, although offset by the addition of hospitals to the  unencumbered pool, which have limited leveragability.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions for Ventas in Fitch's base case include: --2% triple net revenue growth, 3.5% same store NOI growth on seniors housing  operating assets, and 3% same-store NOI growth in medical office buildings  through 2017; --G&A growth to maintain historical margins relative to total revenues;     --The SNF spin-off and Ardent transactions close in 3Q2015; --$2 billion in annual acquisitions in 2016-2017 funded with 50% equity and 50%  debt; --Debt repayment with the issuance of new unsecured bonds; --AFFO payout ratio of approximately 85%. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may result in positive momentum on the ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.5x (pro forma leverage is  5.8x); --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 4.0x (pro forma  fixed charge coverage is 4.2x); --Fitch's expectation of unencumbered asset coverage of unsecured debt (UA/UD)  at a stressed 8.5% capitalization rate sustaining above 4.0x (pro forma UA/UD is  2.2x). The following factors may result in negative momentum on the ratings and/or  Outlook: --Increased cash flow volatility through the cycle due to heightened RIDEA  exposure and/or material increase in RIDEA exposure; --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 6.0x; --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining below 3.0x; --Fitch's expectation of liquidity coverage sustaining below 1.0x. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Ventas, Inc. --IDR at 'BBB+'. Ventas Realty Limited Partnership and Ventas Capital Corporation --$2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility at 'BBB+'; --$990 million senior unsecured term loans at 'BBB+'; --$6.7 billion senior unsecured guaranteed notes at 'BBB+'. Ventas Canada Finance Limited --$774.5 million senior unsecured guaranteed notes at 'BBB+'. Nationwide Health Properties, LLC --IDR at 'BBB+'; --$309.8 million senior unsecured notes at 'BBB+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. NHP Ratings  Based on Fitch's criteria report, 'Corporate Rating Methodology Including  Short-Term Ratings and Parent and Subsidiary Linkage,' dated May 28, 2014, the  Ventas merger with Nationwide Health Properties, Inc. in July 2011 resulted in a  parent-subsidiary relationship whereby Nationwide Health Properties, LLC (NHP)  is a wholly owned subsidiary of Ventas, Inc. Fitch expects Ventas to repay  $234.4 million of the NHP bonds in May 2015, at which point the remaining NHP  bonds will comprise 0.8% of Ventas' unsecured indebtedness. Therefore, in May  2015, Fitch will likely withdraw the 'BBB+' NHP IDR with a Stable Outlook and  'BBB+' ratings on the remaining NHP bonds, as these ratings will no longer be  relevant to the agency's coverage.

12,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, May 25 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB+' rating to the  senior unsecured notes due 2023 issued by Ventas Realty, L.P. (Issuer Default  Rating 'BBB+'/Outlook Stable), the operating partnership of Ventas, Inc.  (NYSE: VTR). A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The 'BBB+' rating and Stable Outlook reflect Ventas' diverse portfolio of  healthcare properties, demonstrated and consistent access to multiple sources of  capital, adequate liquidity and a deep management team. These strengths are  tempered by leverage that has increased and now persists closer to 6x than 5x.  Other credit concerns include the potential for higher volatility in operating  cash flows through the cycle given the company's REIT Investment Diversification  and Empowerment Act (RIDEA) structured investments and Fitch's broader concerns  surrounding healthcare REITs' rapid growth.  LEVERAGE PERSISTING AT HIGH-END OF RANGE Fitch expects leverage will sustain around 6x unless VTR issues equity or  engages in meaningful asset sales, with the latter less likely given the  issuer's guidance for 2016 indicates only modest net dispositions of $300  million. With leverage persisting at Fitch's rating sensitivity for negative  momentum, VTR has a thin cushion against the potential for deterioration in  recurring operating EBITDA should there be a decline in the RIDEA portfolio or  tenant credit issues in the net lease portfolio. Similarly, Fitch expects it  will be more challenging for VTR to grow meaningfully on a leverage-neutral  basis going forward.  VTR's leverage was 6x and 6.1x for the quarters ended March 31, 2016 and Dec.  31, 2015, respectively. Leverage on a trailing 12 months (TTM) basis is less  relevant given 2015 reported earnings include partial year contributions from  the assets spun-off into Care Capital Properties, Inc. (NYSE: CCP). Fitch  calculates leverage as debt less readily available cash to recurring operating  EBITDA.  STEADY CASH FLOW GROWTH DRIVES FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE (FCC) Fitch assumes cash flow growth will remain steady through 2017 (2% triple net  revenue, 3.5% same-store net operating income growth for seniors housing  operating assets and 3% SSNOI growth for medical office buildings) resulting in  fixed-charge coverage in the low 4x range, which is strong for the rating. FCC  was 4.2x for both the quarter and trailing 12 months (TTM) ended March 31, 2016.  The CCP spin-off has mixed implications for the quality and durability of VTR's  operating income. By removing the majority of its skilled nursing exposure, VTR  improved the quality of its income by increasing the amount derived from private  pay sources. Conversely, the CCP spin-off may increase the volatility of  operating cash flows due to the increasing percentage derived from RIDEA  investments. Fitch assumes RIDEA portfolios (including VTR's) have the potential  for higher volatility through-the-cycle than other owned property types and  notes that the strong 2010-2014 performance was achieved during a period of  robust fundamentals.  Fitch defines fixed-charge coverage as recurring operating EBITDA less  straight-line rent and recurring maintenance capital expenditures to total  interest incurred.  STRONG ACCESS TO CAPITAL & APPROPRIATE LIQUIDITY A key driver of Ventas' ratings is its strong access to capital. Ventas has  consistently demonstrated access to the public unsecured bond markets in the  U.S. and Canada including two 30-year note issuances. Ventas' access to capital  is supplemented by its bank lending group which provides a $2 billion unsecured  revolving credit facility due 2019 assuming extension options are exercised. Fitch projects VTR's sources of liquidity cover its uses by 1x for the period  April 1, 2016 through Dec. 31, 2017 before the 2023 note issuance and 1.2x upon  completion assuming it is $350 million in size and used to repay near-term debt  maturities. Debt maturities are generally manageable until 2018 and 2019 when  $1.4 billion and $1.8 billion mature. Fitch defines sources as readily available  cash, availability under the revolving credit facility and retained cash flow  from operations after dividends and uses as debt maturities, maintenance capital  expenditures and development expenditures.  ADEQUATE CONTINGENT LIQUIDITY VTR's unencumbered asset pool provides adequate contingent liquidity to its  unsecured debt at 1.9x assuming a stressed 8.5% capitalization rate. On the  margin, the portfolio is slightly more leverageable since the CCP spin-off given  the increased contribution from seniors housing, offset in part by the addition  of hospitals from the Ardent transaction to the unencumbered pool which have  limited leveragability. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for VTR include: --2% triple net revenue growth, 3.5% same store NOI growth on seniors housing  operating assets, and 3% same-store NOI growth in medical office buildings  through 2017; --G&A growth to maintain historical margins relative to total revenues;  --$300 million of net dispositions with any incremental acquisitions funded with  a like amount of dispositions; --Debt repayment with the issuance of new unsecured bonds; --AFFO payout ratio of approximately 85%. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may result in positive momentum on the ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.5x (leverage was 6x at  March 31, 2016); --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 4.0x (FCC was  4.2x for the TTM ended March 31, 2016); --Fitch's expectation of unencumbered asset coverage of unsecured debt (UA/UD)  at a stressed 8.5% capitalization rate sustaining above 4.0x (UA/UD was 1.9x at  March 31, 2016). The following factors may result in negative momentum on the ratings and/or  Outlook: --Increased cash flow volatility through the cycle due to heightened RIDEA  exposure and/or material increase in RIDEA exposure; --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 6.0x; --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining below 3.0x; --Fitch's expectation of liquidity coverage sustaining below 1.0x.

20,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, September 14 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB+' rating to the  senior unsecured notes due 2026 issued by Ventas Realty, L.P. (Issuer Default  Rating 'BBB+'/Outlook Stable), the operating partnership of Ventas, Inc.  (NYSE: VTR). A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The 'BBB+' rating and Stable Outlook reflect Ventas' diverse portfolio of  healthcare properties, demonstrated and consistent access to multiple sources of  capital, adequate liquidity and a deep management team. These strengths are  tempered by leverage that has increased and now remains closer to 6x than 5x.  Other credit concerns include the potential for higher volatility in operating  cash flows through the cycle given the company's REIT Investment Diversification  and Empowerment Act (RIDEA) structured investments and Fitch's broader concerns  surrounding the rapid growth of healthcare REITs.  LEVERAGE REMAINS AT HIGH-END OF RANGE Fitch expects leverage will continue to sustain around 6x, and the extent to  which it migrates lower will depend on net acquisition volumes and the timing  and relative mix of funding sources (i.e. debt, newly issued common equity  and/or dispositions). With leverage near Fitch's rating sensitivity for negative  momentum, VTR has a thinner cushion against potential deterioration in recurring  operating EBITDA than in prior years should there be a decline in the RIDEA  portfolio or tenant credit issues in the net lease portfolio. Similarly, Fitch  expects it will be more challenging for VTR to grow meaningfully on a  leverage-neutral basis going forward.  VTR had leverage of 5.9x and 6.2x, respectively, for the quarters ended June 30,  2016 and Dec. 31, 2015. Leverage on a trailing 12-months (TTM) basis is less  relevant given that 2015 reported earnings include partial-year contributions  from the assets spun off into Care Capital Properties, Inc. (NYSE: CCP). Fitch  calculates leverage as debt less readily available cash/recurring operating  EBITDA.  STEADY CASH FLOW GROWTH DRIVES FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE (FCC) Fitch assumes cash flow growth will remain steady through 2017 resulting in FCC  in the low 4x range, which is strong for the rating. FCC was 4.2x for the  quarter ended June 30, 2016. Fitch defines FCC as recurring operating EBITDA  less straight-line rent and recurring maintenance capital expenditures/total  interest incurred.  STRONG ACCESS TO CAPITAL & APPROPRIATE LIQUIDITY A key driver of Ventas' ratings is its strong access to capital. The company has  consistently demonstrated access to the public unsecured bond markets in the  U.S. and Canada including two 30-year note issuances. Ventas' access to capital  is supplemented by its bank lending group which provides a $2 billion unsecured  revolving credit facility due 2019 assuming extension options are exercised. Fitch projects VTR's sources of liquidity cover its uses by 1.1x for the period  July 1, 2016 through Dec. 31, 2017 before the 2026 note issuance. Debt  maturities are generally manageable until 2018 and 2019 when $1.3 billion and  $1.7 billion mature. Fitch defines sources as readily available cash,  availability under the revolving credit facility and retained cash flow from  operations after dividends and uses as debt maturities, maintenance capital  expenditures and development expenditures.  ADEQUATE CONTINGENT LIQUIDITY VTR's unencumbered asset pool provides adequate contingent liquidity to its  unsecured debt at 1.9x assuming a stressed 8.5% capitalization rate as of June  30, 2016. On the margin, the portfolio is slightly more leverageable since the  CCP spin-off given the increased contribution from seniors housing, offset in  part by the addition of hospitals from the Ardent transaction to the  unencumbered pool which have limited leveragability. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for VTR include: --2% triple net revenue growth, 3.5% same store NOI growth on seniors housing  operating assets, and 3% same-store NOI growth in medical office buildings  through 2017; --G&A growth to maintain historical margins relative to total revenues;  --Announced and completed transactions such as the $1.5 billion Wexford  portfolio and $500 million of dispositions with any incremental acquisitions  funded with a like amount of dispositions; --Debt repayment with the issuance of new unsecured bonds; --AFFO payout ratio of approximately 85%. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may result in positive momentum in the ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.5x (leverage was 5.9x at  June 30, 2016); --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 4.0x (FCC was  4.2x for the quarter ended June 30, 2016); --Fitch's expectation of unencumbered asset coverage of unsecured debt (UA/UD)  at a stressed 8.5% capitalization rate sustaining above 4.0x (UA/UD was 1.9x at  June 30, 2016).

23,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 07 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Ventas, Inc.'s (VTR)  Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list  of rating actions follows the end of the release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The 'BBB+' rating and Stable Outlook reflect Ventas' diverse portfolio of  healthcare properties, demonstrated and consistent access to multiple sources of  capital, adequate liquidity and deep management team.  These strengths are tempered by leverage that has increased to the high end of  the range appropriate for the rating and remains closer to 6x than 5x. The  affirmation and Stable Outlook reflect Fitch's expectation that the company can  maintain leverage below 6x should it wish to do so. Nonetheless, Ventas has a  thinner cushion to withstand events such as a largely debt-financed transaction,  a worse than expected decline in senior housing fundamentals or an unforeseen  tenant/lease default.  Other credit concerns include the potential for higher volatility in operating  cash flows through the cycle given the company's REIT Investment Diversification  and Empowerment Act (RIDEA) structured investments and Fitch's broader concerns  surrounding the rapid growth of healthcare REITs.  LEVERAGE REMAINS AT HIGH-END OF RANGE Fitch projects that leverage will continue to sustain around 6x, and whether it  migrates meaningfully lower will depend on the extent to which Ventas  prioritizes/balances rating aspirations and credit metrics with other goals.  With leverage near Fitch's rating sensitivity for negative momentum, VTR has a  thinner cushion against events such as a deterioration in recurring operating  EBITDA than in prior years should there be a decline in the RIDEA portfolio or  tenant credit issues in the net lease portfolio. The ratings have limited  tolerance for leveraging transactions or leverage-neutral transactions that rely  on to-be-completed dispositions or equity issuances. VTR had leverage of 5.9x  and 6.1x, respectively, for the quarters ended June 30, 2016 and Dec. 31, 2015.   This positioning is in contrast to most other REIT asset classes which have  reduced leverage since the financial crisis and are currently operating towards  the lower end of their financial policies. Fitch attributes Ventas' increasing  leverage to its desire to maintain external growth and continue to be a  consolidator in healthcare real estate while asset yields declined and the cost  of its equity fluctuated (as measured by consensus net asset value (NAV) and  price relative to NAV). While Fitch recognizes that healthcare real estate  operates under a different business cycle than other real estate asset classes  because its tenants generally provide non-cyclical and less discretionary  services, Fitch believes healthcare REITs' access to capital and healthcare real  estate values will nonetheless be affected by the broader business and capital  markets cycles which are in later stages.  PIVOTING THE PORTFOLIO VIA LARGE TRANSACTIONS Ventas, which is known for being willing and able to execute on large  transactions, has undergone a fairly material pivot in its portfolio over the  past two years. Ventas disposed of the majority of its post-acute / skilled  nursing exposure via the Care Capital Properties ('BBB-'/Outlook Stable)  spin-off in August 2015, entered acute care hospitals via the Ardent Health  Services transaction also in August 2015, made a follow-on $700 million debt  investment for Ardent's purchase of LHP announced in October 2016 and acquired a  $1.5 billion portfolio of life science buildings in September 2016.  On the margin, the transactions do not materially alter VTR's credit profile  from a qualitative or quantitative perspective given offsetting elements across  the transactions. Instead they demonstrate the issuer pursuing large  transactions to enter or exit sub-sectors, particularly into less  favored/fragmented ones where it believes it can achieve higher returns as a  consolidator.  STEADY CASH FLOW GROWTH DRIVES FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE (FCC) Operating cash flow growth has been resilient sustaining in the low single  digits as measured by same-store net operating income despite significant levels  of supply in senior housing. So far, Ventas' portfolio has exhibited moderating  yet still positive growth though occupancies have declined by 200 basis points  (bps) since the fourth quarter of 2014 (4Q14) and 40 bps since the 2Q14. Fitch  is paying particular attention to how REITs with material senior housing  operating portfolios perform as this is the first test of how they will perform  through a cycle given they were principally triple-net leased during the last  cycle.  Fitch assumes cash flow growth will remain steady through 2018 resulting in FCC  in the low 4x-4.5x range, which is strong for the rating. FCC was 4.2x for the  quarter ended June 30, 2016. Fitch defines FCC as recurring operating EBITDA  less straight-line rent and recurring maintenance capital expenditures/total  interest incurred.  STRONG ACCESS TO CAPITAL & APPROPRIATE LIQUIDITY A key driver of Ventas' ratings is its strong access to capital. The company has  consistently demonstrated access to the public unsecured bond markets in the  U.S. and Canada including two 30-year note issuances. Ventas' access to capital  is supplemented by its bank lending group which provides a $2 billion unsecured  revolving credit facility due 2019 assuming extension options are exercised. Fitch projects VTR's sources of liquidity cover its uses by 1.3x for the period  July 1, 2016 through Dec. 31, 2017 and 0.9x through Dec. 31, 2018 before the  $700 million debt investment in Ardent. Debt maturities are generally manageable  until 2019 when $1.7 billion matures. Fitch defines sources as readily available  cash, availability under the revolving credit facility and retained cash flow  from operations after dividends and uses as debt maturities, maintenance capital  expenditures and development expenditures.  ADEQUATE CONTINGENT LIQUIDITY VTR's unencumbered asset pool provides adequate contingent liquidity to its  unsecured debt at 1.9x assuming a stressed 8.5% capitalization rate as of June  30, 2016. On the margin, the portfolio is slightly more leverageable since the  CCP spin-off given the increased contribution from seniors housing, offset in  part by the addition of hospitals from the Ardent transaction to the  unencumbered pool which have limited leveragability. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for VTR include:  --Operating cash flow growth: Supported by 2.5% growth in SSNOI adjusted for the  timing effects of the CCP, Ardent and Wexford transactions. Fitch has assumed  operating margins decline to reflect lower margins for operating portfolio and  life science portfolios relative to the CCP portfolio.  --Capital expenditures: Fitch's projections reflect announced transactions, $500  million of dispositions in 2016 and net acquisitions of $500 million per year in  2017-2019. Given the challenges in forecasting VTR's acquisition activity, Fitch  has assumed that acquisition volumes above these levels would be funded with a  commensurate amount of equity/dispositions to maintain leverage in the 5.5x-6x  range. Fitch's projections also assume VTR maintains its current spend rate for  development, redevelopment and maintenance capital expenditures. --Capital markets activity: Fitch's projections reflect announced transactions  and assume VTR will issue $1.2 billion of unsecured debt per year to refinance  maturing secured and unsecured debt and other general corporate purposes. RATING SENSITIVITIES While Fitch does not envision positive rating momentum in the near term, the  following factors may have a positive impact on GPT's ratings and/or Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.5x; --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 4.0x; --Fitch's expectation of unencumbered asset coverage of unsecured debt (UA/UD)  at a stressed 8.5% capitalization rate sustaining above 4.0x. The following factors may result in negative momentum in the ratings and/or  Outlook: --Increased cash flow volatility through the cycle due to heightened RIDEA  exposure and/or material increase in RIDEA exposure; --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 6.0x; --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining below 3.0x; --Fitch's expectation of liquidity coverage sustaining below 1.0x. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:  Ventas, Inc. --IDR at 'BBB+'. Ventas Realty Limited Partnership and Ventas Capital Corporation --Unsecured revolving credit facility at 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured term loans at 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured guaranteed notes at 'BBB+'. Ventas Canada Finance Limited --Senior unsecured guaranteed notes at 'BBB+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.
