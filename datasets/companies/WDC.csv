However, the company said it expects to benefit from an improving global economy and a stabilizing PC market in the latter half of the year.For the quarter ended December 27, net income rose to $430 million, or $1.77 per share, in the second quarter from $335 million, or $1.36 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned $2.19 per share, beating analysts' expectations of $2.08 per share.Revenue rose 4 percent to $3.97 billion.

8,"  * Iran wants economic sanctions lifted* Banks wary of falling foul of U.S. regulations* Iran keen to speed up humanitarian trade planBy Jonathan Saul and Parisa HafeziLONDON/ANKARA, March 13 Despite a diplomatic thaw, Western banks are steering clear of attempts by Iran to get them involved in financing humanitarian transactions, fearing they could be penalised under U.S. sanctions, bankers and government officials told Reuters.Iran was never barred from buying food or other humanitarian goods under sanctions imposed because of its disputed nuclear programme, but measures by the European Union and the United States have made trade generally more difficult over the past two years by hindering payments and shipping.As part of talks in Geneva over the nuclear question, Tehran is pressing world powers to speed up trade finance arrangements on humanitarian deals involving both Western and Iranian banks, according to an Iranian government document seen by Reuters and sources familiar with the initiative.Iranian government officials and international trade sources say Tehran wants to simplify complex trade finance arrangements potentially worth billions of dollars, which would alleviate pressure on the country's sanctioned banking system.According to a joint plan of action agreed in November in Geneva, world powers would ""establish a financial channel to facilitate humanitarian trade for Iran's domestic needs using Iranian oil revenues held abroad"".""This channel would involve specified foreign banks and non-designated Iranian banks to be defined when establishing the channel,"" the action plan said.Iran, with its economy under severe pressure, is keen to push this process forward.""We have been informed that according to the negotiations and agreements done in Geneva, the possibility to exchange direct LCs (letters of credit) between seven European banks and eight Iranian banks for food, medication and humanitarian goods has been provided,"" the Iranian government document seen by Reuters says, although it made clear this was not final.""Please note, that we can accept no legal liability regarding this information as it remains to be officially confirmed by the responsible authorities.""BIG BANKS  The U.S. Treasury and EU officials declined to comment.But a U.S. official told Reuters that Washington had been talking with some banks.""Some banks are willing to play a part here. But not all of them. There are a lot of big banks that have been subject to fines for engaging in transactions that were in violation of U.S. sanctions that aren't willing to do anything - even humanitarian,"" the official said.""They just are not willing to do business with Iran. And we are not in a position to say, you have to.""Banks may well feel the need for caution in this area.Regulators in New York and Washington are looking at potential violations by France's Credit Agricole and Societe Generale of U.S. sanctions imposed against countries like Iran, a person familiar with the investigation said.In 2012 New York regulators threatened to revoke Standard Chartered's banking licence after it broke sanctions on Iran. HSBC was fined $1.92 billion by U.S. regulators for various violations including doing business with Iran. In February, BNP Paribas set aside $1.1 billion for a possible fine for breaching U.S. sanctions on countries including Iran. Several banking sources, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject, said Western banks were wary of getting involved in the latest initiative. One said banks would need cast iron assurances that they would not face exposure before even considering it.""It is only natural that banks will be cautious to what the political world offers. It changes so quickly, as events in Ukraine can attest,"" the banker said.""What we could be looking at is very short-term financings or involvements and structures, so you will have optionalities to exit should anything go wrong,"" he added. ""Banks will need more clarity.""INTERIM AGREEMENT Iran and Western governments reached an interim agreement in November last year over Tehran's atomic work in exchange for limited sanctions relief for six months.By late July, Western governments hope to hammer out an accord that would lay to rest their suspicions that Iran is seeking the capability to make a nuclear bomb, an aim it denies, while Tehran wants sanctions lifted.Iranian government officials said the document, which has been sent to Iran's Supreme National Security Council, tasked with safeguarding Tehran's interests, listed the following banks as ""available for further actions"": Standard Chartered Bank (London), Societe Generale (Paris), Banque de Commerce et de Placements (BCP) (Geneva), UniCredit Bank (Munich), Commerzbank (Frankfurt), United Bank (Zurich) and BHF Bank (Frankfurt). It was not clear whether these banks had been approached to provide finance.

14,"  * Gulf banks beginning to compete with Western ones* Growth has helped them boost technical expertise* Pressure on regional fees encourages overseas expansion* Act as channels for issuers to access Gulf funds* Asia, Africa seen as areas of opportunity; sukuk are keyBy Archana NarayananDUBAI, July 3 When the Kenyan government issued a debut $2 billion Eurobond last month, most of the lead arrangers were top Western and African banks. But there was a standout: Qatar's QNB Capital.After decades during which banks from the wealthy Gulf Arab countries rarely ventured outside their region, they are starting to play major roles in arranging bond deals overseas, competing with long-established international banks.This is partly because the Gulf banks have grown, allowing them to build up their technical expertise in bonds and making them keen to expand beyond their crowded home markets.But it is also because the global financial crisis has made the cash-rich Gulf more attractive to overseas bond issuers as a source of investment funds. Gulf banks are seen as the best channels for issuers to attract this money.QNB Capital, a unit of Qatar National Bank, the Gulf state's biggest lender, is now believed to be a strong contender to arrange Kenya's first Islamic bond issue, which is in the planning stage, bankers said.QNB ""is a big bank in the Middle East and it has been involved in arranging other issues in Africa, especially in North Africa,"" said Geoffrey Mwau, economic secretary at the Ministry of Finance in Kenya.""It helps to spread out the investor base by bringing in some from the Middle East, and there are many. They are up and coming."" GROWTH The trend is still in its infancy. In lists of the top 25 arrangers of bond issues globally by monetary value, no Gulf bank appears, according to Thomson Reuters data.Even in their home markets, the Gulf banks are still not dominant. Among the 25 most active arrangers of international bonds from Gulf issuers last year, the highest-ranked Gulf institution was National Bank of Abu Dhabi (NBAD) in sixth place, according to Thomson Reuters data. Dubai's Emirates NBD came in seventh.Only 10 of the 25 banks were from the Gulf; the list featured a wide range of banks from Europe and the United States and Asia, and was headed by HSBC.The last several years have seen a big change, however. As recently as 2011, the top 25 arrangers did not include any Gulf banks at all. Now, even relatively small Gulf institutions such as Dubai Islamic Bank and Saudi Arabia's Riyad Bank  have entered the league tables.There is evidence that the entry of Gulf banks into the bond arranging business within their region has increased competition and squeezed fees - making it more attractive for the Gulf institutions to seek arranging activity outside their region. According to estimates by Thomson Reuters and Freeman Consulting, fees for international dollar bonds arranged in the Gulf this year have totalled about 0.22 percent of the size of the deals, down from roughly 0.58 percent in 2010.Rapid, oil-fuelled growth in the Gulf's banking industry over the last few years has helped local banks bulk up to challenge foreign competitors; banking assets in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council ballooned to $1.47 trillion in 2012  from $1.09 trillion in 2008, according to a study by QNB.This has helped Gulf banks to hire some high-profile talent from international institutions over the past year. Qatar's QInvest hired Michael Katounas from Credit Suisse to lead its investment banking operation; Simon Penney moved from Royal Bank of Scotland to Abu Dhabi's First Gulf Bank  as head of wholesale and international banking, with responsibilities including the debt markets.The global financial crisis supported the trend, by forcing many Western banks to downsize their Gulf operations as they focused on repairing balance sheets back home. Similarly, the introduction of tighter global capital rules in Basel III banking standards over the next few years may help Gulf banks; they are flush with capital, while many Western banks may face higher costs.Meanwhile, the last three years of high oil prices have seen a surge in the amount of money which Gulf Arab states have available to invest abroad. One indicator of this, the Saudi Arabian central bank's net foreign reserves, has jumped 52 percent since May 2011 to $732 billion.At a time of economic instability, this makes Gulf investors highly sought after by many bond issuers around the world. The fact that many Gulf funds are Islamic partly explains the increasing interest around the world in issuing sukuk (Islamic bonds); Senegal is in the process of selling its first sovereign sukuk. Gulf banks, many of them with close links to their governments, are often the best way of reaching top investors in the region such as sovereign wealth funds.When Britain raised 200 million pounds ($345 million) through five-year sukuk last month, two of the five banks mandated to arrange the issue were from the Gulf: NBAD and Qatar's Barwa Bank. They worked alongside HSBC, Standard Chartered and Malaysia's CIMB.SUKUK In fact, sukuk are emerging as a key area in which Gulf banks can expand internationally. Although several foreign banks such as HSBC have major expertise in sukuk, the Gulf banks are based in countries where Islamic banking is mainstream, and some are dedicated Islamic banks themselves; this may give them an advantage in developing their sukuk arranging operations.Three of Turkey's four Islamic banks are affiliates of Gulf banks, which has helped steer Turkish sukuk issues to Gulf arrangers. Sukuk from Albaraka Turk and Kuveyt Turk this year were arranged by Gulf banks.Banks from the Gulf are also looking at Malaysia, which accounts for over two-thirds of global sukuk volumes, and Thailand and Indonesia to expand their arranging business.""We certainly have been Europe- and MENA (Middle East and North Africa)-focused, and continue to be so, in our activity for capital financing be it sukuk, syndication, project finance or structured finance,"" said Khalid Al-Subeai, acting group chief executive at Barwa Bank.""We do think Asia is interesting and we know there is unique value that Barwa Bank can bring, specifically to sukuk issuers.""Dubai's Mashreq Bank, which began arranging syndicated loans for state-run entities and financial institutions in Sri Lanka in 2011, leveraged this into a role as an arranger for a $175 million, five-year bond issue by Sri Lankan Airlines last month. Standard Chartered was lead arranger; QNB Capital was also an arranger.""The Gulf fixed income business is increasingly crowded and the fee income is shrinking.

15,"   By Noel Randewich and Bill Rigby | SAN FRANCISCO/SEATTLE, July 11  SAN FRANCISCO/SEATTLE, July 11 Improved demand for personal computers after years of declines may not last as emerging markets remain weak and recent corporate upgrades in the United States and Europe may prove fleeting.The latest sign that the PC market's stability could be short-lived came from technology distributor Synnex Corp . Its shares have slumped 16 percent since Chief Executive Officer Kevin Murai warned earlier in July that increased demand was already waning from companies buying new computers to upgrade their operating systems after Microsoft Corp stopped supporting Windows XP in April.Investors have pushed shares in PC mainstays Microsoft and Intel Corp and parts suppliers such as Seagate and Western Digital Corp to decade- or record-highs, partly on bets that the global slump in PC demand that began with Apple Inc's launch of the iPad in 2010 may have hit bottom.But detractors point out the story is far from certain. Demand is still falling in emerging markets such as China, crucial to any sustained comeback. While up to a quarter of the world's PCs still employ the 13-year-old Windows XP, it is unclear how many will choose tablets or Apple and Google Inc  ""Chrome"" computers over PCs, rather than upgrade to newer Windows versions.""If this is only a couple quarters of flat growth and all of a sudden we go down to 5 and 7 percent year-over-year declines again, then people are going to get nervous and say we don't know where the bottom is,"" said Chuck Jones, founder of research firm Sand Hill Insights. Intel reports its second-quarter results on Tuesday, while Microsoft posts earnings on July 22 and both are likely to shed more light on the state of the global PC market. Seagate, which reports on July 17 and Western Digital, which gives its results on July 30, could fill in the picture further.BETTER SENTIMENT  Optimism on Wall Street has grown since Intel unexpectedly raised its quarterly and annual revenue outlooks in June, sending its shares to levels not seen in a decade. Microsoft's stock is at highs last seen in 2000.Shipments of PCs were flat in the June quarter, according to research firm Gartner, a better-than-expected result. ""Market feedback on the PC space is much better than 18 months ago,"" memory chipmaker Micron Technology Inc  President Mark Adams told Reuters in June. ""We've been talking and planning about the back half of the year with our customers and  they're pretty focused on making sure we don't take away (DRAM) capacity."" DRAM chips are widely used in PCs.Global tablet shipments in the March quarter fell for the first time ever, according to NPD DisplaySearch. U.S. consumers who once thought they would get by with a tablet are gravitating toward cheap laptops.""The PC is not dead. There is a healthy market under there,"" FBR analyst Chris Rolland said, pointing to a gradually improving U.S. economy.But in China and other developing countries, once major growth engines for the PC industry, shipments of laptops are still falling as consumers choose tablets. It is unclear to what extent people in developing countries will eventually follow wealthier U.S. consumers back to buying both tablets and laptops, said IDC analyst Loren Loverde.Even Microsoft no longer sounds as confident in the PC's prospects. In a recent TV commercial, it described its newest Surface Pro as a ""tablet that can replace your laptop,"" a major shift for a company that still depends on PCs for a sizeable amount of revenue.

16,"  * Russian assets around $8.2 bln at end Q2* Buys Japanese, British and German bonds in Q2* Sells Brazilian, Canadian and Swedish bonds in Q2   (Add detail on Russia)By Gwladys FoucheOSLO, Aug 20 Norway's $885 billion sovereign wealth fund is likely to hang on to its $8.2 billion worth of Russian assets despite Western sanctions on Moscow, but does not plan further purchases because of political risk, it said on Wednesday.The fund, one of the world's biggest investors, has $8.2 billion invested in Russian bonds and stocks, and kept that holding broadly unchanged in recent months, its Chief Executive, Yngve Slyngstad, told a news conference.Over that period Western countries imposed sanctions on Russia, accusing it of backing separatist rebels in Eastern Ukraine. Moscow, denying the charge, hit back by stopping imports of many food products.When asked if the fund has responded by reducing stakes in Russian companies like energy firms Lukoil, Rosneft  and Novatek, or Russia's top banks, Slyngstad said: ""It's not had any effect in the form of sales in those companies."" With one of the longest investment horizons among any investor in the market, the fund is often a big buyer during periods of market turbulence. But Slyngstad said this rule did not apply to volatility in Russia because it was due to geopolitical risk.""In the last eight months in effect we have not been trading the market ... The net activity, both on the equity side and fixed income side is very close to zero,"" he added.""As you can see from our holdings from the year-end, the first quarter and now as of today, there has been no changes in the holdings,"" he later told Reuters.""Therefore I think it is quite easy from that pattern that it is the most likely strategy going forward as well,"" he added. The value of the fund's total holding in Russia rose to 50.7 billion crowns at the end of the second quarter from 47.3 billion at the start of the year with the fixed-income portfolio rising to 28 billion crowns from 24.3 billion.WESTERN BONDS  The fund, which saves Norway's surplus oil and gas revenues for future generations, increased its bond holding in Western countries in the second quarter after selling heavily three months earlier.""The biggest increases in holdings of government bonds were in Japanese, British and German government bonds, while the biggest decreases were in government bonds from Brazil, Canada and Sweden,"" the fund said in its second-quarter report.In the United States, its single biggest investment market, it also increased its fixed income portfolio, just as it did in Italy.The fund, which manages $174,000 for each of Norway's 5.1 million people and is forecast to grow to $1.2 trillion by the end of the decade, returned 3.3 percent in the second quarter, compared with 1.7 percent in the first quarter.""Equity markets rose in the second quarter, and emerging markets performed best,"" Slyngstad said. ""Considerable liquidity flowed into the markets, which pushed asset prices up.""The fund's bond holdings fell to 37.6 percent of its portfolio from 37.7 percent three months earlier, while equity holdings rose to 61.3 percent of the fund from 61.1 percent.The fund also said it would double its leadership group to 12 people, setting up a separate leader group for real estate and also creating a position for control and compliance. Slyngstad will no longer be in charge of risk assessment and allocations.

23,"   By Joseph Menn | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO The U.S. National Security Agency has figured out how to hide spying software deep within hard drives made by Western Digital, Seagate, Toshiba and other top manufacturers, giving the agency the means to eavesdrop on the majority of the world's computers, according to cyber researchers and former operatives.That long-sought and closely guarded ability was part of a cluster of spying programs discovered by Kaspersky Lab, the Moscow-based security software maker that has exposed a series of Western cyberespionage operations.Kaspersky said it found personal computers in 30 countries infected with one or more of the spying programs, with the most infections seen in Iran, followed by Russia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, China, Mali, Syria, Yemen and Algeria. The targets  included government and military institutions, telecommunication companies, banks, energy companies, nuclear researchers, media, and Islamic activists, Kaspersky said. (reut.rs/1L5knm0)The firm declined to publicly name the country behind the spying campaign, but said it was closely linked to Stuxnet, the NSA-led cyberweapon that was used to attack Iran's uranium enrichment facility. The NSA is the agency responsible for gathering electronic intelligence on behalf of the United States.A former NSA employee told Reuters that Kaspersky's analysis was correct, and that people still in the intelligence agency valued these spying programs as highly as Stuxnet. Another former intelligence operative confirmed that the NSA had developed the prized technique of concealing spyware in hard drives, but said he did not know which spy efforts relied on it.NSA spokeswoman Vanee Vines declined to comment.Kaspersky published the technical details of its research on Monday, which should help infected institutions detect the spying programs, some of which trace back as far as 2001. The disclosure could further hurt the NSA's surveillance abilities, already damaged by massive leaks by former contractor Edward Snowden. Snowden's revelations have hurt the United States' relations with some allies and slowed the sales of U.S. technology products abroad.The exposure of these new spying tools could lead to greater backlash against Western technology, particularly in countries such as China, which is already drafting regulations that would require most bank technology suppliers to proffer copies of their software code for inspection.Peter Swire, one of five members of U.S. President Barack Obama's Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technology, said the Kaspersky report showed that it is essential for the country to consider the possible impact on trade and diplomatic relations before deciding to use its knowledge of software flaws for intelligence gathering.""There can be serious negative effects on other U.S. interests,"" Swire said. TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGH According to Kaspersky, the spies made a technological breakthrough by figuring out how to lodge malicious software in the obscure code called firmware that launches every time a computer is turned on.Disk drive firmware is viewed by spies and cybersecurity experts as the second-most valuable real estate on a PC for a hacker, second only to the BIOS code invoked automatically as a computer boots up.""The hardware will be able to infect the computer over and over,"" lead Kaspersky researcher Costin Raiu said in an interview.Though the leaders of the still-active espionage campaign could have taken control of thousands of PCs, giving them the ability to steal files or eavesdrop on anything they wanted, the spies were selective and only established full remote control over machines belonging to the most desirable foreign targets, according to Raiu. He said Kaspersky found only a few especially high-value computers with the hard-drive infections. Kaspersky's reconstructions of the spying programs show that they could work in disk drives sold by more than a dozen companies, comprising essentially the entire market. They include Western Digital Corp, Seagate Technology Plc, Toshiba Corp, IBM, Micron Technology Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. Western Digital, Seagate and Micron said they had no knowledge of these spying programs. Toshiba and Samsung declined to comment. IBM did not respond to requests for comment.GETTING THE SOURCE CODE Raiu said the authors of the spying programs must have had access to the proprietary source code that directs the actions of the hard drives. That code can serve as a roadmap to vulnerabilities, allowing those who study it to launch attacks much more easily. ""There is zero chance that someone could rewrite the [hard drive] operating system using public information,"" Raiu said.Concerns about access to source code flared after a series of high-profile cyberattacks on Google Inc and other U.S. companies in 2009 that were blamed on China. Investigators have said they found evidence that the hackers gained access to source code from several big U.S. tech and defense companies.It is not clear how the NSA may have obtained the hard drives' source code. Western Digital spokesman Steve Shattuck said the company ""has not provided its source code to government agencies."" The other hard drive makers would not say if they had shared their source code with the NSA. Seagate spokesman Clive Over said it has ""secure measures to prevent tampering or reverse engineering of its firmware and other technologies."" Micron spokesman Daniel Francisco said the company took the security of its products seriously and ""we are not aware of any instances of foreign code.""According to former intelligence operatives, the NSA has multiple ways of obtaining source code from tech companies, including asking directly and posing as a software developer.

Disk drive firmware is viewed by spies and cybersecurity experts as the second-most valuable real estate on a PC for a hacker, second only to the BIOS code invoked automatically as a computer boots up.""The hardware will be able to infect the computer over and over,"" lead Kaspersky researcher Costin Raiu said in an interview.Though the leaders of the still-active espionage campaign could have taken control of thousands of PCs, giving them the ability to steal files or eavesdrop on anything they wanted, the spies were selective and only established full remote control over machines belonging to the most desirable foreign targets, according to Raiu. He said Kaspersky found only a few especially high-value computers with the hard-drive infections.Kaspersky's reconstructions of the spying programs show that they could work in disk drives sold by more than a dozen companies, comprising essentially the entire market. They include Western Digital Corp, Seagate Technology Plc , Toshiba Corp, IBM, Micron Technology Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. Western Digital, Seagate and Micron said they had no knowledge of these spying programs. Toshiba and Samsung declined to comment. IBM did not respond to requests for comment.GETTING THE SOURCE CODE Raiu said the authors of the spying programs must have had access to the proprietary source code that directs the actions of the hard drives. That code can serve as a roadmap to vulnerabilities, allowing those who study it to launch attacks much more easily.""There is zero chance that someone could rewrite the [hard drive] operating system using public information,"" Raiu said. Concerns about access to source code flared after a series of high-profile cyberattacks on Google Inc and other U.S. companies in 2009 that were blamed on China. Investigators have said they found evidence that the hackers gained access to source code from several big U.S. tech and defense companies.It is not clear how the NSA may have obtained the hard drives' source code. Western Digital spokesman Steve Shattuck said the company ""has not provided its source code to government agencies."" The other hard drive makers would not say if they had shared their source code with the NSA.Seagate spokesman Clive Over said it has ""secure measures to prevent tampering or reverse engineering of its firmware and other technologies."" Micron spokesman Daniel Francisco said the company took the security of its products seriously and ""we are not aware of any instances of foreign code.""According to former intelligence operatives, the NSA has multiple ways of obtaining source code from tech companies, including asking directly and posing as a software developer. If a company wants to sell products to the Pentagon or another sensitive U.S. agency, the government can request a security audit to make sure the source code is safe.""They don't admit it, but they do say, 'We're going to do an evaluation, we need the source code,'"" said Vincent Liu, a partner at security consulting firm Bishop Fox and former NSA analyst. ""It's usually the NSA doing the evaluation, and it's a pretty small leap to say they're going to keep that source code.""Kaspersky called the authors of the spying program ""the Equation group,"" named after their embrace of complex encryption formulas.The group used a variety of means to spread other spying programs, such as by compromising jihadist websites, infecting USB sticks and CDs, and developing a self-spreading computer worm called Fanny, Kasperky said.Fanny was like Stuxnet in that it exploited two of the same undisclosed software flaws, known as ""zero days,"" which strongly suggested collaboration by the authors, Raiu said.

26,"  (Adds NSA comments in paragraph 6 and 25)By Joseph MennSAN FRANCISCO Feb 16 The U.S. National Security Agency has figured out how to hide spying software deep within hard drives made by Western Digital, Seagate, Toshiba and other top manufacturers, giving the agency the means to eavesdrop on the majority of the world's computers, according to cyber researchers and former operatives.That long-sought and closely guarded ability was part of a cluster of spying programs discovered by Kaspersky Lab, the Moscow-based security software maker that has exposed a series of Western cyberespionage operations.Kaspersky said it found personal computers in 30 countries infected with one or more of the spying programs, with the most infections seen in Iran, followed by Russia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, China, Mali, Syria, Yemen and Algeria. The targets  included government and military institutions, telecommunication companies, banks, energy companies, nuclear researchers, media, and Islamic activists, Kaspersky said. (reut.rs/1L5knm0)The firm declined to publicly name the country behind the spying campaign, but said it was closely linked to Stuxnet, the NSA-led cyberweapon that was used to attack Iran's uranium enrichment facility. The NSA is the U.S. agency responsible for gathering electronic intelligence.A former NSA employee told Reuters that Kaspersky's analysis was correct, and that people still in the spy agency valued these espionage programs as highly as Stuxnet. Another former intelligence operative confirmed that the NSA had developed the prized technique of concealing spyware in hard drives, but said he did not know which spy efforts relied on it.NSA spokeswoman Vanee Vines said the agency was aware of the Kaspersky report but would not comment on it publicly.Kaspersky on Monday published the technical details of its research on Monday, a move that could help infected institutions detect the spying programs, some of which trace back as far as 2001. (bit.ly/17bPUUe)The disclosure could hurt the NSA's surveillance abilities, already damaged by massive leaks by former contractor Edward Snowden. Snowden's revelations have upset some U.S. allies and slowed the sales of U.S. technology products abroad.The exposure of these new spying tools could lead to greater backlash against Western technology, particularly in countries such as China, which is already drafting regulations that would require most bank technology suppliers to proffer copies of their software code for inspection.Peter Swire, one of five members of U.S. President Barack Obama's Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technology, said the Kaspersky report showed that it is essential for the country to consider the possible impact on trade and diplomatic relations before deciding to use its knowledge of software flaws for intelligence gathering. ""There can be serious negative effects on other U.S. interests,"" Swire said.TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGH According to Kaspersky, the spies made a technological breakthrough by figuring out how to lodge malicious software in the obscure code called firmware that launches every time a computer is turned on.Disk drive firmware is viewed by spies and cybersecurity experts as the second-most valuable real estate on a PC for a hacker, second only to the BIOS code invoked automatically as a computer boots up.""The hardware will be able to infect the computer over and over,"" lead Kaspersky researcher Costin Raiu said in an interview.

The stake will be South Korea's single biggest oil asset, providing around 800 million barrels over the 40-year period.Nine Asian and Western companies have bid for stakes in the Abu Dhabi Company for Onshore Oil Operations (ADCO) concession after a deal with Western majors dating back to the 1970s expired in January 2014.

Four oil majors -- ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell , Total and BP -- had each held 9.5 percent equity stakes in the ADCO concession since the 1970s.After the deal expired last year, state-run ADNOC took 100 percent of the concession as political leaders in Abu Dhabi weighed up whether to bring in Asian firms or stick with old partners, industry and diplomatic sources said.Shell and BP have also put in new bids, while Exxon has decided against bidding, sources have told Reuters. Total became the first oil major to renew the concession, putting peers under pressure to improve terms after the local partner said the French firm made the best offer.Other bidders for the concessions include Occidental Petroleum Corp, Italy's ENI, China National Petroleum Corp, and Norway's Statoil.GS Energy, owned by GS Holdings Corp, has a 50 percent stake in South Korea's second-largest crude oil refiner, GS Caltex Corp, with U.S oil major Chevron Corp holding the other half.The ADCO purchase would ""greatly contribute to stable energy supplies"" in South Korea, GS Caltex said in a statement.Abu Dhabi, capital of the UAE, a core Gulf OPEC member, is spending billions of dollars to boost crude oil production capacity to 3.5 million barrels per day by 2017 from around 3 million bpd currently.

For $3.8 billion, a unit of state-owned Tsinghua Holdings Co will get a 15 percent stake in Western Digital. What Tsinghua, run by a university committee, hopes to get is the latest in a string of domestic and foreign footholds in data storage and the chip market, an area deemed of strategic importance by Beijing.Wednesday's Western Digital deal follows Tsinghua's $23 billion move to buy U.S. chipmaker Micron Technology Inc  as China ramps up efforts to develop chips expertise. But the Micron plan has been clouded by U.S. security concerns - and some say the Western Digital may follow suit.""Its (Tsinghua's) Chinese government affiliation is making its overseas acquisition more difficult,"" said Fubon Securities analyst Carlos Peng. Western Digital hopes selling the minority stake to Tsinghua's Unisplendour Corp will help it avoid rigorous regulatory scrutiny. If the deal goes through, the California-based firm will have a new investor with a wide range of China tech units, from IT services provider Unisplendour to biotechnology firm Chengzhi Shareholding Co.The Tsinghua network also stretches to other U.S. firms. In May, Unisplendour announced to buy 51 percent of Hewlett-Packard's H3C Technologies for $2.3 billion, creating a Chinese tech hub that houses H3C's networking operation alongside its China-based server, data-storage and technology-services businesses.Meanwhile in 2014 Intel Corp bought a $1.5 billion, 20 percent stake in two mobile chipmakers under Tsinghua's umbrella. That provided the Chinese firm with support from a U.S. semiconductor giant on chip design and development within China itself - a landmark deal for Beijing.""It (China) is producing its own products rather than just contract making, it's because there's demand from local consumption,"" said Gartner analyst Tracy Tsai.""Tsinghua, with its state-backed role, plays a key part under this background.

Western Digital hopes selling a minority stake will help it avoid rigorous regulatory scrutiny, but U.S. experts say the deal will likely warrant a closer look by domestic authorities.Jeff Bialos, a partner with law firm Sutherland, Asbill & Brennan, said the acquisition would likely require a ""robust review"" by the U.S. government, given ongoing concerns about companies building ""back doors"" into weapons that use advanced electronics. But he said the deal could win approval if mitigations were put in place to limit the influence of the potential Chinese investor.""I expect they would undertake a robust review of this kind of case,"" Bialos, a former senior Pentagon official, said.

Its shares were down 2 percent at $57.40. Crude oil and metal prices resumed their slide on Tuesday, while gold recovered some ground.""(The market is) still groping for direction,"" said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.""You still see this hypersensitivity to what's going on with the price of oil and the market's reacting on a day-to-day basis to that.

Still, the S&P 500  is down 4.8 percent this year.Uncertainty surrounding monetary policy has also curbed investors' appetite for risk. While Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said the central bank will analyze data and global financial and economical conditions before making a decision on interest rates, other policymakers seem to be at odds.Investors will watch for comments by Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari later in the day for clues on the Fed's view on the U.S. economy.Also keenly watched will be economic data, including reports on U.S. home resales and consumer confidence at 10 a.m. ET (1500 GMT). Existing homes sales are forecast to have declined 2.9 percent in January, while consumer confidence likely fell in February on account of the stock market rout.Fitbit sank 14 percent to $14.30 after the wearable fitness device maker forecast profit below estimates.Western Digital dropped 5.8 percent to $43.44 after a government watchdog derailed an investment in the company by China's Unisplendour.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,680 to 896.

The original agreement, struck in October, valued the deal at $19 billion.The collapse of the Unisplendour deal comes during a wave of Chinese takeover interest in U.S. corporations that has already hit a record of $23 billion in announced offers this year, according to Thomson Reuters data. That is nearly double the full-year record reached in 2013.But China's ambitions in the U.S. are receiving increased scrutiny from U.S. politicians, who are concerned about putting certain national businesses in the hands of Chinese executives and government officials.Western Digital said last October that it would revise the cash-and-stock offer for SanDisk if the Unisplendour investment in Western Digital was not successful.  ""It was understood that there was a possibility that the Unis investment in WDC may not happen,"" said Sumit Sadana, SanDisk Executive Vice President. Sadana said that the value of the deal for Sandisk is now $78.50 per share, down from $86.50 when it was originally struck.  Both companies have said they are committed to the agreement, which is expected to close in the first half of this year.Western Digital's stock price has fallen from around $80 per share last October and fell another 7.2 percent to $42.77 on Tuesday.

The London-based fund is pleased with the support it has received, he added. Western Digital said U.S., European Union and other regulators had approved the SanDisk deal. CFIUS, an inter-agency panel led by the U.S. Treasury Department, assesses potential mergers to ensure they do not endanger national security. The panel rarely kills the deals, but several times a year it has informally urged companies to scrap merger plans and they have complied. China led the countries whose planned U.S. acquisitions and investments for 2014 were probed for security issues, according to a government report.In January, Philips (PHG.AS) dropped a plan to sell an 80 percent stake in its Lumileds division to a group that included Chinese investors because of pressure from CFIUS. Fairchild Semiconductor International Inc FCS.O said last week that it rejected an offer from a Chinese takeover group, citing concerns that U.S. regulators would stop the sale.    U.S. lawmakers are also pushing for the rejection of a Chinese company's plan to buy the Chicago Stock Exchange.

CFIUS, an inter-agency panel led by the U.S. Treasury Department, assesses potential mergers to ensure they do not endanger national security. The panel rarely kills the deals, but several times a year it has informally urged companies to scrap merger plans and they have complied. China led the countries whose planned U.S. acquisitions and investments for 2014 were probed for security issues, according to a government report.In January, Philips (PHG.AS) dropped a plan to sell an 80 percent stake in its Lumileds division to a group that included Chinese investors because of pressure from CFIUS. Fairchild Semiconductor International Inc FCS.O said last week that it rejected an offer from a Chinese takeover group, citing concerns that U.S. regulators would stop the sale.    U.S. lawmakers are also pushing for the rejection of a Chinese company's plan to buy the Chicago Stock Exchange.

62,"   By Davide Scigliuzzo  NEW YORK, March 31 (IFR) - Western Digital hit a few roadblocks in the junk bond market this week, putting bankers on edge about other big M&A bonds in the works including a massive trade from Dell.Dell's better ratings and name recognition, and the solid performance of the bonds that backed its management buyout in 2013, should give it some protection from a picky buyside.But after seeing Western Digital labor through the market even while offering some decidedly chunky yields, Dell could also end up struggling when it finally pushes the button.""The market is not as deep as it was and that affected Western Digital and will affect Dell as well,"" one leveraged finance banker told IFR.""It's not as easy to get US$5bn as it was.""Western Digital, a computer storage company with more than US$14bn in revenue last year, got a lukewarm reception from investors for its US$5.225bn M&A deal that priced on Wednesday.The company had to downsize the two-part transaction from US$5.6bn, even after hiking the yield by more than 100bp to help finance its acquisition of SanDisk.The US$3.35bn unsecured eight-year non-call three junk tranche - the biggest junk bond offering this year, according to IFR data - priced at a final yield of 10.5%, or almost 500bp over the average of similarly rated paper.A US$1.875bn seven-year non-call three secured investment-grade tranche priced at a final yield of 7.375% - just 100bp inside the average yield on Single B junk bonds - and had first been whispered in the low 6%s.""On the one hand you have an out-of-favor credit that found a clearing level,"" the banker said.""But on the other hand it is a big Double B that struggled to get done. I am looking at it as implications for Dell.""STARTED FROM THE BOTTOM  Western Digital encountered difficulties even though the high-yield market has been on the rebound in recent weeks following a sluggish start to the year.Helped by a bounce in crude oil prices from multi-year lows - oil credits make up roughly 12% of the junk space by market value - high-yield spreads have tightened dramatically.The average junk bond spread, at a more than four-year high of 887bp on February 11, had narrowed to 703bp by Wednesday, according to data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.That compression, and US$13.3bn of inflows into the asset class in five weeks from late February to mid-March, enticed a number of junk-rated borrowers to jump back into the market.Even some previously hung deals such as Kraton Polymers have reemerged successfully - but Western Digital's sky-high yield showed that the buyside is still more than a little hesitant.Western Digital - along with Dell - is selling debt out of a computing sector burdened with an overhang of growth and revenue worries, and that was a concern for investors. ""Western Digital bought a business where earnings are going to be 20%-30% lower this year,"" said a London-based portfolio manager who passed on the deal.COLD STORAGE Like Western Digital, Dell is eyeing a mix of investment-grade and high-yield bonds to finance the purchase of a data storage company - but on a much vaster scale.The Texas computer giant is expected to sell as much as US$25bn in the bond markets - some five times what WD raised - to fund its purchase of EMC, a fellow S&P 500 company.It is looking to raise about the same amount in loans - in what could be a roughly US$50bn package - and if size was an issue for WD, Dell could face some push-back as well.""I do think the size implication is real,"" a second banker told IFR. ""But Dell is going to look a lot better in terms of credit."" WD's investment-grade tranche carried just two high-grade ratings. Dell's are expected to have three - and it also has a good track record with bond investors.""Dell has built goodwill with significant debt reductions,"" said a longtime portfolio manager based in the United States.""It is a veteran issuer in the leveraged finance markets that has demonstrated an ability to evolve as the business environment for its products changes.""NOT ALONE While Dell is the biggest M&A financing in the pipeline, it's not expected to come until at least May. Others, meanwhile, are being readied sooner.A US$3.1bn second-lien bond backing private equity group Apollo's leveraged buyout of US security firm ADT is likely to surface in about three weeks.That trade, expected to carry Single B ratings, will be bolstered by a big equity check provided by Apollo - about 35% of the enterprise value.Others are also talking about whether the Veritas US$5.6bn loan and bond package that was pulled in November in the face of weak investor demand could be revived.That deal got yanked even after pricing and discounts on the loan were increased - and some in the market say it is unlikely to look more attractive in the months ahead.""If you can buy Western Digital at 10.5%, the Veritas unsecured doesn't look that awesome,"" another banker said.(Reporting by Davide Scigliuzzo; Editing by Marc Carnegie and Natalie Harrison)",2016-03-31,WDC,"Thu Mar 31, 2016 | 5:03pm EDT","After Western Digital struggles, focus turns to Dell",http://www.reuters.com//article/uscorpbonds-highyield-dell-idUSL2N1730WU?type=companyNews

71,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, August 11 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of 'BBB-/RR1' to  Western Digital Corporation's (Western Digital) $3 billion seven-year Senior  Secured Term Loan B-1. The company's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is  currently 'BB+', and the Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of current  ratings follows at the end of this release. Western Digital amended the April 29, 2016 Existing Loan Agreement to establish  New Senior Secured Term B-1 Loans, the proceeds from which will be used to  refinance outstanding principal amounts under the Senior Secured U.S. Term B  Loans, reducing annual interest expense. Western Digital expects amounts  outstanding under the Senior Secured U.S. Term B Loans will be $3 billion, pro  forma for a $750 million voluntary prepayment expected to be consummated  contemporaneous with the Amendment's Effective Date.  Terms of the Amended Loan Agreement are substantially the same as those of the  Existing Loan Agreement. All obligations of Western Digital under the Amended  Loan Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by each of the  company's wholly-owned domestic Restricted Subsidiaries. Borrowings under the  Amended Loan Agreement are secured by a perfected first-priority security  interest in substantially all the Borrowers' and Guarantors' tangible and  intangible assets, including 65% of the voting stock of first tier foreign  subsidiaries. KEY RATING DRIVERS --Diversified Storage Portfolio: Fitch believes the SanDisk acquisition, closed  May 12, 2016, diversifies Western Digital's technology portfolio. The  combination positions Western Digital for next generation storage platforms  optimizing hard disk drives (HDDs), NAND flash-based solid state drives (SSD)  and software, while mitigating nearer-term SSD cannibalization of HDDs. --Increased Scale: The SanDisk acquisition increases Western Digital's scale and  supports higher investment intensity, driven by rapid industry evolution around  cloud driven data growth and new storage architectures, including 3D NAND, and  larger competitors. Should operating cash flows at Western Digital's joint  venture (JV) with Toshiba Corporation (Toshiba) or equipment leases be  insufficient to keep pace with 3D NAND development intensify, Western Digital  and Toshiba Corporation may jointly decide to contribute capital to the JV.  --Margin Expansion Roadmap: Fitch expects cost synergies from the SanDisk  acquisition and integration of Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (Hitachi)  will drive profit margin expansion. Fitch believes Western Digital is on track  to achieve cost synergies, including $474 million of run-rate cost synergies  exiting calendar 2016 and $800 million exiting calendar 2017 related to Hitachi.  Given Western Digital's high fixed cost model, lower fixed costs should drive  operating EBITDA margin expansion to the mid-20s from the low 20s on a  pre-synergy basis. --Commitment to Debt Reduction: Fitch expects rapid debt reduction from free  cash flow (FCF) and tax efficient use of offshore cash, made possible in  connection with a restructuring that is expected to relocate SanDisk's domestic  intellectual property (IP) offshore, will result in the Company achieving its  1.5x total leverage (total debt to operating EBITDA) target in the  intermediate-term. Fitch expects annual FCF of $1.5 billion to $2 billion beyond  the near term, during which Fitch believes the vast majority of cash  restructuring costs will largely offset recurring FCF. Until Western Digital  achieves the 1.5x total leverage target, Fitch expects the company will limit  share repurchases to offsetting dilution.  --Significant Technology Risk: Fitch believes Western Digital is subject to  significant technology risk from the storage industry's rapid evolution and  emergence of new storage architectures. Western Digital's strategy of layering  optimized software onto hybrid HDDs/SSDs for next generation platform solutions  shifts the company's focus to hyper-scale and traditional data center markets  but also intensifies technology risk related to a wider array of competitors  with alternative technologies. --3D NAND Roadmap: Fitch believes Western Digital could structurally trail  competitors in 3D NAND-based products and solutions through the intermediate  term, potentially adversely impacting operating results and reducing FCF for  debt reduction. Western Digital plans to ship meaningful volumes of its next  generation 3D NAND technology, BiCS3, in the first half of calendar 2017, while  Samsung, Micron and Intel currently are shipping 3D NAND. Western Digital is  accelerating fab conversion to 3D from 2D NAND to increase the mix of 3D NAND to  approximately 40% of total wafer capacity by the end of 2017, in line with the  industry.  --Revenue Pressures and Volatility: Fitch expects Western Digital will face  near- to intermediate-term revenue pressures and that increased exposure to  datacenter spending should amplify volatility. Fitch expects the continuation of  negative PC unit growth and increased SSD cannibalization of HDDs in PCs and  performance enterprise. Fitch expects SanDisk's removable retail business will  continue being pressured by the increased use of cloud based storage and the  decreased use of single function electronic devices, such as cameras. Meanwhile,  a sales mix shift to datacenters should improve visibility but also add top line  volatility from capex cycles. Beyond the next two years, Fitch anticipates low-  to mid-single digit organic revenue growth from market growth in datacenters and  enterprise markets. --High Leverage Reduces Flexibility: Leverage was a Fitch estimated just over 4x  for fiscal 2016, excluding expected cost synergies but pro forma for the  repayment of the Bridge Loan and refinancing and $750 million Term Loan B  repayment.  Including cost synergies, Fitch estimates leverage closer to 3.5x.  Fitch believes reducing leverage is imperative for Western Digital, as  investments in innovation, including potential IP-driven acquisitions, are  critical to long-term success given rapid technology evolution.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Low-single digit organic revenue growth in 2017 and mid-single revenue growth  in 2018, driven by client SSD unit growth, moderating PC unit declines, and  significant data growth driving enterprise SSD and nearline HDD unit growth; --Significant synergies related to Western Digital's integration of Hitachi and  SanDisk driving meaningful profit margin expansion, despite pressures in the  removable retail business and core NAND markets such as smartphones; --Repatriation of foreign cash for debt prepayment; --No increases to the dividend or share repurchases beyond anti-dilution until  the company achieves its target leverage of 1.5x. RATING SENSITIVITIES The ratings may be downgraded if Fitch expects: --Sustained negative revenue growth, likely from i) slower than anticipated  growth within enterprise that is insufficient to offset the secular decline in  PCs and the removable storage market, or ii) market share losses to competing  technologies, including 3D NAND; or --Slower than expected debt reduction resulting in total leverage sustained  above 3x. Positive rating actions would require Fitch's expectations for: --Consistently positive mid-cycle organic revenue growth from successful  implementation of the company's strategy, including increased penetration in  enterprise growth markets by leveraging its technology stack; and --Western Digital to reach 1.5x total leverage from significant voluntary debt  reduction. LIQUIDITY Fitch believes Western Digital's liquidity was adequate as of July 1, 2016 and  consisted of: --$8.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, $1.3  billion of which located in the U.S. and $3 billion of which was used to repay  the $3 billion Bridge Loan; --An undrawn and fully available $1 billion Senior Secured Revolving Credit  Facility expiring April 29, 2021. Fitch's expectations for $1.5 billion to $2 billion of annual FCF beyond the  near term also support liquidity. In the near-term, Fitch believes cash  restructuring costs will largely offset recurring FCF. Pro forma for incurring the $3 billion of Term Loan B-1 and repayment of $3.75  billion of Term Loan B and Bridge Loan after the recent quarter end, total debt  was $13.2 billion at July 1, 2016 and consisted primarily of: --$4.125 billion Senior Secured Term Loan A expiring April 29, 2021; --$3 billion Senior Secured Term Loan B expiring April 29, 2023; --Euro 885 million Senior Secured Term Loan B expiring April 29, 2023; --$1.875 billion of 7.375% Senior Secured Notes due April 1, 2023; and --$3.35 billion of 10.5% Senior Unsecured Notes due April 1, 2024.
