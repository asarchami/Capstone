0,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Transocean Ltd (RIGN.S) on Thursday won the dismissal of an appeal by shareholders accusing the owner of the doomed Deepwater Horizon drilling rig of deceiving them about its safety practices prior to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill.The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said the lead plaintiff waited two months too long to sue over alleged misstatements in an Oct. 2, 2007, proxy statement for the offshore drilling company's merger with GlobalSantaFe Corp.Shares of Transocean rose 3 percent after the decision was issued.Geoffrey Johnson, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, declined to comment. Transocean and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Former GlobalSantaFe shareholders, who received Transocean shares in the merger, said the proxy statement contained false and misleading statements about the company's compliance with environmental laws.Led by the DeKalb County Pension Fund in Decatur, Georgia, the shareholders sought to hold the Swiss company liable for their losses after the April 20, 2010, explosion of the Deepwater Horizon and blowout of BP Plc's (BP.L) Macondo well. The disaster caused Transocean shares to lose more than half their value within seven weeks.Writing for the appeals court, however, Circuit Judge José Cabranes said the Georgia fund did not join the case until Dec. 3, 2010, missing the three-year deadline to sue over the proxy statement.He said it did not matter that the lawsuit was originally filed before the deadline, but by another shareholder that was later dismissed from the case because it lacked standing. The plaintiff ""through minimal diligence"" could have saved its case by getting involved sooner and offered no justification for its lateness, Cabranes wrote.The Georgia fund had argued that the three-year clock began to tick when the Deepwater Horizon exploded, bring Transocean's prior misstatements to light.Thursday's decision upheld a March 2014 dismissal of the lawsuit by U.S. District Judge Lorna Schofield in Manhattan. Transocean agreed in January 2013 to pay $1.4 billion in civil and criminal fines and penalties to settle U.S. government claims over the spill.BP has incurred $55.5 billion of costs for the spill. It faces its own U.S. shareholder lawsuit in Houston federal court.In early afternoon trading, Transocean's American depositary receipts (RIG.N) were up 3 percent at $11.56. Its shares in Switzerland were up 3 percent at 11.11 Swiss francs.The case is DeKalb County Pension Fund v. Transocean Ltd et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 14-0894.

7,"   By Arathy S Nair  Chesapeake Energy Corp (CHK.N) said on Tuesday that two directors, including a representative of activist investor Carl Icahn, resigned on Monday, a week after Icahn more than halved his stake in the natural gas producer.Chesapeake said the resignations of Icahn representative Vincent Intrieri, along with John Lipinski, board members since June 2012 and June 2014 respectively, were not due to any disagreements. (bit.ly/2cSkDJK)However, the No. 2 U.S. natural gas producer did not specify why the two had stepped down. Chesapeake, Icahn, Intrieri and Lipinski were not immediately available for comment.Icahn said last week that Chesapeake's management had done ""an admirable job"" over the last few years and that he had reduced his stake in the company – by 51.6 percent to 4.55 percent – for tax-planning purposes. (bit.ly/2cSkpT7)Chesapeake shares were down 9 percent at $6.02 in early afternoon trading, amid a broader decline by energy company stocks due to a sharp drop in crude oil prices.Investors could be thinking that the resignations indicate that Icahn believes the stock cannot rise further or that he had a disagreement with the company, said James Sullivan, an analyst with Alembic Global Advisors.""But he is out of it and ... people pile in when he piles in, people pile out when he piles out,"" Sullivan said. Up to Monday's close, Chesapeake's stock had dropped 55 percent since May 2012, when Icahn revealed a stake in the company and campaigned to replace at least four directors. The stock had lost 2.8 percent since he cut his stake last week, but had gained about 47 percent since the start of the year.PRESSURE SINCE 2012 Chesapeake said in August it had reduced debt by more than $1 billion this year and had undertaken a couple of debt-for-equity swaps to reduce interest payments and a crippling debt  taken on to fund shale development. The company raised its 2016 asset sales target and production forecast last month. Intrieri, who has served as senior executive of Icahn Capital LP, had been on Chesapeake's board since June 2012, when   Chesapeake was under intense pressure from investors to improve its corporate governance.Reuters reported in 2012 that then-Chief Executive Aubrey McClendon had taken out more than $1 billion in loans using his personal stakes in thousands of company wells as collateral.Icahn said then that the board had failed ""in a dramatic fashion"" in its oversight of management and its earlier promises to act in a more financially responsible way had proven hollow. Bowing to pressure, Chesapeake named four new independent directors – Intrieri as well as three proposed by Southeastern Asset Management, its largest shareholder at the time.Icahn also has a history with Lipinski. He said in 2012 that Lipinski, then CEO of CVR Energy Inc (CVI.N), was more interested in empire building than in increasing shareholder value.Since then, the relationship has improved, with Icahn asking shareholders to vote Lipinski to Transocean Ltd's (RIGN.S) board. Icahn did not nominate Lipinski to Chesapeake's board.McClendon, a brash risk-taker who helped transform the U.S. energy industry with shale gas, died when his car slammed into an overpass in March, a day after he was charged with breaking federal antitrust laws.Chesapeake also said on Tuesday it had received bids totaling $933.3 million on the expiration of its offers to buy up to $800 million of non-convertible senior notes.
