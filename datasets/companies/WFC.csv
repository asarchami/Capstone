2,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, January 14 (Fitch) Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) reported another  quarter of record earnings despite a relatively weak economic recovery and  challenging interest rate environment. Earnings ticked up slightly, buoyed by  both modest revenue growth and controlled expenses, resulting in a solid return  on average assets (ROA) of 1.47%. Fitch views the results favorably as WFC  appears to have been able to react nimbly to the changing mortgage refinancing  market. WFC's credit profile also benefits from continuing improvement in asset  quality, and unlike some of its large bank peers, WFC has reported relatively  manageable litigation-related charges to date.  Revenues were up slightly (1%) on both higher spread income and improved  noninterest income. WFC reported decent sequential loan growth with loans  increasing 7% on an annualized basis from the prior quarter, with broad-based  growth across many asset classes. Fitch expects this level of loan growth will  surpass peer averages.  The net interest margin (NIM) continued to contract a  further 12bps in 4Q'13, reflecting both deposit growth and liquidity-related  actions taken last quarter by WFC.  Mortgage results were relatively resilient in 4Q'13. While mortgage originations  declined by nearly 40%, mortgage banking noninterest income fell only 2% from  the prior quarter. Servicing income increased by roughly 40% due primarily to a  write-up in the valuation of the mortgage servicing rights (MSR) asset in light  of higher mortgage interest rates. Offsetting this, gain on sale revenue fell  22%, reflecting lower origination volumes. Offsetting the decline in mortgage  revenues, WFC reported stronger trust and investment fees, up 6% on a  linked-quarter basis.   Expenses were flat sequentially. Lower staffing costs in mortgage were offset by  higher equipment expenses reflecting annual license renewals. WFC also reported  higher outside professional services expenses related to compliance and  regulatory-related initiatives.  WFC reported a smaller reserve release on a sequential basis of $600 million as  compared to $900 million last quarter. Net charge-offs (NCOs) remained very  manageable at just 47bps of average loans during the quarter supported by lower  consumer losses. Provision expenses increased to $363 million during the  quarter, up from just $75 million last quarter, marking the first increase in  quarterly provision expenses for the year. WFC expects future reserve releases, absent a significant deterioration in  economic conditions. Fitch notes that NCOs at this level are likely not  sustainable, with historical losses more around the 100bps range.  As previously disclosed, WFC has now reached agreements with both Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac resolving substantially all repurchase liabilities related to loans  sold prior to Jan. 1, 2009. Fitch viewed these agreements favorably as they  resolve the majority of mortgage-related repurchase risk for WFC. Existing and  any future repurchase requests would stem from loans sold to the GSEs outside of  the covered periods, as well as to private investors. The ending balance of  reserves totaled approximately $900 million or 127% of the original loan balance  of unresolved repurchase demands as of Dec. 31, 2013.  Tier 1 common under Basel III improved by approximately 22bps to an estimated  9.78% at Dec. 31, 2013, and exceeded the company's internal target of 9%. Fitch  views WFC as well-positioned for Basel III capital guidelines. Net unrealized  securities gains totaled $3.9 billion at year-end 2013, down from $5.8 billion  at Sept. 30, 2013, primarily driven by an increase in interest rates during the  quarter. As an Advanced Approach bank, WFC will be ultimately be subject to  fluctuations in AOCI under Basel III..

3,"   By Peter Rudegeair and Anil D'Silva  Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) posted a better-than-expected 11 percent jump in quarterly profit as it cut costs, but mortgage lending slowed to the lowest level in five years.The fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets said core lending grew by 6 percent, boosted by a sharp jump in trade finance, commercial real estate and other loans to foreign companies and a 10 percent rise in auto loans - a feat that Chief Financial Officer Tim Sloan called ""absolutely terrific."" The bank also dipped into money it had set aside to cover bad loans, as credit quality improved with a recovering economy.""We sit here this January as an economy, and frankly as a company, in better shape than I have sat here in the last five or six Januaries,"" Chief Executive John Stumpf said on a conference call after Wells Fargo reported its results. He said he is optimistic that loans and revenues could increase over time.Stumpf's somewhat upbeat outlook shows how the industry is still waiting for the economic recovery to translate into more broad-based loan growth and profits.The mortgage business, which had been one bright spot for banks such as Wells, suffered a steep decline industry-wide as fewer consumers refinanced home loans because of higher mortgage rates. At Wells Fargo, the mortgage decline overshadowed improvements in many of its 89 other businesses. The bank's revenue fell 6 percent to $20.7 billion.Wells made nearly one in five U.S. home loans in the first nine months of 2013, according to industry publication Inside Mortgage Finance. In 2013, the business accounted for 10 percent of the bank's overall revenues.""They have various other business lines to offset"" the decline in mortgages, said Christopher Mutascio, a banking analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. ""But that's just it - they can only offset it; they can't grow revenue.""Wells Fargo made $50 billion of residential mortgage loans in the quarter, less than half the $125 billion in the same period a year earlier and down from $80 billion in the third quarter. Income from mortgage lending fell to $1.6 billion from $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012.The last time the bank made that few home loans was in the fourth quarter of 2008 at the depths of the financial crisis.Sloan said on a conference call with analysts that the bank expects mortgage volume to continue to fall in the first quarter of 2014, though not as much as in the third and final quarters of 2013. JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), which also reported quarterly profits on Tuesday, also said its mortgage business slowed, although the largest U.S. bank by assets also had to contend with other headaches, notably its legal issues.Wells Fargo's shares edged up 0.07 percent to close at $45.59 on the New York Stock Exchange.PROFIT RISES Fourth-quarter net income applicable to common shareholders increased to $5.37 billion, or $1 per share, from $4.86 billion, or 91 cents per share, a year earlier, the San Francisco-based bank said on Tuesday.Analysts, on average, had expected earnings of 98 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Expenses in the bank's home loan unit fell after it cut 6,200 positions in the second half of 2013. Those severance costs mostly impacted the bank's third quarter results.The lower personnel expenses pushed its efficiency ratio, or expenses relative to revenue, to 58.5 percent and into its targeted range of 55 to 59 percent.Net income also got a boost as the bank released $600 million from its loss reserves, or money previously set aside to cover bad loans. That was more than double the $250 million released in the year-earlier quarter but less than the $900 million released in the third quarter.Seeing a bank increase profits with lower revenues is more encouraging than seeing lower profits with higher revenues, ""so you'd have to be a hater to find fault in their results,"" said Chris Richey, a portfolio manager and managing director at Neosho Capital, a $165 million investment firm that holds Wells Fargo shares.WACHOVIA DEAL DIVIDENDS  Wells Fargo is one of the few large U.S. banks to emerge much stronger from the financial crisis, thanks in part to its acquisition of Wachovia, which closed just over five years ago.Many of the old Wachovia businesses performed well in the quarter. The bank's wealth, brokerage and retirement group earned $491 million, up nearly 40 percent from the same period a year earlier.Profit from advising wealthy clients on investments and financial planning rose 40 percent from a year earlier to $140 million on just 11 percent growth in client assets and deposits. This compared with a 4 percent rise in wholesale banking profit and a 12 percent jump in community banking profit.The wealth sector also led the other businesses in cross-marketing, a major goal of big institutions such as Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Wells that own retail brokerage networks.Average loans generated by the wealth sector grew to $48.4 billion in the fourth quarter from $43.3 billion a year earlier. The average client in the wealth sector ended the year owning 10.42 Wells products, such as a checking account or an IRA, up from 10.27 a year ago. The cross-sell in the wholesale bank was 7.1 products per relationship.Wells Fargo increased its market share of the U.S. investment banking business to 5.6 percent in 2013, up from 5 percent in 2012 as revenue from existing wholesale banking customers grew 16 percent. The bank had acquired its investment banking business from Wachovia.The growth in that business declined in the fourth quarter as sales and trading slowed, Sloan said in an interview.Wells Fargo's stock jumped 28.7 percent in 2013, but lagged the 34.3 percent increase in the KBW index of bank stocks .BKX. The company had a market value of $243.2 billion at the end of the year, making it the largest U.S. bank by that measure.(Reporting by Anil D'Silva in Bangalore and Peter Rudegeair in New York; Additional reporting by Lauren LaCapra and Jed Horowitz; Editing by Ted Kerr, Bernadette Baum and Richard Chang)",2014-01-14,WFC,"Tue Jan 14, 2014 | 4:17pm EST",Wells Fargo profit beats estimates; mortgage loans slump,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-wellsfargo-results-idUSBREA0D0RS20140114?type=companyNews

17,"  Stewart Cink, seeking his first PGA Tour title in five years, charged into a one-shot lead at the Farmers Insurance Open on Thursday as Phil Mickelson also moved into early contention despite nursing a troublesome back.Mickelson, who frequently winced at the top of his backswing because of muscle pain down his side, carded a three-under 69 on the easier North Course while seven-times champion Tiger Woods opened with an even 72 on the brutal South layout.Cink, who has not triumphed anywhere since his playoff victory over Tom Watson in the 2009 British Open at Turnberry, fired a flawless 64 on the North to seize control of the PGA Tour event at picturesque Torrey Pines outside San Diego.The 40-year-old Cink birdied four of his last six holes to end a mainly sunny day which began with a fog delay of 30 minutes one stroke in front of fellow American Gary Woodland, who also started out on the North.Australians Jason Day and Marc Leishman, South African Tyrone van Aswegen and American Jim Herman opened with 66s while American Pat Perez, with a 67, was the only player in the top 16 who played on the more difficult South layout.Tour veteran Cink was delighted with his opening round, despite totaling just one birdie on the four par-five holes.""If you drive it well on the North Course, you're going to have birdie opportunities and I drove it very well most of the day,"" the tall American told Golf Channel.""It was just a different game from the short grass out there. You've got some shorter holes and I took advantage of a lot of those holes ... the par-fives, I didn't play those very well. It was a very calm, very relaxed kind of round."" Cink, a six-times winner on the PGA Tour, knows he will face a very different challenge in Friday's second round on the South Course, which played almost four strokes harder than the North on Thursday.""It's definitely a tale of two golf courses here,"" he smiled. ""The South we all know is one of the most difficult courses on the tour and it pretty much requires all facets of the game to be on.""I have been playing fairly well this year … so I am looking forward to the challenge. It's a big golf course to really test yourself and see where you stand this time of year.""PLAYING TOUGH  Woods, competing in his first tournament of the year, offset two birdies with two bogeys on a South layout playing tougher than usual because of firm conditions, narrow fairways and thick rough.""Well, even par's not too bad, but I didn't play the par-fives worth a darn today,"" said the world number one, who clinched last year's Farmers Insurance Open by four shots in a fog-delayed Monday finish.""I played them even par, parred all of them ... to try to get any kind of scoring on the South course you've got to take care of the par-fives because there's not a lot of holes you can make birdies here.""It (the South) has got to be playing right around three shots easier, so I'm going to have to go out there and get it a little bit tomorrow to not be so far behind come Saturday or Sunday."" San Diego native Mickelson, a three-times champion at Torrey Pines, mixed four birdies with a lone bogey to climb the leaderboard and was thankful he had played his opening round on the less daunting North.""I kind of milked my way around the golf course and I was able to do that on the North Course because the penalty wasn't as severe as it is on the South,"" the American left-hander said.""I am able to kind of get it up by the green and get up and down and salvage par. I made a couple of birdies but it won't hold up on the South Course so I've got to get it better.""Asked to explain what was wrong, Mickelson replied: ""From the top (on the swing), it just kept locking up and giving me a shooting pain. I kind of flinch.""If I overdo it, it's just prone to getting a little bit tight. It's just a muscular thing. My back feels fine, it's just a muscle on the side. I think it will go away in a short period of time. I don't think it's anything serious.""However, Mickelson said he would consider withdrawing from the event if his muscle pain did not respond sufficiently to treatment over the next 24 hours.(Reporting by Mark Lamport-Stokes in Los Angeles; Editing by Frank Pingue)",2014-01-24,WFC,"Thu Jan 23, 2014 | 8:18pm EST","Cink in control at Torrey Pines, Tiger cards a 72",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-golf-pga-idUSBREA0N02X20140124?type=companyNews

26,"  By Peter Rudegeair and Michelle ConlinFeb 14 Wells Fargo & Co, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, is tiptoeing back into subprime home loans again.The bank is looking for opportunities to stem its revenue decline as overall mortgage lending volume plunges. It believes it has worked through enough of its crisis-era mortgage problems, particularly with U.S. home loan agencies, to be comfortable extending credit to some borrowers with higher credit risks.The small steps from Wells Fargo could amount to a big change for the mortgage market. After the subprime mortgage bust brought the banking system to the brink of collapse in the financial crisis, banks have shied away from making home loans to anyone but the safest of consumers.Any loosening of credit standards could boost housing demand from borrowers who have been forced to sit out the recovery in home prices in the past couple of years, but could also stoke fears that U.S. lenders will make the same mistakes that had triggered the crisis.So far few other big banks seem poised to follow Wells Fargo's lead, but some smaller companies outside the banking system, such as Citadel Servicing Corp, are already ramping up their subprime lending. To avoid the taint associated with the word ""subprime,"" lenders are calling their loans ""another chance mortgages"" or ""alternative mortgage programs.""And lenders say they are much stricter about the loans than before the crisis, when lending standards were so lax that many borrowers did not have to provide any proof of income. Borrowers must often make high down payments and provide detailed information about income, work histories and bill payments.Wells Fargo in recent weeks started targeting customers that can meet strict criteria, including demonstrating their ability to repay the loan and having a documented and reasonable explanation for why their credit scores are subprime.It is looking at customers with credit scores as low as 600. Its prior limit was 640, which is often seen as the cutoff point between prime and subprime borrowers. U.S. credit scores range from 300 to 850.Lenders remain cautious in part because of financial reform rules. Under the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, mortgage borrowers must meet eight strict criteria including earning enough income and having relatively low debt. If the borrower does not meet those hurdles and later defaults on a mortgage, he or she can sue the lender and argue the loan should never have been made in the first place.Those kinds of rules have helped build a wall between prime and subprime borrowers. Lenders have been courting consumers who are legally easier to serve, and avoiding those with weaker credit scores and other problems. Subprime borrowers accounted for 0.3 percent of new home loans in October 2013, compared with an average of 29 percent for the 12 months ended February 2004, according to Mark Fleming, the chief economist of CoreLogic.With Wells Fargo looking at loans to borrowers with weaker credit, ""we believe the wall has begun to come down,"" wrote Paul Miller, a bank analyst at FBR Capital Markets, in a research note.Lenders have an ample incentive to try reaching further down the credit spectrum now. Rising mortgage rates since the middle of last year are expected to reduce total U.S. mortgage lending in 2014 by 36 percent to $1.12 trillion, the Mortgage Bankers Association forecasts, due to a big drop in refinancings. Some subprime lending can help banks, but it may also help the economy. In September 2012, then Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said housing had been the missing piston in the U.S. recovery.A recent report from think tank the Urban Institute and Moody's Analytics argued that a full recovery in the housing market ""will only happen if there is stronger demand from first-time homebuyers. And we will not see the demand needed among this group if access to mortgage credit remains as tight as it is today.""Subprime mortgages were at the center of the financial crisis, but many lenders believe that done with proper controls, the risks can be managed and the business can generate big profits.MAKING UP WITH THE AGENCIES For Wells Fargo, one of the critical factors in the new strategy was its clearing up of disputes with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, said Franklin Codel, Wells Fargo's head of mortgage production in Des Moines, Iowa. The 2013 settlements for $1.3 billion resolved a few battles in a half-decade war between banks and government mortgage agencies over who was responsible for losses from the mortgage crisis. The bank still has mortgage problems to clear up with the agencies, including a lawsuit linked to the Federal Housing Administration, but Wells Fargo officials believe the worst is over.Wells Fargo avoided many of the worst loans of the subprime era: It did not offer option adjustable-rate mortgages, for instance. But when it acquired Wachovia in 2008, the bank inherited a $120 billion portfolio of ""Pick-A-Pay"" mortgages where borrowers could defer payments on their loans. Those loans have suffered big losses.One of the reasons for banks being so cautious in mortgage lending now is that Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and the FHA have been pressing lenders to buy back home loans that went bad after the crisis. The agencies guaranteed the loans, and argued that the banks overstated the mortgages' quality, or made mistakes like omitting required documents.Banks feel that the agencies were using trivial mistakes as a club to pressure banks to buy back loans.

27,"   By Peter Rudegeair and Michelle Conlin  Wells Fargo & Co, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, is tiptoeing back into subprime home loans again.The bank is looking for opportunities to stem its revenue decline as overall mortgage lending volume plunges. It believes it has worked through enough of its crisis-era mortgage problems, particularly with U.S. home loan agencies, to be comfortable extending credit to some borrowers with higher credit risks.The small steps from Wells Fargo could amount to a big change for the mortgage market. After the subprime mortgage bust brought the banking system to the brink of collapse in the financial crisis, banks have shied away from making home loans to anyone but the safest of consumers.Any loosening of credit standards could boost housing demand from borrowers who have been forced to sit out the recovery in home prices in the past couple of years, but could also stoke fears that U.S. lenders will make the same mistakes that had triggered the crisis.So far few other big banks seem poised to follow Wells Fargo's lead, but some smaller companies outside the banking system, such as Citadel Servicing Corp, are already ramping up their subprime lending. To avoid the taint associated with the word ""subprime,"" lenders are calling their loans ""another chance mortgages"" or ""alternative mortgage programs.""And lenders say they are much stricter about the loans than before the crisis, when lending standards were so lax that many borrowers did not have to provide any proof of income. Borrowers must often make high down payments and provide detailed information about income, work histories and bill payments.Wells Fargo in recent weeks started targeting customers that can meet strict criteria, including demonstrating their ability to repay the loan and having a documented and reasonable explanation for why their credit scores are subprime.It is looking at customers with credit scores as low as 600. Its prior limit was 640, which is often seen as the cutoff point between prime and subprime borrowers. U.S. credit scores range from 300 to 850.Lenders remain cautious in part because of financial reform rules. Under the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, mortgage borrowers must meet eight strict criteria including earning enough income and having relatively low debt. If the borrower does not meet those hurdles and later defaults on a mortgage, he or she can sue the lender and argue the loan should never have been made in the first place.Those kinds of rules have helped build a wall between prime and subprime borrowers. Lenders have been courting consumers who are legally easier to serve, and avoiding those with weaker credit scores and other problems. Subprime borrowers accounted for 0.3 percent of new home loans in October 2013, compared with an average of 29 percent for the 12 months ended February 2004, according to Mark Fleming, the chief economist of CoreLogic.With Wells Fargo looking at loans to borrowers with weaker credit, ""we believe the wall has begun to come down,"" wrote Paul Miller, a bank analyst at FBR Capital Markets, in a research note.Lenders have an ample incentive to try reaching further down the credit spectrum now. Rising mortgage rates since the middle of last year are expected to reduce total U.S. mortgage lending in 2014 by 36 percent to $1.12 trillion, the Mortgage Bankers Association forecasts, due to a big drop in refinancings. Some subprime lending can help banks, but it may also help the economy. In September 2012, then Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said housing had been the missing piston in the U.S. recovery.A recent report from think tank the Urban Institute and Moody's Analytics argued that a full recovery in the housing market ""will only happen if there is stronger demand from first-time homebuyers. And we will not see the demand needed among this group if access to mortgage credit remains as tight as it is today.""Subprime mortgages were at the center of the financial crisis, but many lenders believe that done with proper controls, the risks can be managed and the business can generate big profits.MAKING UP WITH THE AGENCIES For Wells Fargo, one of the critical factors in the new strategy was its clearing up of disputes with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, said Franklin Codel, Wells Fargo's head of mortgage production in Des Moines, Iowa. The 2013 settlements for $1.3 billion resolved a few battles in a half-decade war between banks and government mortgage agencies over who was responsible for losses from the mortgage crisis.The bank still has mortgage problems to clear up with the agencies, including a lawsuit linked to the Federal Housing Administration, but Wells Fargo officials believe the worst is over. Wells Fargo avoided many of the worst loans of the subprime era: It did not offer option adjustable-rate mortgages, for instance. But when it acquired Wachovia in 2008, the bank inherited a $120 billion portfolio of ""Pick-A-Pay"" mortgages where borrowers could defer payments on their loans. Those loans have suffered big losses.One of the reasons for banks being so cautious in mortgage lending now is that Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and the FHA have been pressing lenders to buy back home loans that went bad after the crisis. The agencies guaranteed the loans, and argued that the banks overstated the mortgages' quality, or made mistakes like omitting required documents.Banks feel that the agencies were using trivial mistakes as a club to pressure banks to buy back loans. But after its settlements, Wells Fargo is more confident about the underwriting flaws the agencies consider material and the quality of the documentation needed to avoid such costly battles.""As things become clearer and we are more comfortable with our own processes and controls, it gets easier"" to extend more credit, Codel said.Still, Wells Fargo isn't just opening up the spigots.

29,"   By Jason Lange | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Feb 18 U.S. homebuilder confidence suffered its largest one-month drop ever in February, heightening concerns that recent signs of weakness in the economy reflect deeper problems than the severe weather that has gripped much of the country.The National Association of Home Builders said on Tuesday its Housing Market Index plunged by 10 points to 46 in February , with a majority of builders seeing market conditions as poor.The NAHB, which produces the index together with U.S. bank Wells Fargo, said cold temperatures kept potential home buyers out of the market across much of the country.But the trade group said high costs were also holding back the housing industry, and the data adds to worries the U.S. economy might actually be loosing momentum following a year of break-out growth.Poor weather usually drags on growth only temporarily as businesses and consumers put off purchases. If the recent slowdown in the economy is weather related, economists expect that the trend will reverse once temperatures turn higher and spur consumers to get back to spending. ""This report will keep alive concerns in the markets that the weakening in the data recently is not just due to weather,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, an economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York.Worries over the outlook for the economy have grown since reports showed weak hiring across the economy in December and January, when much of the country experienced unusually frigid temperatures.Now signs of economic weakness are persisting into February. Another report on Tuesday showed a gauge of manufacturing in New York state slowed in February.The New York Federal Reserve Bank's Empire State general business conditions index fell to 4.48 from 12.51 the month before, which was a 20-month high. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a reading of 9.0. The survey of manufacturing plants in New York state is one of the earliest monthly guideposts to U.S. factory conditions. Investors were caught off guard by the NAHB report, which marked the first time since May that the reading was below the key 50 mark. Readings below 50 mean more builders view market conditions as poor than favorable.The Dow Jones index of housing stocks fell 0.7 percent following the release of the data. All three of the home builders in the S&P 500 index -- Lennar Corp., PulteGroup Inc. and D.R. Horton Inc. -- were more than 1 percent lower. More broadly, prices for U.S. stocks and yields on government debt were little changed.The U.S. housing market has been cooling over much of the last year as the Federal Reserve prepared to wind down its bond-buying stimulus program. Expectations the program would come to an end have pushed borrowing costs higher.Builders also are concerned that the industry can't keep up with demand. While this points to some underlying health in the sector, it also is a factor limiting the supply of homes, which helps push up prices and could put home out of reach for some buyers.""Clearly, constraints on the supply chain for building materials, developed lots and skilled workers are making builders worry,"" the NAHB's chief economist, David Crowe, said in the statement from the group. ""The weather also hurt retail     and auto sales and this had a contributing effect on demand for new homes.""",2014-02-18,WFC,"Tue Feb 18, 2014 | 12:33pm EST",WRAPUP 1-More weak U.S. economic data puts cracks in weather theory,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-economy-idUSL2N0LN0Y620140218?type=companyNews
30,"   By Jed Horowitz | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A family brokerage team who had been at Wells Fargo Advisors for more than a decade and manage more than $300 million of assets for wealthy clients resigned on Wednesday to start an independent registered investment advisory firm.Gerald Strid, his sons Erik and Paul and two other brokers folded the Strid Wealth Management Group at Wells' Berwyn, Pennsylvania, branch to form Concentus Wealth Advisors in King of Prussia. The group offers planning services and has discretion to select investment managers for about 150 wealthy families. They plan to continue requiring clients to have a minimum of $1 million of assets and plan to start a family office with a higher minimum.""We were already a long way to feeling independent but we got to the point where it was time to take the last step and be totally objective and transparent (about the practice),"" said Erik Strid, who joined his father's team in 1992 when they were at Merrill Lynch.""There were certain instances where there was a shadow of doubt in clients' minds about where the 'vig' was for the bank,"" he said, using a gambling term for interest kept by the house or lender.The Strids also wanted more equity in their practice and to be less tied to long-term bank stock incentives whose value they cannot control. Despite some incentives that bank-owned brokerage firms give advisers to sell products, the Strid team was successful enough to do what was best for clients without bank interference and benefited from Wells' vast resources, said Erik Strid. Wells Fargo Advisors is a broker-dealer subsidiary of Wells Fargo & Co., the fourth-biggest U.S. bank company.The Strids are part of a small but growing trend of traditional stockbrokers who are becoming independent advisers, typically offering fee-based investment accounts and broad financial planning services.The number of wealth managers who registered as investment advisers grew at an annual rate of 8 percent between 2004 and 2012, while brokers at traditional firms fell an average of 1.2 percent in those years, according to Cerulli Associates, a Boston-based wealth management consulting firm. To help structure their new business, including creating an equity structure to help them expand, the Strids have affiliated with Dynasty Financial Partners, a New York firm founded by former Smith Barney and Citigroup executives that designs technology and investment products for independent advisers.Dynasty helps manage 20 independent wealth management firms with 63 advisers and about $20 billion in assets. It charges a small percentage of the non-cash assets managed by its advisory firms.Concentus, Latin for ""harmony,"" is using Charles Schwab Corp to hold client assets and execute transactions. The group will continue to buy research and tactical strategies from Dorsey Wright & Associates, a Richmond, Virginia-based ""technical"" money manager. It will retain web-based financial planning software from eMoney Advisor, and use Envestnet's reporting and portfolio balancing tools. The Strids were part of a small unit at Wells called ""Profit Formula"" that allows brokers to keep about 75 percent of the revenue they collect from clients but charges them for the costs of running their practices. Most big brokerage firms pay top brokers about 45 percent of the commissions and fees collected from clients, but provide overhead and other services gratis.Wells is not allowing new advisers into Profit Formula, said brokerage spokeswoman Rachelle Rowe, because it has separate ""channels"" to accommodate those who want to be completely independent and others who are full-time employees. Many of the most successful of Wells' more than 15,000 retail brokers are in Profit Formula and tend to move less often, she added.The bank is likely restricting growth of Profit Formula to maintain better risk control, since advisers in the unit have more latitude to manage clients' money, or for reasons related to profit margin but the Strids did not feel pinched by any changes, Erik Strid said.The spokeswoman declined to comment on the Strids or on the number of Profit Formula advisers.

Bray added that the company intends to comply ""fully and transparently"" with Lawsky's letter.Last year, housing finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac expressed concerns about Nationstar's buying servicing rights to $122 billion of mortgage loans, after winning rights to a separate $215 billion mortgage portfolio, according to people familiar with the matter.

The other banks on the deal are JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo & Co and Residential Capital LLC.The report marks the end of the consumer relief portion of the settlement. The rest of the funds were paid to foreclosed borrowers and as cash to the states and the federal government. The banks are still being monitored over their compliance with a third portion of the deal that subjected them to new standards for servicing mortgages.OBAMA'S HOPES At the time the deal was announced, top U.S. officials said it could help 1 million borrowers, and President Barack Obama said it could help turn the page on the housing crisis.But critics said the complicated structure of crediting the banks' efforts to aid consumers could allow the banks to fulfill the settlement obligations through things they would have done anyway -- waiving deficiency judgments or processing short sales, for example. Mortgage bond investors also worried they might end up shouldering many of the costs of the deal.In the first report to audit the banks' full relief efforts under the settlement, Smith said the banks got credit for $20.7 billion in relief to borrowers. They were required to offer $19.1 billion in help under the deal, he said.The majority of that came from loans the banks themselves owned, he said.Banks only get partial credit for some things, such as short sales of homes, so the total amount of aid to borrowers was actually considerably higher, he said. Only around 600,000 families wound up receiving help, fewer than officials initially projected. But Smith said he was still satisfied with the extent to which banks cut borrowers' loan balances.""I viewed our goal as to providing...neutral facts on the basis of which this discussion about dealing with distressed loans could continue,"" Smith said of his report.""We now have a complete picture of what actually happened,"" he said.In statements, Wells Fargo and Bank of America said they were pleased to have provided the relief to customers and have continued to give assistance.

A Citi representative said the bank was pleased Smith found it had fulfilled its consumer relief obligations under the deal.Smith had previously certified that ResCap, which was put through bankruptcy and whose servicing business is now owned by Ocwen Financial Corp, had completed its consumer relief obligations under the deal.SERVICED FOR OTHERS When the deal was announced in 2012, investors in mortgage backed securities worried that many of the mortgages modified were those they ultimately owned, since the banks could get credit for loans they serviced on behalf of others.In fact, the vast majority of all the banks' credit came from addressing loans they owned themselves, Smith said.

52,"   By Jed Horowitz | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Mary Mack, the new retail brokerage boss at Wells Fargo Advisors, has elevated Bob Vorlop to head of products and advice for the firm's more than 11,000 brokers as she fills out her management team.The position is a new one, created when Mack in February split in half the financial services group that creates tools and products for the brokers. At the time, she named Joe Nadreau, 43, to run innovation and business strategy and said the products role would be filled soon.Mack, who became president of the Wells Fargo & Co broker-dealer subsidiary in January following the retirement of long-time brokerage head Danny Ludeman, also plans to name an executive to head a new Mobile and Online Group, a spokeswoman said.Mack previously ran the combined unit at Wells Advisors, which is the third-largest brokerage firm in the United States, as measured by number of financial advisers. Vorlop, 56, oversees brokers' sale of loans and other banking products, an area of growing importance as bank-owned brokers such as Wells, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and UBS Wealth Management Americas attempt to sell products of their parent companies in addition to investment products. His group also oversees investment services and recruiting of brokers and branch managers.Vorlop, who has been with Wells Fargo and predecessor brokerage firms such as Wachovia Securities for 30 years, had most recently run investment and advisory products.Nadreau's innovation and business strategy group creates and manages processes and platforms that brokers use. Nadreau and Vorlop also have joined the broker-dealer's executive committee. Like its competitors, Wells Fargo has been pouring money into new technology to make its products and services more accessible to clients and brokers.

53,"  * Vorlop named to head products and advice* Nadreau running business strategy* Wells' brokerage subsidiary promises brokers technology improvementsBy Jed HorowitzNEW YORK, March 19 Mary Mack, the new retail brokerage boss at Wells Fargo Advisors, has elevated Bob Vorlop to head of products and advice for the firm's more than 11,000 brokers as she fills out her management team.The position is a new one, created when Mack in February split in half the financial services group that creates tools and products for the brokers. At the time, she named Joe Nadreau, 43, to run innovation and business strategy and said the products role would be filled soon. Mack, who became president of the Wells Fargo & Co broker-dealer subsidiary in January following the retirement of long-time brokerage head Danny Ludeman, also plans to name an executive to head a new Mobile and Online Group, a spokeswoman said.Mack previously ran the combined unit at Wells Advisors, which is the third-largest brokerage firm in the United States, as measured by number of financial advisers.Vorlop, 56, oversees brokers' sale of loans and other banking products, an area of growing importance as bank-owned brokers such as Wells, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and UBS Wealth Management Americas attempt to sell products of their parent companies in addition to investment products. His group also oversees investment services and recruiting of brokers and branch managers. Vorlop, who has been with Wells Fargo and predecessor brokerage firms such as Wachovia Securities for 30 years, had most recently run investment and advisory products.Nadreau's innovation and business strategy group creates and manages processes and platforms that brokers use.  Nadreau and Vorlop also have joined the broker-dealer's executive committee. Like its competitors, Wells Fargo has been pouring money into new technology to make its products and services more accessible to clients and brokers. Wells' brokerage group has grown through a series of acquisitions that left it with numerous systems and workstations that did not always communicate effectively.In an internal email to brokers last month, David Kowach, president of the branch-based private client group, said he has heard their complaints about poor technology and inefficient services and is addressing them.

54,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 26 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Support Ratings (SRs)  and Support Rating Floors (SRFs) at '1' and 'A', respectively, for Bank of New  York Mellon Corporation (BK), State Street Corporation (STT), and Wells Fargo &  Company (WFC). The rating actions have been taken in conjunction with a review  of support for banks globally.  BK's, STT's, and WFC's IDRs do not currently incorporate any government support,  and reflect their standalone strengths only. As such, absent a material in  change economic conditions or the companies' stand-alone credit profiles, a  future change to their SRs or SRFs will have no impact on the companies' IDRs. KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATINGS AND SUPPORT RATING FLOORS BK's, STT's, and WFC's current SRs and SRFs reflect Fitch's expectation that  there remains an extremely high probability of support from the U.S. government  (rated 'AAA', Rating Outlook Stable) if required. This expectation reflects the  U.S.'s extremely high ability to support its banks especially given its strong  financial flexibility, though propensity is becoming less certain. Specific to  BK, STT, and WFC, our view of support likelihood is based mostly on their  systemic importance in the U.S., their global interconnectedness given their  size and operations in global capital markets, significant deposit market share  and their positions as key providers of financial services to the U.S. economy.  BK's, STT's, and WFC's IDRs and senior debt ratings do not benefit from support  because their VRs are all above their SRF. However, in Fitch's view, there is a clear intention to reduce support for  G-SIFIs in the U.S., as demonstrated by the Dodd Frank Act (DFA) and progress  regulators have made on implementing the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA).  The FDIC has proposed its single point of entry (SPOE) strategy and further  initiatives are demonstrating the U.S. government's progress to eliminate state  support for U.S. banks going forward, which increases the likelihood of senior  debt losses if its banks run afoul of solvency assessments. RATING SENSITVITIES - SUPPORT RATINGS AND SUPPORT RATING FLOORS The SRs and SRFs are sensitive to progress made in finalizing the SPOE strategy  and any additional regulatory initiatives that may be imposed on the G-SIFIs,  including debt thresholds at the holding company. Fitch's assessment of  continuing support for U.S. G-SIFIs has to some extent relied upon the  feasibility of OLA implementation rather than its enactment into law (when DFA  passed). Hurdles that remain include the resolution of how cross-border  derivative acceleration/termination provisions are handled and that there is  sufficient contingent capital at the holding company to recapitalize without  requiring government assistance. Fitch expects that the SPOE strategy and regulatory action to ensure sufficient  contingent capital will be finalized in the near term, but regardless of its  finalization, Fitch believes that sufficient regulatory progress continues to be  made over the ratings time horizon. Therefore, Fitch expects to revise BK's,  STT's, and WFC's SRs to '5' and SRFs to 'No Floor' within the next one to two  years, likely to be some point in late 2014 or in 1H15. Absent a material in change economic conditions or the companies' stand-alone  credit profiles, a revision of the SRFs to 'No Floor' would mean no change to  BK's, STT's, or WFC's Long-term IDRs and debt ratings because their viability  ratings are all above their SRFs. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings. All other ratings are unaffected.

55,"  (Adds more details throughout about the SEC's money market fund plan)By Sarah N. LynchMarch 26 U.S. securities regulators are inching closer to completing new rules for money market funds, though no final decision on how to proceed has been made just yet, according to a person familiar with the matter.The Securities and Exchange Commission staff in charge of the rulewriting has been meeting with the agency's five commissioners, circulating some documents that highlight potential courses of actions and sounding them out to get their thoughts, the person said.The SEC is still actively eyeing a plan that would force prime institutional money market funds to abandon their stable $1 per-share net asset value and float their share price.In response to some complaints from the industry, the SEC is also exploring whether to make some changes from its initial proposal that could effectively expand the number of money market funds that would be exempt from a floating net asset value, the person added.The SEC has been exploring ways to reform the $2.6 trillion money market fund industry as a direct response to the financial crisis.In 2008, exposures to Lehman Brothers caused a large prime institutional fund known as the Reserve Primary Fund to have its net asset value dip below $1, an event known as ""breaking the buck.""Spooked investors rushed to get their money out, and the U.S. government ultimately stepped in to prop up the money market fund industry until the panic subsided. The SEC's proposal, first released last summer, is aimed at preventing similar runs.In addition to proposing a floating NAV for prime funds, the plan also contemplates an alternative which would permit fund boards to impose liquidity fees and redemption gates during times of stress.The SEC could potentially adopt one of the two options alone or in combination.The source added that the proposal for gates and fees are also still on the table as well. Earlier this week, the SEC released four new economic analyses on money market funds that it is using to help inform a final rule and asked the public to submit feedback on the studies.SEC Republican Commissioner Michael Piwowar said on Wednesday that he is advocating internally for the SEC to allow funds to choose which option they prefer.""My idea is, rather than us choosing for everybody, why don't we allow for both options to be offered and then investors can choose which one they want?"" Piwowar said on the sidelines of an SEC event.""I call it the investor choice model, or the belts or suspenders model,"" he added. It is unclear if his idea could gain traction. A majority of the five commissioners must agree before a rule can be adopted.RETAIL EXEMPTION EYED As part of the SEC's internal discussions, staff is discussing making changes that would broaden an exemption for retail money market funds from having to float their share price.Retail funds were always supposed to be exempted from the floating NAV plan because they are considered less at risk for runs. But many in the industry have said that how the SEC defined retail is problematic.In October, nine fund management companies including Blackrock, Fidelity, Vanguard and Wells Fargo  proposed an alternative definition of retail.Under the SEC's plan, a fund would be considered retail if it prohibits a shareholder from redeeming more than $1 million per business day.The nine companies have urged the SEC to instead define a retail fund as one that ""limits beneficial ownership interest to natural persons"" such as individuals who are investing in money funds through individual accounts or retirement accounts.The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on the SEC's internal deliberations concerning broadening the retail exemption.

56,"   By Peter Rudegeair | April 1  April 1 Wells Fargo & Co said on Tuesday that it agreed to issue and service credit cards for retailer Dillard's Inc, the latest move by the fourth-largest U.S. bank to boost its card business.Under a 10-year agreement likely to begin in the fourth quarter of 2014, Wells Fargo will offer private label and co-branded credit cards on behalf of Dillard's, taking over from General Electric Co's consumer finance unit. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.Expanding the size of Wells Fargo's credit card business has been a priority for top executives, who have focused on getting more of their existing retail customers to open accounts and use their cards more frequently.The bank has some success to show for it: 37 percent of its retail households had a Wells Fargo credit card at the end of 2013, compared with 27 percent at the end of 2011. But the deal with Dillard's, a Little Rock, Arkansas-based department store operator with fiscal 2014 revenue of about $6.7 billion, illustrates that the bank can also use its relationships with existing commercial customers to boost that division.Dillard's is a large banking customer of Wells Fargo, and issuing cards branded for specific retailers who do other business with the bank is a natural way for the credit card unit to expand, said Tom Wolfe, Wells Fargo's executive vice president for consumer credit solutions. The San Francisco-based bank has lagged rivals like Citigroup Inc. and Capital One Financial Corp in issuing these private label cards, according to data from the Nilson Report, an industry publication. But Wells Fargo hopes to win more of this business in the future.""This is one area that we'd like to spend some more time expanding,"" Wolfe said. Wells Fargo is not alone in wanting to boost its private label business. GE's consumer finance unit, part of which filed for an initial public offering in March under the name Synchrony Financial, said in a March 13 securities filing that ""the competition for partners is intense and becoming more competitive."" Synchrony listed Wells Fargo as one of its primary competitors in the private label credit card business.Another area that Wells Fargo has identified as one where it is ""clearly underrepresented"" in credit cards is among the affluent.The bank announced a partnership with American Express Co  in August to provide more competitive rewards and benefits to wealthy consumers. A full-scale launch of those products is set to occur in the first half of 2014.

57,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Wells Fargo & Co failed to persuade a U.S. judge to dismiss a lawsuit accusing it of mismanaging a collateralized debt obligation vehicle created by WestLB AG, a state-owned German bank that was dissolved after the 2008 financial crisis.While dismissing several claims, U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan in Manhattan said Wells Fargo must face claims by House of Europe Funding I Ltd, a Cayman Islands-based CDO issuer, that its oversight led to losses that could reach $163 million. The decision was made public on Tuesday, and is dated March 31.Created by WestLB in 2003, House of Europe accused Wells Fargo, as trustee and collateral administrator, and Collineo Asset Management GmbH, a German asset manager, of taking too much risk by allowing it to invest excessively in other kinds of CDOs at least six times from April 2006 to July 2007.According to the complaint, most of the disputed assets have defaulted, causing $143 million of losses and $20 million of expected future losses for House of Europe and its investors. Erste Abwicklungsanstalt (EAA), a German agency created to wind down WestLB, was also a plaintiff. Sullivan ruled that House of Europe's allegations sufficed to allow a breach of contract claim against Wells Fargo.He also said that allegations that Wells Fargo concealed the true nature of the investments by misreporting them supported an inference at this stage of the case that the San Francisco-based bank might have acted with ""gross negligence.""Sullivan also allowed House of Europe to pursue part of its case against Collineo, and dismissed much of EAA's case. The lawsuit was filed in January 2013. Jonathan Pickhardt, a partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan representing House of Europe and EAA, said: ""We are pleased that the court upheld our central claim seeking to hold Wells Fargo responsible for its repeated breaches of provisions intended to protect House of Europe I and its investors.""Wells Fargo spokesman Ancel Martinez declined to comment. The bank is the fourth-largest in the United States by assets. Demian Ordway, a lawyer at Holwell Shuster & Goldberg representing Collineo, said: ""We're very happy with the result, and are confident that HOE's remaining claim against Collineo will ultimately be dismissed.""WestLB ceased operations in 2012.The case is House of Europe Funding I Ltd et al v.

He will be succeeded by Chief Financial Officer Tim Sloan.The bank's wholesale banking group provides lending and services such as treasury management and insurance to businesses with annual sales in excess of $20 million.Taking over Sloan's role will be John Shrewsberry, the head of Wells Fargo Securities, a division within wholesale banking that includes the bank's capital markets, sales and trading, and investment banking businesses.""Today's appointments represent a natural evolution of executive responsibilities at our company,"" said Chief Executive John Stumpf in a news release. ""They also demonstrate the deep bench of high-caliber leaders at Wells Fargo and the value of rotating them into different roles to effect seamless leadership transitions."" The bank declined to make Hoyt, Sloan or Shrewsberry available for interviews.Hoyt, 58, managed the wholesale banking group for 16 years and oversaw much of the 2008 integration following Wells Fargo's acquisition of Wachovia.Certain executives, including members of the bank's operating committee like Hoyt, have a mandatory retirement age of 65.

But the deal with Dillard's, a Little Rock, Arkansas-based department store operator with fiscal 2014 revenue of about $6.7 billion, illustrates that the bank can also use its relationships with existing commercial customers to boost that division.Dillard's is a large banking customer of Wells Fargo, and issuing cards branded for specific retailers who do other business with the bank is a natural way for the credit card unit to expand, said Tom Wolfe, Wells Fargo's executive vice president for consumer credit solutions. The San Francisco-based bank has lagged rivals like Citigroup Inc. (C.N) and Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N) in issuing these private label cards, according to data from the Nilson Report, an industry publication. But Wells Fargo hopes to win more of this business in the future.""This is one area that we'd like to spend some more time expanding,"" Wolfe said. Wells Fargo is not alone in wanting to boost its private label business. GE's consumer finance unit, part of which filed for an initial public offering in March under the name Synchrony Financial, said in a March 13 securities filing that ""the competition for partners is intense and becoming more competitive."" Synchrony listed Wells Fargo as one of its primary competitors in the private label credit card business.Another area that Wells Fargo has identified as one where it is ""clearly underrepresented"" in credit cards is among the affluent.The bank announced a partnership with American Express Co (AXP.N) in August to provide more competitive rewards and benefits to wealthy consumers. A full-scale launch of those products is set to occur in the first half of 2014.(Reporting by Peter Rudegeair; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)",2014-04-02,WFC,"Tue Apr 1, 2014 | 8:00pm EDT",Wells Fargo extends credit card push in deal with Dillard's,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-wells-fargo-credit-cards-idUSBREA3100020140402?type=companyNews

66,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 11 (Fitch) Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) has reported another  quarter of record earnings, with net income up 5% sequentially in 1Q'14. The  results are impressive, according to Fitch Ratings, given the low interest rate  environment and still tenuous loan demand.  Earnings were supported by lower credit costs, controlled expenses, and higher  trading results, partially offset by modest compression in spread income. The 5%  sequential improvement in earnings was primarily driven by a one-time tax  benefit. Excluding this item, Fitch estimates that adjusted ROA was  approximately 143bps during the quarter, as compared to last quarter's ROA of  148bps. Fitch views these results favorably and as consistent with WFC's credit  profile, with ratings that remain among the highest in the world.  Revenue growth remains challenging for the entire industry, and the revenues for  WFC were slightly down on a linked-quarter basis. Lower spread income,  reflecting two fewer days in the quarter, was offset by improved noninterest  income. The net interest margin (NIM) continued to contract a further 7bps in  1Q'14, reflecting weaker loan yields and a bottoming out of funding costs.  Overall noninterest income was up roughly 2% on a linked-quarter basis primarily  aided by a 41% increase in net gains on trading activities, debt securities, and  equity investments. These revenues combined with investment banking comprised a  relatively manageable 8% of total revenues in 1Q'14, the contribution of more  volatile capital markets activities that is well below some of WFC's large bank  peers. Lower services charges, mortgage revenues, and investment banking  revenues partially offset the favorable trading results.  Despite the expected and sizeable drop-off in refinancings, mortgage results  were once again resilient in 1Q'14. Mortgage originations declined a further 28%  in the quarter, roughly in line with peer results; however, total mortgage  banking noninterest income fell only 4% from the prior quarter due primarily to  higher MSR results, net of hedging. Production income declined 34%, reflecting  lower origination volumes. While mortgage banking revenues are down nearly 50%  from a year ago, it appears as though the level has stabilized or is close to  stabilizing.  Expenses were down slightly on a sequential basis. Personnel expenses were  higher in 1Q'14 reflecting seasonally higher incentive compensation and employee  benefit expenses, which more than offset by lower equipment, professional  services, and advertising expenses.  WFC reported a smaller reserve release on a sequential basis of $500 million as  compared to $600 million last quarter. Net charge-offs (NCOs) reflecting  continuing asset quality improvement, declining to just 41bps, well below WFC's  historical loss history of around 100bps. WFC expects future reserve releases,  absent a significant deterioration in economic conditions. Given relatively weak  loan demand (2% on linked-quarter annualized basis), WFC's provisioning needs  for loan growth appear relatively low at this point.  Estimated Common Equity Tier 1 under Basel III Advanced Approach was solid  10.04% at quarter-end, exceeding the company's internal target of 9%. WFC's  received no objection to its capital request under CCAR, which included an  anticipated increase in the dividend to $0.35 from $0.30 per quarter and higher  anticipated share repurchases in 2014. WFC's previously disclosed total payout  ratio target is between 50% and 65% of earnings.

67,"   By Peter Rudegeair and Anil D'Silva  Wells Fargo & Co, the biggest U.S. mortgage lender, reported a higher-than-expected 14 percent rise in first-quarter net profit, as a series of cost cuts and one-time gains helped the bank offset the lowest volume of home loans it made in five-and-a-half years.The bank, the most profitable in the United States in 2013, has been hurt in recent quarters by declining demand for mortgage refinancing, as lending rates have risen.Income from mortgage banking fell by 46 percent to $1.5 billion from the same quarter last year. Wells Fargo's new home loans fell by two-thirds to $36 billion in the quarter from $109 billion a year earlier, the lowest since the third quarter of 2008, when the housing market was under heavy stress.But a series of one-time items this quarter helped offset much of the decline in the mortgage business. Wells Fargo recorded $847 million in gains on its equity investments, about 7.5 times the $113 million it earned a year earlier.Its tax bill was also $227 million lower as it booked a $423 million benefit from resolving prior disputes with state tax authorities. Overall operating expenses fell 4 percent as it spent less on employee benefits and incentive compensation.Another boost to net income came from the bank dipping into funds set aside to cover soured loans, as the housing market and the overall economy stabilized. The bank released $500 million from these reserves, higher than the $200 million a year ago but less than the $600 million released in the fourth quarter.Without many of these one-time gains, Wells Fargo's results would have missed Wall Street's estimates, according to Citigroup Inc banking analyst Keith Horowitz. JPMorgan Chase & Co, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, reported Friday profits fell 19 percent from a year earlier thanks to weaker-than-expected bond trading and mortgage banking revenue.Wells Fargo's shares rose 1.5 percent in afternoon trading at $48.41. JPMorgan Chase shares fell 3.3 percent to $55.48. The KBW index of bank stocks was down nearly 1 percent.Net income for Wells Fargo's common shareholders rose to $5.60 billion, or $1.05 per share, in the quarter, from $4.93 billion, or 92 cents per share, a year earlier.Analysts on average had expected the bank to earn 97 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

""Every quarter has a different complexion."" There were some indications in Wells Fargo's results that mortgage banking might be rising out of the doldrums. The bank had $27 billion of mortgage applications in the pipeline at the end of the quarter, up slightly from $25 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. Chief Executive John Stumpf told analysts on a conference call that ""the housing recovery remained on track and should benefit from the spring buying season.""Wells Fargo's loan book also showed signs of life. Total lending rose 4 percent to $826.4 billion thanks to a 7 percent increase in commercial and industrial loans and an 11 percent increase in auto loans since the first quarter of 2013.At the same time, the company is experiencing historically low loan losses. Its net charge-off rate was 0.41 percent in the latest quarter, versus 0.72 percent a year ago.

69,"   By Jed Horowitz | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Strong sales of fee-based managed investment accounts by Wells Fargo & Co. brokers fueled a 41 percent jump in net income in the bank's ""Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement"" unit during the first quarter.The fourth-largest U.S. bank company, which emphasizes the diversity of its business model, said Friday that growth in managed account advisory fees and other market-sensitive revenue generated $10 billion of noninterest income for Wells in the three months ending March 31.The fees, which also included trading and investment gains in the bank's own portfolio, helped offset declines in mortgage lending. Wells is the biggest home loan lender in the U.S.The wealth businesses remain Wells Fargo's smallest, with its $475 million of profit representing 7.8 percent of the $6.1 billion of net income from the bank's three business segments. Community, or branch banking, generated $3.8 billion of net income in the first quarter, and profit from wholesale banking, or loans and investment banking services to corporations, was $1.7 billion.Like Bank of America's Merrill Lynch, UBS Wealth Management Americas and other brokerage firms owned by big banks, Wells Fargo Advisors has been urging brokers to sell loans, insurance and other bank products and services to supplement traditional investment products. The average Wells Fargo wealth sector client had 10.4 products or services from the bank as of the end of February, a greater ""cross-sell"" rate than in any other sector of the bank. Bank-owned brokerages also have been urging brokers to convert more clients to fee accounts, which are charged as a percentage of assets in the accounts, because they are more stable and tend to be more profitable than traditional commission-based accounts.More than 80 percent of Wells Fargo's wealth management and brokerage revenue now come from recurring revenue such as fees, rather than unpredictable commissions, the company's chief financial officer said on a conference call with analysts.Brokerage Loans Managed account assets at Wells Fargo Advisors soared 19 percent in the first quarter to $388 billion from a year earlier, and 4 percent from the last quarter of 2013. That beat the 1.3 percent rise in the Standard & Poor's 500 index during the first quarter, indicating that brokers actively attracted fee-based assets from existing and new customers.Client loan balances in Wells's three wealth businesses, which also include financial planning for affluent investors and retirement services for companies and individuals, jumped 14 percent from last year to an average of $50 billion during the first quarter. Wealth sector clients also added $156 billion of low-cost deposits to their banking accounts. Improving credit quality among U.S. consumers helped Wells write down fewer loans last quarter, and seeped into the Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement unit, which focuses on loans to people with $250,000 or more to invest. It released $8 million from its reserve for credit losses to the bank's earnings, following a $27 million release in the fourth quarter of 2013.Total client assets at the brokerage unit inched up 1 percent from last year's fourth quarter and 8 percent from a year earlier to $1.4 trillion.

Income from mortgage banking fell to $1.5 billion from $2.8 billion in the first quarter of 2013.For the week ending April 4, applications for refinancing fell to their lowest share of total mortgage applications since July 2009, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.Wells Fargo's new home loans fell to $36 billion in the quarter from $109 billion a year earlier and $50 billion in the fourth quarter.

86,"  (Recasts headline; adds guidance on mortgage business)By Peter RudegeairMay 20 Wells Fargo & Co plans to return as much as 75 percent of its profit to shareholders, up from 34 percent in 2013, a top executive said on Tuesday.Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said at the bank's 2014 investor day that Wells Fargo was looking to pay out between 55 percent and 75 percent of net income as dividends and stock repurchases, minus new share issuances. Shrewsberry did not say when the bank expected to meet the new goal for this measure, which it calls ""net payout ratio.""Shrewsberry said he was confident the bank could meet the updated targets because it already generated strong earnings and was operating at its long-term capital requirements.At its 2012 investor day, the bank targeted a total payout ratio, which did not subtract new share issuance, of 50 percent to 65 percent. Its total payout ratio in 2013 was 55 percent. Any increase in dividends or share buybacks must be approved annually by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the bank's board of directors. In March, the Fed did not object to Wells Fargo's proposal to increase its quarterly dividend to 35 cents a share from 30 cents and to raise the number of shares it can repurchase.The bank said it was keeping its targets for a 1.30 percent to 1.60 percent return on assets and a 12 percent to 15 percent return on equity. Wells Fargo also did not change the target of its efficiency ratio, or revenue relative to costs, from a range of 55 percent to 59 percent.Separately, Wells Fargo Home Mortgage president Mike Heid said he expects second-quarter mortgage volumes to be higher than the $36 billion of home loans the bank extended in the first quarter. He added that he expects the mortgage production business to be profitable in 2014, as it has been in every year since 1990.Like many of its peers, Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, has made fewer home loans over the past few quarters as higher interest rates crimped demand. Wells Fargo's profit forecast for mortgage lending contrasts with that of JPMorgan Chase & Co, the second-largest U.S. mortgage lender. At that bank's February investor day, executives told investors to expect mortgage production income to be negative before taxes in 2014.JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon called mortgages ""the most painful business ever"" at that conference because of losses on crisis-era loans and litigation.Wells Fargo consumer lending chief Avid Modjtabai, without identifying JPMorgan or Dimon by name, said she took issue with a competitor's characterization of the business as the most painful ever.""We fully disagree with that comment,"" Modjtabai said, adding that the bank has been committed to extending home loans in every single business cycle.

89,"   By Jed Horowitz | NEW YORK  NEW YORK May 20 Robert J. Wood, a financial adviser with Wells Fargo Advisors, said on Tuesday he jumped with two other brokers to Raymond James Financial in Richmond, Va., last Friday because of frustration over pressure to sell Wells Fargo & Co bank products.His team, which includes Robert J. Wood, Jr., adviser Carlton Brown and an assistant, last year produced about $2 million of revenue, primarily from fees for managing stock and bond investments for about 200 client accounts, according to Raymond James.Wood, 73, had been with Wells Fargo Advisors and predecessor brokerage Wachovia Securities, since 2003, the year Wachovia's bank parent bought a majority stake in Prudential Financial's  Prudential Bache Securities.""There was no bank pressure to do product when we were Wachovia, and now there is,"" Wood said in a telephone interview with Reuters. Wood said his chief complaint is that the team had to forsake part of its potential bonus in the last two years that was tied to making loans. He balked at making loan referrals in part because lenders at the bank tried to take credit for having the prime relationship with the client, he said.""Our (financial adviser) comp is very generous, and is based on best practices for doing what's right for clients,"" a Wells Fargo Advisors spokeswoman said in an email. Wood also was upset because Wells failed to register him and some other brokers in Florida, where he lives for more than half the year. He was fined $22,500 in 2012 for operating in the state without a license. Wells paid, Wood said, but he now has a mark on his brokerage record at the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.Wood, who began his brokerage career at E.F. Hutton & Co. in 1985, said his son is now managing partner of the team. They chose St. Petersburg, Florida-based Raymond James because it is a more traditional brokerage firm that gives its advisers more autonomy than Wells, he said.

90,"  May 20 Wells Fargo & Co plans to return as much as 75 percent of its profits to shareholders, up from 34 percent in 2013, a top executive said on Tuesday.Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said at the bank's 2014 investor day that Wells Fargo was looking to pay out between 55 percent and 75 percent of net income as dividends and stock repurchases, minus new share issuances. Shrewsberry did not say when the bank expected to meet the new goal for this measure, which it calls net payout ratio.Shrewsberry said he was confident the bank could meet the updated targets because it already generated a lot of earnings and was operating at its long-term capital requirements. At its 2012 investor day, the bank targeted a total payout ratio, which did not subtract new share issuance, of 50 percent to 65 percent. Its total payout ratio in 2013 was 55 percent. Any increase in dividends or share buybacks must be approved annually by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the bank's board of directors. In March, the Fed did not object to Wells Fargo's proposal to increase its quarterly dividend to 35 cents a share from 30 cents and to raise the number of shares it can repurchase. The bank said it was keeping its targets for a 1.30 percent to 1.60 percent return on assets and a 12 percent to 15 percent return on equity.Wells Fargo also did not change the target of its efficiency ratio, or revenue relative to costs, from a range of 55 percent to 59 percent.

93,"   By Tony Jimenez | VIRGINIA WATER England  VIRGINIA WATER England Former world number one Rory McIlroy ended a tumultuous week by firing a six-under-par 66 in the final round to score a fairytale victory in the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth on Sunday.The Northern Irishman, who broke up with tennis-playing fiancee Caroline Wozniacki a few days ago, finished with a 14-under total of 274 after a remarkable day of ebbing and flowing at the European Tour's flagship event.Ireland's Shane Lowry carded a 68 to take second place on 275 while Dane Thomas Bjorn, who went into the last round holding a five-stroke lead, ballooned to a 75 and had to be content with a share of third spot alongside twice former winner Luke Donald (70).On a topsy-turvy day of glorious sunshine during which the swirling winds and tricky pin positions caused the lead to constantly change hands, it was McIlroy who held his nerve the best.A succession of long putts were holed by the leading players and Donald twice chipped in over the closing stages but the 25-year-old McIlroy ultimately took the tournament by the scruff of the neck with four birdies in the last nine holes.The victory was McIlroy's sixth on the European Tour and his first on the mainland. He had previously triumphed twice in Dubai, twice in the United States and once in Hong Kong.The world number 10 ended his campaign in stylish fashion, birdying the par-five 17th and 18th and he threw his ball high into the grandstands after converting a four-foot putt on the final green.""To win here at Wentworth, at the flagship event, I couldn't have asked for anything more,"" said McIlroy at the presentation ceremony after pocketing the first prize of 644,411 pounds ($1.09 million).""I played well this week and I knew coming here I was playing well because I've had a few top-10s in the States.  ""I struggled a bit on Friday,"" said the 25-year-old in reference to his second-round 71, ""but I played great over the weekend.""Twice former major winner McIlroy has never looked upon Wentworth as a happy hunting ground.MISSED CUTS The 2011 U.S. Open and 2012 U.S. PGA champion missed the cut three times in his previous six starts and had a best finish of fifth in 2009. McIlroy began the last day seven shots adrift of Bjorn but went on to equal the biggest final-round comeback in the 60-year history of the BMW PGA Championship.""I was a little fortunate today because some of the guys ahead of me made some mistakes and I took advantage,"" he said.""My caddie set me a target of 15-under to get to. I didn't quite get there but 14-under was enough and I'm happy with that.""I really wanted to win before the second major of the season,"" said McIlroy of next month's U.S. Open, ""and I couldn't have asked for a better way to prepare.""Lowry was three strokes clear of the field after 12 holes but the 13th proved unlucky for the Irishman as he racked up a double-bogey six. He then gained some consolation by sinking a monster putt at the 18th.""I feel very unlucky,"" said Lowry. ""I felt I hit some great shots coming in ... but to hole the putt on the last and to finish second on my own is really nice.""Rory is definitely one of the best golfers I've ever played with and I've been lucky enough to play a lot of golf with him.  He's had his struggles over the last couple of years and I'm delighted for him.""Donald chipped in from the off the green at the 13th and 16th but he and playing partner Bjorn were undone on the front nine where they both slumped to costly double-bogey sevens at the sixth.World number three Henrik Stenson, who could go top of the rankings depending on incumbent Adam Scott's performance at the Colonial Invitational in Texas later on Sunday, shot a closing 70 to finish tied seventh on 280.($1 = 0.5938 British Pounds) (Editing by Ed Osmond)",2014-05-25,WFC,"Sun May 25, 2014 | 2:32pm EDT",McIlroy ends tumultuous week by winning Wentworth showpiece,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-golf-european-winner-idUSKBN0E50QY20140525?type=companyNews

97,"  Wells Fargo & Co lost its bid to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the city of Los Angeles, which accuses the bank of predatory lending practices that targeted minority borrowers and led to the loss of property tax revenue.U.S. District Judge Otis Wright II ruled on Wednesday that the city's claims were adequate for the case to proceed.In the lawsuit, Los Angeles said the bank had engaged in discriminatory lending practices since at least 2004 by making loans to minority borrowers that they could not afford, resulting in a disproportionate rise in the number of foreclosures.In the complaint filed by the city against Wells Fargo, former employees of the San Francisco-based bank described how the predatory loans were specifically marketed to minorities and minority communities in the city.

105,"   By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday rejected Wells Fargo & Co's WFC.N attempt to avoid litigation over government allegations of misconduct related to home mortgage loans issued by the Federal Housing Administration.A unanimous three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the bank's participation in a $25 billion settlement with the government over foreclosure abuses did not address the claims in the separate civil case brought by the U.S. Attorney’s office in Manhattan concerning the origination and underwriting of loans.""We are disappointed with the appellate court’s ruling,"" Wells Fargo spokesman Ancel Martinez said in a statement. ""We look forward to presenting our case in support of our longstanding record of responsible lending."" Wells Fargo had asked a federal district court in Washington, D.C., to enforce the 2012 settlement, which had been negotiated by the Justice Department. The bank said the claims made in the more recent New York lawsuit should be barred in light of the settlement. The appeals court on Tuesday upheld a district judge's decision to deny the bank's motion. The appeals court, in Tuesday's unsigned opinion, said the settlement language clearly allowed the separate claims to be made.The case is United States v.

110,"   By Dena Aubin | NEW YORK, June 16  NEW YORK, June 16 JPMorgan Chase & Co  has been sued by the city of Miami, accusing the bank of predatory mortgage lending in minority neighborhoods that allegedly caused a wave of foreclosures during the last decade's housing crisis.The lawsuit, filed on Friday in federal court in Florida, said the country's largest bank engaged in a continuous practice of discriminatory mortgage lending since at least 2004, violating the U.S. Fair Housing Act.After issuing high-cost loans to minorities in the years before the housing crisis, JPMorgan later refused to refinance the loans on the same terms as it extended to whites, leading to defaults and foreclosures, the complaint said.The lawsuit came just weeks after the city of Los Angeles filed similar claims against JPMorgan, seeking to recoup damages for lost tax revenue and increased city services needed in blighted neighborhoods. ""The Miami City Attorney's claims are baseless and stand contrary to our long record of providing affordable housing to low- to moderate-income families across the region,"" JPMorgan spokesman Jason Lobo said. The bank will defend itself against the claims, he said.Wells Fargo & Co, Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Corp also face lawsuits by Los Angeles and Miami for allegedly giving minorities home loans they could not afford, resulting in massive defaults.The banks have contested the claims, saying they have records as responsible lenders. Among major cities, Miami has led the country in foreclosures, and JPMorgan's practices contributed to its problems, Friday's lawsuit alleged.Loans in predominantly minority neighborhoods in Miami were about 4.6 times more likely to result in foreclosure than loans in neighborhoods with a majority of white residents, the lawsuit said. Miami is still being damaged because of the services needed to combat unsafe and dangerous conditions, crime and even gang activity at foreclosed properties, the lawsuit said.Wells Fargo and Citigroup recently lost bids to have their lawsuits tossed.A spokesman for the city of Miami did not immediately return a request for comment.The case is City of Miami v JPMorgan Chase & Co, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida, No 14-cv-22205   (Editing by Will Dunham and Jeffrey Benkoe)",2014-06-16,WFC,"Mon Jun 16, 2014 | 12:13pm EDT",JPMorgan sued by Miami over alleged mortgage discrimination,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-jpmorgan-chase-discrimination-idUSL2N0OX0OX20140616?type=companyNews
111,"   By Douwe Miedema | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Wells Fargo, State Street and JPMorgan Chase & Co are below or almost at minimum capital thresholds expected to be included in a rule still being hammered out by U.S. regulators that's meant to mitigate taxpayer losses in another financial crisis, according to a Reuters analysis.U.S. banks are already required to hold equity equal to about 10 percent of their balance sheet to serve as a shock absorber to cover the risk of a sharp drop in the value of loans, investments and other assets on their books. Banks expect U.S. regulators to require them to hold another 10 percent in bonds with maturities of more than a year and other instruments, as part of the forthcoming rule. Wells Fargo's (WFC.N) loss-absorbing capital stood at 17 percent at the end of last year, State Street's (STT.N) was 18.2 percent and JPMorgan (JPM.N) stood at 19.1 percent, according to a Reuters analysis of eight banks, based on regulatory filings and methodology recently presented by Citigroup.""These are figures which have been circulating,"" said Bernard De Longevialle, a credit analyst at Standard & Poor's. ""The market tends to view these three (banks) as those who would potentially be the most stretched.""Analysts and officials at banks are basing their estimates for the benchmarks partially on discussions with regulators and on wider market assumptions for what would be a reasonable level. The Federal Reserve has typically taken a tougher stance than its counterparts in the European Union.The Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), who are jointly working on the rule, declined to comment.Regulators want creditors - and not just shareholders - to take a hit if a bank lands in trouble, to prevent a repeat of the panic that spread when Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008.The equity requirements that U.S. banks already conform to are in line with recommendations made in the global Basel III accord. The Fed has said it is planning similar requirements for long-term debt instruments that investors buy knowing they might lose all or part of their money. This would double the loss-absorbing capacity of a bank's capital to about 20 percent.Regulators from across the world are also working on such plans, but they still disagree about the details of a common approach they want to present when the G20 largest countries of the world meet at a summit in Brisbane, Australia, in November.DOUBLE THE BUFFERS  The European Union wants banks' loss-absorbing capital to stand at about 18 percent of the balance sheet, and analysts believe that the Fed will come up with a similar number, somewhere between 18 percent and 25 percent.JPMorgan declined to comment. State Street said it had ""an ongoing dialogue with industry participants and regulators over a wide variety of issues"", and that it remained one of the most well-capitalized banks in the United States.Wells Fargo pointed to a May investor day, during which its Treasurer Paul Ackerman said he expected the bank's long-term debt ""to grow a little bit"" to fill any gap. Since the beginning of last year, Wells Fargo has issued more than $11 billion in debt with maturities greater than 10 years.Bank of New York Mellon (BK.N) stood at 23.4 percent, Citigroup (C.N) at 22.8 percent and Bank of America (BAC.N) at 23.2 percent. All numbers are based on regulatory filings as of Dec. 31, 2013.  See graphic: (link.reuters.com/dun22w).The rule is intended to make sure that governments can wind down a failing bank that is considered to pose too much risk to the financial system to go through ordinary bankruptcy, while not burdening the taxpayer. In the U.S., for example, the FDIC has explained how it would go about the exercise, but the plan won't work without the extra buffers.""Banks are more or less asked to keep a capital base ... of 9 to 10 percent of risk-weighted assets, and it's just a simple rule of thumb to say you would have ... debt that would allow to double this amount,"" De Longevialle said.FitchRatings in a recent presentation also assumed a total loss-absorbing capacity of 20 percent.MORE RULES Banks may not have too much trouble in raising more long-term debt depending on the exact details of the Fed's requirement, analysts said, particularly if there is a long transition period. Questions about the levels and about what instruments would count towards the total add to banks' anticipation about a long list of new rules that haven’t been fully implemented, or that regulators are still writing.The Fed alone is working on four more rules: to raise more capital for systemically important banks, to require banks to invest in assets they can easily sell, to balance the maturities of assets and liabilities, and to make the short-term funding market less susceptible to panics.One of the reasons that Wells Fargo is behind some of the other banks is that it has traditionally relied on client deposits for funding, and simply did not need to borrow money from other banks or from investors.While clients can quickly withdraw deposits, they are still considered ""sticky"" – meaning banks don't anticipate that depositors will withdraw their funds all at once-- and the Fed may take that into account by granting banks such as Wells Fargo more leeway when setting its long-term debt requirement.""We would not be surprised if there are some differentiations between the banks based on their business models. But that's an assumption, that's not an information,"" De Longevialle said.Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) have far fewer deposits to fund their business, and they are also the two banks that far exceed the 25 percent thought to be the upper boundary for loss-absorbing capital level.A senior Fed staffer working on the rule said at a conference last week he would prefer consensus among the world's regulators grouped together in the G20's Financial Stability Board before the Fed put out its own rule.Banks in Europe often have a different legal structure than those in the United States, which group all their operating subsidiaries under one holding company, and this may make it hard to agree on a common approach soon.

112,"  American Brendan Steele eagled his opening hole and raised hopes of firing a magical 59 before finishing with an eight-under-par 62 in Thursday's opening round at the Travelers Championship in Cromwell, Connecticut.Steele, who moved to eight under after just 13 holes before closing with five successive pars, ended the day with a one-stroke lead over compatriots Ryan Moore and Bud Cauley at the TPC River Highlands.Americans Chad Campbell, Joe Durant, Jeff Maggert, Scott Langley and Eric Axley carded 64s while 2010 winner and reigning Masters champion Bubba Watson opened with a 67.Steele, who won his only PGA Tour title at the 2011 Texas Open, made a sizzling start as he holed out from 129 yards to eagle the par-four first.He then birdied the second, seventh and eighth, where he drained a 27-footer, to reach the turn in five-under 30 before picking up further shots at the 11th, 12th and 13th. ""The thoughts crept in,"" Steele, 31, told reporters about the opportunity to shoot a 59 with three more birdies required over his last five holes. ""If they don't creep in, do I shoot 59, do I shoot 65?""It definitely was in the back of my mind, so probably amped me up a little bit more, so made everything a little bit tougher.""Steele was delighted, though, to reap reward on Thursday after playing some good golf over the past few months without getting the scores he felt he deserved, including missed cuts in his previous two tournaments.

114,"   By Dena Aubin | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A federal judge has denied Wells Fargo's latest bid to end a lawsuit brought by the Los Angeles city government accusing the bank of discriminatory lending that led to a wave of foreclosures among minority borrowers. In a ruling made public on Monday, U.S. District Judge Otis Wright denied the San Francisco-based bank's motion to have an appeals court decide whether Los Angeles has legal standing to recover damages under the U.S. Fair Housing Act. Wells is one of four banks sued by Los Angeles for allegedly giving minorities mortgage loans they could not afford, causing defaults, lower property values and neighborhood blight.The city is seeking damages for lost tax revenue and increased city expenses in affected neighborhoods. The mortgage crisis in Los Angeles resulted in more than 200,000 foreclosures and lowered home values by an estimated $78 billion from 2008 to 2012, according to a report cited by the city in its lawsuit, filed in December. Spokesmen and lawyers for Wells and Los Angeles did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Wells has previously contested the claims, saying it is prepared to defend its record as a responsible lender.  The city has also sued Citigroup, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase to recover damages for alleged mortgage discrimination. Wright in May had turned down Wells Fargo's first motion to have the case dismissed. On Monday, he rebuffed the bank's request for an immediate appeal of that decision, saying there were no substantial grounds for a difference of opinion about the law involved in the case. Wells had argued that the city lacked standing to recover damages under the Fair Housing Act, which was passed to provide for fair housing.

120,"   By Peter Rudegeair and Tanya Agrawal  Wells Fargo & Co, the fourth-largest U.S. bank, reported a 39 percent drop in mortgage revenue for the second quarter as lending volume dropped, underscoring the urgency for the bank to find other sources of income growth.The bank managed to boost earnings and meet analyst estimates through gains from investments in stocks and bonds among other areas. But that income could be difficult to repeat in coming quarters, analysts said.Meanwhile, the pressure on Wells Fargo's mortgage business, one of its largest sources of revenue for years, is continuing and intense. The bank's shares fell 0.4 percent to $51.58.Overall U.S. mortgage lending volumes have been falling for 15 months as rates have risen, cutting into demand to refinance home loans. This spring was also a weak home buying season compared with last year's, Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry told investors on a conference call.""The purchase market is softer than we thought it would be,"" Shrewsberry said.But Wells Fargo's mortgage volume declines were greater than the overall market in percentage terms, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's estimates. That may be because last year smaller banks were selling their loans to Wells Fargo, which in turn would package them into bonds to sell to investors under government programs, which counted as Wells Fargo's volume. Many of those banks are now selling directly to investors under government programs, Chairman and Chief Executive John Stumpf said in an interview. The bank is the largest U.S. mortgage lender.This is the first quarter since 2009 that Wells Fargo did not report an increase in earnings per share from the preceding quarter, ending a 17-quarter streak.The second-quarter results reflect how hard a job Stumpf has in trying to boost revenue from other businesses. Even as unemployment falls in the United States and the economy shows signs of recovery, loan growth has been tepid: the bank's loans, excluding pre-crisis assets it is winding down, rose just 2 percent in the second quarter from the first quarter.Wells Fargo is the first of the major banks to post earnings, and rivals likely faced similar headwindsOverall, Wells Fargo earned $5.42 billion, or $1.01 per share, in line with estimates from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In the second quarter of 2013, the bank earned $5.27 billion, or 98 cents per share. The rising U.S. stock market helped Wells Fargo in several ways. Its net gains from equity investments rose 121 percent to $449 million, while earnings from its wealth, brokerage and retirement business grew 25 percent to $544 million thanks in part to fees tied to higher market valuations.Net gains from debt securities were $71 million compared with a loss of $54 million a year earlier.Revenue slipped to $21.1 billion, from $21.4 billion in the second quarter of 2013, slightly beating expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Wells Fargo made $47 billion of home loans, down from $112 billion a year earlier but up from $36 billion in the first quarter. Revenue from mortgage banking fell to $1.7 billion.

It says it now employs the largest staff of petroleum engineers of any U.S. bank. And unlike many of its other divisions, which are primarily focused on the U.S. market, Wells Fargo's energy business has expanded internationally to places such as Aberdeen in Scotland and Calgary, Canada. ""We have the biggest and most-focused business in that space,"" said Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry in an interview on Friday. He said Wells Fargo has 400 employees dedicated to serving energy companies. Shrewsberry said the bank finances companies across the energy sector. These include companies specializing in exploration and production, those that own and operate pipelines and barges, and those that refine and process oil and natural gas. Wells also says it is now the top underwriter of high-yield bonds and syndicated loans for oil and gas companies.  Additionally, it has $500 million to $600 million in direct equity stakes in energy firms through its merchant banking activities. Wells Fargo's push into the energy sector provides a window into how the San Francisco-based bank plans to make up for the decline in mortgage income, which plummeted in 2013 as a refinancing boom came to an end. The bank has said its 89 other businesses, ranging from auto loans and credit cards to wealth management and investment banking, would eventually make up for the lost revenue as the economy accelerates.  ""They're out on the sea in their boat and they've pitched their sails,"" standing ready to benefit from economic growth, said Tony Scherrer, director of research at Smead Capital Management. The Seattle-based investment firm has $966 million in assets under management and owns Wells shares. But so far growth has been tepid, with those other businesses failing to fully offset the decline in mortgages. In the second quarter, mortgage banking revenue was $1.7 billion, down 39 percent over the same period last year. Because of the diminished demand for home loans, both revenue and fee income at the bank has fallen for four consecutive quarters on a year-over-year basis. BRIGHT SPOT The energy sector has been one of the brighter spots in the U.S. economy over the last few years, thanks to the shale oil and gas discoveries and the fracking boom. It has made millions for wildcat drillers, mineral-rights holders and oil-and-gas firms and supercharged economic growth in North Dakota, Texas and other parts of the country. Wells Fargo's energy banking revenues have increased at a compound annual growth rate of 23 percent to $1.04 billion in 2013 from $690 million in 2011. Net income has grown at a similar pace, though Wells does not break out those numbers.  Wells Fargo, which has had a presence in energy banking for 40 years, touts the diversity of the business. Around 45 percent of that revenue comes from loans to energy companies, while a quarter comes from investment banking services. A part of its strategy is to bank a lot of smaller energy firms in the hope it will be able to sell them more of its products and services as they grow, said Mike Johnson, head of Wells Fargo’s corporate banking, in May. This practice of cross-selling is already paying some dividends. In 2012, Wells Fargo acquired a $3.5 billion portfolio of energy loans and a team of bankers from BNP Paribas. It has since increased the number of products that unit's clients used to 8 from 5 in 2013.

The bank has said its 89 other businesses, ranging from auto loans and credit cards to wealth management and investment banking, would eventually make up for the lost revenue as the economy accelerates.""They're out on the sea in their boat and they've pitched their sails,"" standing ready to benefit from economic growth, said Tony Scherrer, director of research at Smead Capital Management. The Seattle-based investment firm has around $865 million in assets under management and owns Wells shares. But so far growth has been tepid, with those other businesses failing to fully offset the decline in mortgages. In the second quarter, mortgage banking revenue was $1.7 billion, down 39 percent over the same period last year. Because of the diminished demand for home loans, both revenue and fee income at the bank has fallen for four consecutive quarters on a year-over-year basis.BRIGHT SPOT The energy sector has been one of the brighter spots in the U.S. economy over the past few years, thanks to the shale oil and gas discoveries and the fracking boom. It has made millions for wildcat drillers, mineral-rights holders and oil-and-gas firms and supercharged economic growth in North Dakota, Texas, and other parts of the country. Wells, which has had a presence in energy banking for 40 years, sees that as a unique opportunity for growth.""We're in the real economy, and there are certain sectors of the economy that are doing very well. We are a big energy lender,"" Wells Fargo Chairman and Chief Executive John Stumpf said on a Friday conference call with analysts. Stumpf added that domestic production of crude oil was running at the highest level in 26 years. Energy banking revenues have increased at a compound annual growth rate of 23 percent to $1.04 billion in 2013 from $690 million in 2011. Net income has grown at a similar pace, though Wells does not break out those numbers.""We are continuing to invest in the business, and as we look forward we continue to see this as a major growth opportunity still, not only for corporate banking but for Wells Fargo,"" said Mike Johnson, head of corporate banking, at the bank's investor day in May.The bank recently opened a small outpost in Aberdeen, Scotland to cater to energy businesses working in the North Sea.  It also has a growing footprint in Calgary, Canada.In 2012, Wells Fargo acquired a $3.5 billion portfolio of energy loans and a team of bankers from BNP Paribas. It has since increased the number of products that unit's clients used to 8 from 5 in 2013.Shrewsberry said many large energy clients have also recently tapped Wells to handle their wealth management needs. He declined to give the identity of the clients.

124,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 11 (Fitch) Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) has reported a decrease in  net income from the prior quarter, but the company's return on assets (ROA) of  1.47% still remains very strong, according to Fitch Ratings. Fitch views this  positively particularly in what remains to be a challenging operating  environment and believes that WFC's earnings performance helps to support the  company's high ratings.  Wells' 2Q'14 earnings, which were up nearly 4% versus the same quarter a year  ago, continue to be supported by lower credit costs and revenue growth across  its various business units. Fitch also observes that when adjusting for the  one-time discreet tax benefit in 1Q'14, earnings were actually up sequentially.  Revenue growth, which continues to be a challenge for the banking industry as a  whole, was up over 2% on a linked-quarter basis, reflecting not only one extra  day in the quarter but also organic loan growth and increases in mortgage  banking and wealth management revenue.  While net interest income expanded sequentially, WFC's net interest margin (NIM)  has continued its steady downward march, falling an additional 5bps from last  quarter. Additionally, the company's margin has fallen 32bps year-over-year, due  to a mix of higher cash and short-term investments as well as industry-wide  pressure on loan yields.  Noninterest income, up over 2.5%, once again increased on a linked-quarter  basis, driven by revenue growth across WFC's corporate banking, wealth  management and consumer banking platforms. After a strong 1Q'14, net gains from  trading activities, debt securities and equity investments were sequentially  down. However, increases in mortgage banking, and trust and investment fees  offset the decline.  After several sequential declines, WFC experienced a 30% increase in mortgage  originations compared to 1Q'14 leading to sequentially higher mortgage banking  income for the first time in over a year. Fitch notes that quarterly  applications were also up for the first time in over four quarters, increasing  20% indicating that mortgage activity, not only at WFC but industry-wide,  appears to have stabilized or is close to stabilizing. However, Fitch also notes  that gain on sale margins fell 20bps indicating the competitive nature of the  market in order to drive new business growth. Expenses rose noticeably on a sequential basis driven largely by a $205 million  linked-quarter increase in operating losses due primarily to litigation  accruals. Still, the company maintained its efficiency ratio of 57.9% during the  quarter, within its target of 55 - 59%.  WFC reported a sequentially flat reserve release of $500 million during 2Q'14,  or 5.8% of pre-tax income. Impressively, net charge-offs (NCOs) were just 35bps  during the quarter, down from 41bps in 1Q'14 and well below WFC's historical  loss history of around 100bps. WFC expects to continue reserve releases, absent  a significant deterioration in economic conditions, albeit at a lower level as  credit quality improvement slows and modest loan growth continues.  Estimated Common Equity Tier 1 under Basel III Advanced Approach was solid  10.09% at quarter-end up 2bps from the prior quarter. WFC executed on its  capital request under CCAR, increasing its dividend to $0.35 from $0.30 per  quarter and repurchasing nearly 40 million shares during 2Q'14. WFC's previously  disclosed total net payout ratio target is between 55% and 75% of earnings.

125,"  (Adds links to graphic and Reuters Insider - Breakingviews)By Peter Rudegeair and Tanya AgrawalJuly 11 Wells Fargo & Co, the fourth-largest U.S. bank, reported a 39 percent drop in mortgage revenue for the second quarter as lending volume dropped, underscoring the urgency for the bank to find other sources of income growth.The bank managed to boost earnings and meet analyst estimates through gains from investments in stocks and bonds among other areas. But that income could be difficult to repeat in coming quarters, analysts said.Meanwhile, the pressure on Wells Fargo's mortgage business, one of its largest sources of revenue for years, is continuing and intense. The bank's shares fell 0.4 percent to $51.58.Overall U.S. mortgage lending volumes have been falling for 15 months as rates have risen, cutting into demand to refinance home loans. This spring was also a weak home buying season compared with last year's, Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry told investors on a conference call.""The purchase market is softer than we thought it would be,"" Shrewsberry said. But Wells Fargo's mortgage volume declines were greater than the overall market in percentage terms, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's estimates. That may be because  last year smaller banks were selling their loans to Wells Fargo, which in turn would package them into bonds to sell to investors under government programs, which counted as Wells Fargo's volume.Many of those banks are now selling directly to investors under government programs, Chairman and Chief Executive John Stumpf said in an interview. The bank is the largest U.S. mortgage lender.This is the first quarter since 2009 that Wells Fargo did not report an increase in earnings per share from the preceding quarter, ending a 17-quarter streak. The second-quarter results reflect how hard a job Stumpf has in trying to boost revenue from other businesses.Even as unemployment falls in the United States and the economy shows signs of recovery, loan growth has been tepid: the bank's loans, excluding pre-crisis assets it is winding down, rose just 2 percent in the second quarter from the first quarter.Wells Fargo is the first of the major banks to post earnings, and rivals likely faced similar headwinds Overall, Wells Fargo earned $5.42 billion, or $1.01 per share, in line with estimates from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In the second quarter of 2013, the bank earned $5.27 billion, or 98 cents per share.The rising U.S. stock market helped Wells Fargo in several ways. Its net gains from equity investments rose 121 percent to $449 million, while earnings from its wealth, brokerage and retirement business grew 25 percent to $544 million thanks in part to fees tied to higher market valuations.Net gains from debt securities were $71 million compared with a loss of $54 million a year earlier.Revenue slipped to $21.1 billion, from $21.4 billion in the second quarter of 2013, slightly beating expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Wells Fargo made $47 billion of home loans, down from $112 billion a year earlier but up from $36 billion in the first quarter. Revenue from mortgage banking fell to $1.7 billion.(Reporting by Peter Rudegeair and Tanya Agrawal; Editing by Ted Kerr and Steve Orlofsky)",2014-07-11,WFC,"Fri Jul 11, 2014 | 1:46pm EDT","UPDATE 4-Wells Fargo mortgage revenue drops, shares fall",http://www.reuters.com//article/wellsfargo-results-idUSL4N0PM34C20140711?type=companyNews

127,"  American Brian Harman clinched a late ticket to the British Open when he won the John Deere Classic by one stroke in Silvis, Illinois, on Sunday.The diminutive left-hander handled the pressure of leading into the final round, overcoming early nerves to card a five-under-par 66 at TPC John Deere Run.He had the luxury of three-putting the final hole, tapping in from six inches to finish at 22-under 262, while compatriot Zach Johnson (64) was second at 21-under.""I bought my passport and a couple of jackets. I can't wait to get on that plane,"" Harman told CBS television.The leading finisher at the tournament who was not already exempt into the British Open qualified to play at Royal Liverpool starting on Thursday, so Harman was the last player to earn a spot on the charter flight that will arrive in Manchester on Monday morning.The 27-year-old has played in only one major, the 2012 U.S. Open, where he missed the cut.Harman collected $846,000 for his first PGA Tour victory. Among his other rewards is an invitation to next year's Masters in his home state of Georgia. He took a one-stroke lead into the final round, and a fine eagle at the par-five second, where he drilled his approach shot to four feet, was a perfect starting tonic, though it took him several more holes to calm down.""I was aware of what was going on all day but I didn't really start playing well until I put that in the back of my mind,"" Harman told reporters.He has always had a knack for the game, but it was not until earlier this year when he stopped emulating his peers that he started to fulfill his potential. ""I made the decision to try to be a better version of myself and see where that took me,"" he said.""I've always been a pretty gifted ball-striker. This was really the first week I felt complete command, working the ball both ways.""This will have a special place in my heart for the remainder of my career."" He says his height (five feet, seven inches) has long provided motivation.""I've always had a chip on my shoulder. There are times that it feels good to hit it by a guy who's bigger than me.""I just try to hit the back of the ball as hard as I can."" (Reporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina.

128,"  Brian Harman hit almost every fairway and green to shoot six-under-par 65 and lead fellow American Steve Stricker by one stroke after the third round at the John Deere Classic in Silvis, Illinois, on Saturday.Harman, unlike his nearest rival, is carrying his passport in case he earns a late ticket to the British Open next week.Seeking his first win in his 88th start on the PGA Tour, Harman took advantage of generous hole locations and preferred lies after overnight rain to compile a round that included two eagles but was capped by a disappointing bogey at the last.Harman was at 17-under, while Stricker (64), who has won three times at the TPC Deere Run, was alone in second place after sinking a long birdie at the last.Another American, Scott Brown, was two back after a 61, the best round of the day. “I'm going to try to shoot the lowest score I possibly can,” Harman told reporters. “If it's good enough, great. If not, I'll be chilling on the boat next week.“It’s a first shot golf course. You’ve got to really get in good position to attack those pins. They were decently accessible today and I made a couple of putts and shot a good score.” Stricker, meanwhile, has already pulled out of the British Open for the second straight year, notwithstanding that he has does not have a major title on an otherwise impressive resume that includes 12 PGA Tour victories.Whatever his attitude towards the Open, he has an affinity for this week's venue. “I have good feelings when I step up to the putts here,” he said. “To get back in the winner's circle would mean a lot, so there will be some pressure on me as well as everybody else, but there is a comfort factor here for me for sure.” (Reporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina, editing by Gene Cherry)",2014-07-13,WFC,"Sat Jul 12, 2014 | 10:58pm EDT",Journeyman Harman leads by one at John Deere Classic,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-golf-pga-idUSKBN0FH0Z020140713?type=companyNews

Wells Fargo, which also helped arrange the loan for OPIC, extended the remaining $80 million loan.The proceeds will be used to fund a group of Itaú Unibanco's clients, chiefly small- and mid-sized firms, located in Brazil's northern and northeastern regions, said Carolina de Arruda Camargo, the head of international financial institutions at Itaú BBA, the corporate and investment-banking arm of Itaú.

131,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK, July 25  NEW YORK, July 25 A former Bank of America Corp  derivatives trader who pleaded guilty to conspiring to falsify documents was spared prison on Friday after spending years helping the government probe bid-rigging in the $3.7 trillion municipal bond market.Brian Zwerner, a former manager of Bank of America's municipal derivatives desk, was sentenced to spend three years on probation and pay a $10,000 fine by U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero in New York.Zwerner had pleaded guilty in 2011 to conspiring to make false entries in reports and other papers sent from his desk to bank management.According to court papers he has also agreed to pay Bank of America $890,000 and settle related U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) civil charges.""I deeply regret my actions,"" the Atlanta resident told Marrero. The government's antitrust investigation has resulted in numerous convictions and $743 million in settlements with Bank of America, UBS AG, General Electric Co, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co.Zwerner's lawyer said her client's cooperation also helped the SEC understand complex mortgage products at the heart of the financial crisis.""He was their big break in the Abacus case and their case against Wachovia,"" the lawyer, Katya Jestin, said in court. Wells Fargo paid $11 million in 2011 to resolve SEC claims over collateralized debt obligations sold by Wachovia Corp, which it bought at the end of 2008. Zwerner had begun working there in 2005.Goldman Sachs Group Inc, meanwhile, agreed in 2010 to pay $550 million to settle claims it misled investors in a CDO tied to subprime mortgages called Abacus 2007-AC1.Jestin declined to comment after the hearing. SEC representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Justice Department said from 1999 to 2002, Zwerner  conspired to falsify bank records related to marketing profits, so Bank of America could pay kickbacks to brokers including Beverly Hills, California-based CDR Financial Products Inc.Prosecutors said these kickbacks enabled the bank to pay brokers to manipulate bidding for investment agreements or other municipal finance contracts, and win certain bids.Bank of America, which reported the misconduct after uncovering it, reached a $137.3 million settlement with federal and state authorities in 2010, and agreed to pay $20 million to resolve a related class action in 2013.Phillip Murphy, a former managing director of Bank of America's municipal derivatives desk, is the last defendant convicted in the municipal bond probe to still await sentencing. Zwerner had been expected to testify against him.The case is U.S. v. Zwerner, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 11-cr-00293.

135,"   By Peter Rudegeair | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) has relaxed its standards for loans for some high-priced homes as the largest U.S. mortgage lender tries to combat an industry-wide drop in mortgage volumes.The bank has eased its lending standards on mortgages it acquires from other banks, said spokesman Tom Goyda, for ""jumbo"" loans that are too large to receive a guarantee from government-backed mortgage companies. In late July, the San Francisco-based bank lowered the minimum credit score on these fixed-rate jumbo mortgages to 700 from 720, Goyda said. Credit scores range from 300 to 850, and levels below 640 are often considered subprime.The lower requirements for jumbo loans are the latest effort by Wells and other banks to loosen mortgage criteria that are still tight by historical standards. Of the large banks surveyed by the Federal Reserve in July, thirty-nine percent said they were somewhat relaxing requirements on prime residential mortgages, and all banks reported that demand for prime mortgages was at its highest level in a year.The mortgage industry is seeking to replace lost revenue after a spike in mortgage rates in the second half of 2013 made refinancing less attractive. But for many lenders the search for revenue is tempered by the fact that the housing market is still recovering from the worst crisis since the Great Depression. New rules and regulations designed to prevent the next mortgage implosion have also made some banks less willing to take risk in the market.  In June, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said, ""It is difficult for any homeowner who doesn't have pristine credit these days to get a mortgage. I think that is one of the factors that is causing the housing recovery to be slow.""     In addition to lowering minimum credit scores, Wells Fargo is now willing to buy jumbo loans from other lenders that go toward the purchase of a second home, Goyda said. For a refinancing, the bank is now willing to buy mortgages whose balance exceeds the size of the borrower's previous loan, known as ""cash-out refinancing.""     Wells Fargo's standards for mortgages it buys from other lenders remained more conservative than those it offers directly to consumers via its branches and online, Goyda said. The minimum credit score on those jumbo mortgages is 680.  The latest expansion of Wells Fargo's mortgage lending comes six months after the bank began to offer home loans directly to borrowers with credit scores as low as 600 that were eligible for insurance with the Federal Housing Administration. Its previous minimum credit score for FHA-insured loans was 640. Wells Fargo executives have said its steps to expand access to mortgage credit are low-risk, as all borrowers must demonstrate an ability to repay the loan in accordance with rules issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that came into effect in January. Most products the bank offers are 30-year, fixed-rate loans that do not allow borrowers to defer principal payments, Wells Fargo Home Mortgage President Mike Heid said at the bank's May investor day. ""This talk about returning to subprime is just nonsense,"" Heid said.  As industry-wide lending volumes have declined over the last year, Wells Fargo's drop has been even sharper. The bank said last month that it made $47 billion in home loans in the second quarter, 58 percent less than the same period of 2013, compared with a 50 percent fall in industry-wide volumes, according to estimates from the Mortgage Bankers Association. ""The purchase market is softer than we thought that it would be,"" said Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry on a July conference call with analysts. ""We're not seeing breakout returns to pre-crisis levels of the enthusiasm around homeownership.""Chief Executive John Stumpf told Reuters in a July interview that the volume of mortgages it purchased from other banks in the second quarter was lower because those lenders are now selling directly to investors under government programs.

137,"   By Luciana Lopez and Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Aug 14 Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc disclosed a new  $366 million stake in cable TV operator Charter Communications Inc and pared its holdings in two other pay-TV companies, part of a flurry of changes in its stock investments during the second quarter.Shares of Charter shares rose about 2 percent after-hours after Berkshire reported a new 2.3 million share stake, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing that detailed its domestic equity investments as of June 30.Charter is ""the play of choice on cable consolidation,"" said Wunderlich Securities analyst Matthew Harrigan.""You've got a good story on an as-is basis and if they do more deals they can do a lot more value,"" he said.DirecTV is awaiting regulatory approval to sell itself to AT&T for $48.5 billion.Charter declined to comment. A message left with DirecTV was not immediately answered. Shares of companies often rise after Berkshire reveals new  investments because some investors consider it a vote of confidence by Buffett and try to copy him.Berkshire did not disclose whether the Charter investment was made by Buffett or one of his portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler.Buffett has said he generally makes Berkshire's larger investments such as Wells Fargo & Co and Coca-Cola Co , while other investments, especially in sectors he is less familiar with, are often made by Combs or Weschler, who have smaller sums to invest. Within the pay TV sector, Berkshire said its stake in DirecTV fell by about 11 million shares since the end of March to 23.5 million. It is also no longer reporting any stake in premium TV cable network Starz.The sales of stocks contributed to a significant increase during the quarter in Berkshire's cash pile, which ended June at $55.5 billion.That gives Buffett power to make at least one big acquisition and still retain his desired $20 billion cushion. In Thursday's filing, Berkshire reported a new stake in Now Inc, an energy distribution business recently spun off from oilfield equipment provider National Oilwell Varco Inc , whose stock Berkshire also owns.Among the companies in which Berkshire reported higher share stakes were General Motors Corp, IBM Corp, Suncor Energy Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.It also reported lower holdings in many companies, including oil company ConocoPhillips, former Washington Post owner Graham Holdings Co, National Oilwell Varco, and former Starz owner Liberty Media Corp.U.S. regulators require large investors to disclose their stock holdings every quarter, and the disclosures can offer a window to their strategies for buying and selling stocks.Berkshire ended June with more than $119 billion of equities, about 90 percent of which are on U.S. exchanges. It also owns more than 80 businesses ranging from ice cream to insurance to railroads.

147,"   By Peter Rudegeair | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Getting a mortgage in the United States may be easier than many borrowers think, according to a survey released Monday by Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), the largest U.S. mortgage lender.Nearly two-thirds of respondents thought that a very good credit score was necessary to buy a home, and more than 40 percent thought they needed a down payment equal to at least 20 percent of the purchase price to buy a home.Under government-backed programs, first-time home buyers with subprime credit scores can get a mortgage insured by the Federal Housing Administration, and they can put down as little as 3.5 percent of the purchase price.Since the financial crisis, lenders have clamped down on mortgage credit. The Mortgage Bankers Association’s Mortgage Credit Availability Index, which measures the ease with which borrowers can take out a home loan based on credit scores, loan-to-value ratios and other factors, fell by more than 80 percent from early 2007 through August 2014. But there are other reasons why consumers are not taking out loans like they once did, including the fear of being turned down. In 2013, those fears kept 19 percent of families from taking steps to get a consumer loan, up from 18.5 percent in 2010 and above the 16.4 percent rate of families who were actually turned down for credit, according to the Federal Reserve’s most recent survey of consumer finances.Even if mortgage credit is hard to come by, there is demand for homes: more than two out of three respondents in Wells Fargo's survey said it was a good time to buy. Franklin Codel, Wells Fargo’s head of mortgage production, said his bank has taken steps to expand the pool of eligible home buyers. Earlier this year it lowered the minimum credit scores, or FICO scores, for loans that are backed by the government the Federal Housing Administration, Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac.“When we expanded FICO ranges, we saw not only an increase in applications but we also saw an increase in approval rates,” Codel said, without providing specifics on application volume or approval rates. Codel also said that the federal government, along with Wells Fargo and the realtors and consumer groups with whom it works, can play a role in dispelling these myths through some kind of outreach program along the lines of what they did with the government-subsidized Home Affordable Refinance Program and the Home Affordable Modification Program.Because Wells Fargo’s survey is the first of its kind, it is difficult to say how attitudes toward home ownership have changed over time. Fannie Mae’s August national housing survey found a similar number of borrowers – 64 percent – thought it was a good time to buy a home, though tied an all-time low and was down from the 71 percent response rate in the August 2013 survey.

Ruggieri made more than $117,000 in profits, the agency said.The SEC said Bolan also tipped another close friend about the ratings changes, letting the friend reap $10,000. The friend has since died.The two ex-employees plan to contest the charges in the SEC's administrative court. Sam Lieberman, an attorney with Sadis & Goldberg LLP, said Bolan and Ruggieri ""vehemently deny"" the charges and that the SEC's decision to bring the case in its in-house court instead of a federal court raises questions about its case.""The SEC knows that it has serious weaknesses in its case, and that is why it is choosing to bring this as an administrative proceeding instead of trying this case in a federal court,"" he said.  He also contested some facts in the SEC complaint, saying Ruggieri did not reap $117,000. It was a proprietary account for the bank and not his client's personal account, he said. Monday's case marks at least the third time the SEC has charged former Wells Fargo employees with insider trading in recent years. Last week, Wells Fargo was fined by the SEC and admitted it had faulty control procedures in connection with a  different employee in the Wells Fargo Advisors LLC unit who has been charged in criminal and civil proceedings with insider trading in Burger King securities before a 2010 buyout.  A Wells Fargo spokeswoman said Wells Fargo Securities immediately reported the concerns in this case to the SEC in 2011, is ""not a party to the matter"" and cooperated during the probe.According to the SEC complaint, Ruggieri was fired from Wells Fargo in 2011, and Bolan resigned after both were questioned by compliance personnel about communications involving non-public information.The SEC said that between April 2010 and March 2011, Bolan published eight ratings changes, and Ruggieri traded ahead for six, either by selling stock short or purchasing stock depending on whether an upgrade or downgrade was coming. The stocks he allegedly traded were Parexel International Corp, Covance Inc, Albany Molecular Research Inc, AthenaHealth Inc, Emdeon Inc, which is now part of Blackstone, and Bruker Corp.The SEC said Bolan is now working for Sterne Agee Group in Nashville, Tennessee, and Ruggieri is employed by International Strategy & Investment Group PLC out of Raleigh, North Carolina.The compliance officer at ISI declined to comment.

157,"  NEW YORK Oct 6 Two financial advisers who left Wells Fargo Advisors in late summer to launch their own independent advisory firm outside Kansas City, Kansas, joined Dynasty Financial Partners' network, Dynasty said on Monday.Timothy Rodgers and Keith Osborne, who managed $400 million in combined client assets at Wells Fargo, resigned in mid-July and early August respectively to open NovaR Wealth Advisors along with client services associate Brian Fry. Rodgers, who spent two-thirds of his 30-year career at AG Edwards, said running his own business allows him to present more options and investment opportunities to his clients, many of whom are high net worth individuals. Dynasty is a New York firm founded in 2010 by former Smith Barney and Citigroup executives that designs technology and investment products for independent advisers.

158,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 07 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Wells Fargo & Company's  (WFC) ratings at 'AA-/F1+'. The Rating Outlook remains Stable. The affirmation  reflects its superior earnings profile, diversified business model, and strong  management team.  The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One Financial Corporation (COF),  Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares  Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holdings  Corporation (MUFG), PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC), Regions Financial  Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI), US Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo &  Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - VRs, IDRs, and Senior Debt: Wells Fargo & Company's (WFC) ratings were affirmed primarily reflecting the  company's superior earning profile, strong franchise and business model, and  experienced management team. The company's capital and liquidity profiles remain  solid, and asset quality continues to improve.  WFC's financial performance over the past several years has been very solid  despite a challenging economic and interest rate environment. WFC continues to  post very strong net income each quarter, with return on assets (ROAs) well in  excess of the large regional average. This is particularly noteworthy given the  dramatic slowdown in refinancings beginning in the second half of last year, and  WFC's prominent role in mortgage.  Fitch considers WFC's franchise and business model as a key rating strength. WFC  boasts leading market shares in many areas, including mortgage originations,  servicing, commercial real estate, small business lending, automobile lending,  and private student lending. WFC's retail branch network had either the leading  or second largest market share in 25 of the 39 states in which it operates.  Furthermore, WFC is either first, second or third in markets that comprise over  90% of total consolidated deposits. WFC offers a wide range of financial  services through more than 80 different business lines. This diversity helps  insulate the company from downturns in various product lines, as evidenced by  the recent mortgage refinancing slowdown. WFC's management team is viewed very favorably by Fitch. There has been a great  deal of stability in the executive management ranks, with little turnover. What  also sets WFC apart from its peers is the bench strength and tenure with WFC of  the executive management team. The average tenure with WFC of the operating  committee, which comprises the business lines heads, as well as the company's  CEO, CRO, CFO and general counsel, is approximately 27 years. Fitch views this  as a competitive strength as the company's strategic direction and corporate  culture remains consistent, and less vulnerable to swings in strategy. WFC's  stated strategic objectives are clearly articulated, and achievable. Even during  a challenging interest rate environment, the company is able to easily meet its  four publicly stated financial targets. Fitch believes that WFC is appropriately capitalized, particularly given its  solid funding and earnings profiles, to manage through continued economic  challenges ahead.  WFC's estimated common equity Tier I (CETI) under Basel III  (Advanced Approach, fully phased-in) was 10.14% at June 30, 2014, slightly above  the company's internal target of 10%. WFC indicated that CCAR is the primary  driver influencing targeted capital ratios. WFC, like the industry, is vulnerable to a rapid unexpected increase in interest  rates, particularly in its securities portfolio. Approximately 60% of the AFS  portfolio is made up mortgage-backed securities, which are exposed to a rising  rate environment given possible extension risk. At June 30, 2014, net unrealized  gains in the mortgage-backed securities portfolio totaled $3.7 billion. If rates  were to rise 200 basis points (bps), the unrealized position would fall to a  loss of $10.3 billion in the mortgage-backed securities portfolio. Fitch  estimates that this would lead to an approximate 70 bps decline in the company's  estimated CETI under Basel III. As such, and given the treatment of MSRs under  Basel III and the finalization of any systemically important capital buffer for  WFC, Fitch expects WFC to maintain an appropriate capital buffer to withstand  the related volatility in capital ratios. WFC is primarily deposit funded, with core deposits representing 75% of total  funding sources as of June 30, 2014. Fitch views WFC's deposit franchise as  currently undervalued in this low-rate environment. As deposit rates have fallen  from pre-crisis levels, the benefit to WFC from its low cost of funding has  compressed. When interest rates rise, WFC will likely be able to maintain lower  funding costs relative to peers, helping to maintain superior profitability  metrics in a higher interest rate environment.  WFC's high credit ratings have helped it gain universal acceptance in virtually  all global capital markets on favorable terms, and Fitch anticipates that WFC  will continue to be able to easily issue debt to meet upcoming debt maturities  and other requirements. The parent's liquidity profile is considered solid, and  may be impacted given the outcome of Orderly Liquidity Authority (OLA)-related  proposed long-term debt requirements.  WFC will likely be one of the banking institutions that is assigned a long-term  debt requirement to facilitate resolution under OLA. Fitch notes that if the  regulators do not pursue a risk-based approach and rather apply a one-size fits  all approach, WFC will likely be the most disadvantaged of the U.S.-based G-SIBs  given its greater reliance on deposit funding and, hence, lower levels of  outstanding long-term debt. Fitch expects that WFC should be able to meet a debt  requirement, assuming there is a sufficient phase-in period. WFC still needs to  issue preferred stock and subordinated debt to meet Basel III capital  requirements and expects that to count toward the long-term debt requirement.  WFC's credit risk metrics have improved alongside the industry, but  non-performing asset (NPA) ratios remain very elevated and are the highest  amongst the large regional bank peer group. Much of the weak relative  performance is due to a large balance of mortgage-related accruing TDRs. WFC  entered the crisis with a larger relative exposure to home mortgages and home  equity products than its peers. Despite higher NPA levels, net charge-offs  (NCOs) are roughly in line with peer averages. Troubled debt restructurings  (TDRs) are high and are expected to remain elevated; however, Fitch views WFC's  strong earnings capacity as an adequate risk mitigant. RATING SENSITIVITIES - VRs, IDRs, and Senior Debt: Given that WFC's ratings are already at the top of the global rated bank  universe, Fitch views limited potential for a ratings upgrade over the near  term. Conversely, failure to maintain earnings at current levels will pressure  WFC's ratings. The strength of the earnings stream provides for solid capital  generation capabilities, which will help absorb unexpected losses.  Fitch notes some expansion recently of the wholesale banking business segment,  as WFC builds out its international presence and capital markets offerings.  Fitch expects any expansion by WFC internationally or in investment banking to  remain a primarily customer-focused strategy, and outside of that, both are  expected to remain relatively small in terms of total business mix. If WFC were  to increase its investment banking business to a size in line with other large  trading banks, there would likely be negative rating implications, although  Fitch views this as unlikely over the near term.   Fitch is aware that WFC has the ability to compete for loan growth by offering  competitive pricing given its low-cost funding base and its ability to ensure  adequate total relationship profitability with other cross-sold services and  products. However, despite the company's historical track record of being sound  risk managers, this bears close monitoring as it may point to an incremental  shifting in the company's risk appetite. Fitch remains concerned regarding the  entire industry's search for yield and stretching for risk as a result of the  continued low-yield environment. Given WFC's strong profitability metrics, Fitch  expects this possible impulse would be less urgent then at other banking  institutions. Nonetheless, if a significant shift in the risk appetite became  apparent, this would likely pressure ratings.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  WFC's Support Rating (SR) and Support Rating Floor (SRF) reflect Fitch's  expectation that there remains an extremely high probability of support from the  U.S. government if required. This expectation reflects the U.S.'s extremely high  ability to support its banks especially given its strong financial flexibility,  though propensity is becoming less certain. Specific to WFC, Fitch's view of  support likelihood is based mostly on their systemic importance in the U.S.,  significant deposit market share, and its position as a key provider of  financial services to the U.S. economy. WFC's IDRs and senior debt ratings do  not benefit from support because its VR is above the SRF. However, in Fitch's view, there is a clear intention to reduce support for  G-SIFIs in the U.S., as demonstrated by the Dodd Frank Act (DFA) and progress  regulators have made on implementing the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA).  The FDIC has proposed its single point of entry (SPOE) strategy and further  initiatives are demonstrating the U.S. government's progress to eliminate state  support for U.S. banks going forward, which increases the likelihood of senior  debt losses if its banks run afoul of solvability assessments. RATING SENSITVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  The SR and SRF are sensitive to progress made in finalizing the SPOE strategy  and any additional regulatory initiatives that may be imposed on the G-SIFIs,  including debt thresholds at the holding company. Fitch's assessment of  continuing support for U.S. G-SIFIs has to some extent relied upon the  feasibility of OLA implementation rather than its enactment into law (when DFA  passed). Hurdles that remain include the resolution of how cross-border  derivative acceleration/termination provisions are handled and that there is  sufficient contingent capital at the holding company to recapitalize without  requiring government assistance.  Fitch expects that the SPOE strategy and regulatory action to ensure sufficient  contingent capital will be finalized in the near term, but regardless of its  finalization Fitch believes that sufficient regulatory progress continues to be  made over the rating in the ratings time horizon. Therefore, Fitch expects to  revise WFC's Support Rating to '5' and SRF to 'No Floor' in the next 12-18  months. A revision of the SRF to 'No Floor' would mean no change to WFC's  long-term IDR and debt ratings because their viability ratings are all above the  SRF. KEY RATING DRIVERS - HOLDING COMPANY   WFC's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and banks,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also  equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and  subsidiary default probabilities.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - HOLDING COMPANY Should WFC's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies. This is  viewed as unlikely though for WFC given the strength of the holding company  liquidity profile.  Fitch is now considering introducing a rating differential between the holding  company and bank in the U.S. due to structural changes in the sector and the  evolving regulatory landscape, as described in the special report 'U.S. Bank  HoldCos & OpCos: Evolving Risk Profiles', dated March 27, 2014. This may result  in a possible downgrade of WFC's holding company rating, an upgrade of operating  company ratings, or no changes to ratings if Fitch's views the long-term debt  requirement assigned to WFC as providing an insufficient amount of bail-in  capital at the operating company level.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY The IDRs and VRs of WFC's bank subsidiaries benefit from the cross-guarantee  mechanism in the U.S. under FIRREA, and therefore the IDRs and VRs of Wells  Fargo Bank N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank Northwest N.A. are equalized across the  group.  The IDRs and VRs of WFC's other major rated operating subsidiaries are equalized  with WFC's IDR reflecting Fitch's view that these entities are core to WFC's  business strategy and financial profile. These entities include: Wells Fargo  Canada Corp, Wachovia Capital Finance Corporation (Canada), and Wells Fargo  Securities International Limited, whose IDRs would be sensitive to the same  factors that might drive a change in WFC's IDR. RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY  As the IDRs and VRs of the subsidiaries are equalized with those of WFC to  reflect support from their ultimate parent, they are sensitive to changes in the  parent's propensity to provide support, which Fitch currently does not expect,  or from changes in WFC's IDRs.  To the extent that one of WFC's subsidiary or affiliated companies is not  considered to be a core business, Fitch could also notch the subsidiary's rating  from WFC's IDR. KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by WFC and by various issuing  vehicles are all notched down from WFC or its bank subsidiaries' VRs in  accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective  non-performance and relative loss severity risk profiles.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings of subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by WFC and its  subsidiaries are primarily sensitive to any change in WFC's VR. KEY RATING DRIVERS - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS WFC's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one notch higher than the company's  IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from  depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default. However, WFC's uninsured  deposits outside of the U.S. do not benefit from rating uplift because they do  not typically benefit from the U.S. depositor preference unless the deposit is  expressly payable at an office of the bank in the United States. Since Fitch  cannot determine which foreign branch deposits may be dually payable, they do  not get the rating uplift. KEY RATING SENSITIVITIES - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The ratings of long- and short-term deposits issued by WFC and its subsidiaries  are primarily sensitive to any change in WFC's long- and short-term IDRs.   Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Wells Fargo & Co. --Long-term IDR at 'AA-'; Outlook Stable; --Senior debt at 'AA-'; --Subordinated debt at 'A+'; --Preferred stock at 'BBB'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1+'; --Commercial paper at 'F1+'; --Short-term debt at 'F1+';  --Market-linked securities at 'AA- EMR'; --Viability at 'aa-'; --Support at '1'; --Support floor at 'A'.

161,"   By Peter Rudegeair  Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) said third-quarter profit rose 1.7 percent, after the biggest U.S. mortgage lender's home loan business eked out its first income increase since the end of 2012. The bank made more money from selling home loans to investors during the quarter, allowing it to post a 2 percent increase in mortgage banking income even as it made 40 percent fewer home loans compared to the same period last year.The U.S. mortgage market is showing some signs of stabilizing, after plunging for about a year. Higher home loan rates in the middle of last year cut into consumer demand to refinance mortgages, hurting results at most major U.S. banks, but rates are now in more of a holding pattern. The results underscore how critical mortgage income still is to Wells Fargo. Although the bank often talks about its 89 other businesses, its fortunes in any quarter often depend largely on the home loan market. Fourth-quarter mortgage volumes are set to be lower than the $48 billion Wells Fargo made in the third quarter of 2014, Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said on a conference call with analysts. That means they will also be lower than the $50 billion it made in the fourth quarter of 2013.  ""I believe there are several factors holding the housing market back from a complete recovery,"" Chief Executive John Stumpf said on a conference call with analysts. He cited high levels of student debt, the lack of housing inventory in populous coastal markets and the legal difficulties in lending to higher-risk borrowers.Beyond mortgage, the bank did get some help in the quarter from other businesses, including private equity and venture capital investments, where the bank recorded $712 million of income before taxes, up from $502 million in the same quarter last year. The San Francisco bank's venture capital investments in technology performed well in the quarter, Shrewsberry said in an interview.  The bank reported mixed progress on three major growth initiatives: credit cards, wealth management and investment banking. Credit card balances rose 11 percent to $28.3 billion from the third quarter of 2013, but the pace of new account growth slowed.

A year ago, it posted profit of $5.32 billion, or 99 cents per share. Wells Fargo's loan portfolio grew by 3.7 percent to $838.9 billion in the quarter from the same period a year earlier, led by a 13 percent increase in commercial and industrial loans.

162,"  (Adds Breakingviews link)By Peter RudegeairOct 14 Wells Fargo & Co said third-quarter profit rose 1.7 percent, after the biggest U.S. mortgage lender's home loan business eked out its first income increase since the end of 2012.The bank made more money from selling home loans to investors during the quarter, allowing it to post a 2 percent increase in mortgage banking income even as it made 40 percent fewer home loans compared to the same period last year.The U.S. mortgage market is showing some signs of stabilizing, after plunging for about a year. Higher home loan rates in the middle of last year cut into consumer demand to refinance mortgages, hurting results at most major U.S. banks, but rates are now in more of a holding pattern. The results underscore how critical mortgage income still is to Wells Fargo. Although the bank often talks about its 89 other businesses, its fortunes in any quarter often depend largely on the home loan market.Fourth-quarter mortgage volumes are set to be lower than the $48 billion Wells Fargo made in the third quarter of 2014, Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said on a conference call with analysts. That means they will also be lower than the $50 billion it made in the fourth quarter of 2013.""I believe there are several factors holding the housing market back from a complete recovery,"" Chief Executive John Stumpf said on a conference call with analysts. He cited high levels of student debt, the lack of housing inventory in populous coastal markets and the legal difficulties in lending to higher-risk borrowers. Beyond mortgage, the bank did get some help in the quarter from other businesses, including private equity and venture capital investments, where the bank recorded $712 million of income before taxes, up from $502 million in the same quarter last year. The San Francisco bank's venture capital investments in technology performed well in the quarter, Shrewsberry said in an interview.The bank reported mixed progress on three major growth initiatives: credit cards, wealth management and investment banking.

Profit at the wealth unit, the smallest of the U.S. bank's three businesses, jumped to $550 million from $450 million a year earlier, Wells said on Tuesday. Wells' wealth, brokerage and retirement sector includes financial planning advice for wealthy investors as well as brokerage services and retirement and trust services for individuals and companies.Like many brokerage firms, Wells has been steering financial advisers to sell investment packages managed by outside advisers rather than touting individual stocks and bonds.  Managed products offer diversification for investors as well as marketing and service fees from the outside funds and advisers for banks. They also allow brokers to spend more time on client service and prospecting and less on investments, according to brokerage executives.Managed accounts also help insulate brokers and their firms from client complaints when individual investment recommendations go awry. Assets in managed accounts of brokerage clients climbed 17 percent in the third quarter to $409 billion even as Wells' brokerage force dipped 1 percent to 15,163 advisers. Wells remains the second-largest U.S. brokerage by number of brokers behind Morgan Stanley (MS.N), which has not yet reported third-quarter results. Total client brokerage assets were up 8 percent from a year earlier to $1.4 trillion as of Sept. 30.Fee revenue based largely on assets held in client accounts were a major contributor to the wealth unit's 7 percent rise in quarterly revenue to $3.6 billion, Wells said. Fees were spurred by stock market gains as well as new sales. Wells prices managed account fees at the start of each quarter, meaning third-quarter fees reflected account values as of June 30.  Expenses in the wealth businesses rose 3 percent to $71 million due in large part to increased broker commissions even though transaction revenue fell.Like Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), UBS AG UBSN.VX and other banks with big wealth networks, Wells encourages its advisers to sell mortgages, portfolio-secured loans and other banking and insurance products. Average net loans in the third quarter increased 13 percent from a year earlier and 3 percent from the second quarter to $52.6 billion. Money set aside for possible loan losses in the wealth unit grew $13 million from a year earlier, but, in a sign of improving credit, were well above the amount of loans that Wells charged off during the quarter.

166,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A former compliance officer at a unit of Wells Fargo & Co was charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday for allegedly altering a document before it was given to the agency during an insider trading investigation.The SEC said Judy Wolf, then at Wells Fargo Advisors LLC, in 2010 closed an internal review of a Brazil-based broker's trading with no findings.The broker, Waldyr Da Silva Prado Neto, was subsequently charged in criminal and civil proceedings with trading illegally in Burger King securities before a 2010 buyout of the fast food company.After the SEC charged Prado in 2012, Wolf changed the document to make it appear as if she had performed a more thorough review, the agency said as it announced an order instituting an administrative proceeding against Wolf.The SEC said its staff spotted the alteration after Wells Fargo provided the document as part of the commission's investigation. Wolf initially denied changing it, but later testified she had done so, the agency said. ""Regardless of her motivation, her conduct was inconsistent with what the SEC expects of compliance professionals and what the law requires,"" Daniel Hawke, chief of the SEC enforcement division's market abuse unit, said in a statement.Steven Salky, a lawyer for Wolf, said she ""did nothing wrong, and we look forward to clearing her of these baseless charges.""A Wells Fargo representative declined comment.

The roughly $3.26 billion buyout was announced two weeks later and valued Burger King at $24 per share, 46 percent above its price before buyout rumors surfaced.Prosecutors said Cornelsen and Prado both traded illegally in Burger King, making respective profits of $1.68 million and $175,000.Neither Prado nor Cornelsen have appeared in U.S. court to face the criminal charges. Cornelson agreed in 2012 to pay $5.1 million to settle earlier SEC charges. The agency obtained a $5.63 million default judgment against Prado in January.

169,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 15 (Fitch) Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) reported $5.7 billion in  net income for a return on assets (ROA) of 1.4%, essentially unchanged from the  prior quarter, according to Fitch Ratings. Earnings were supported by higher  spread income and lower taxes, partially offset by increased loan loss  provisioning. Fitch views these results as consistent with WFC's credit profile,  with ratings that remain among the highest in the world.  Higher spread income was supported by earning asset growth, purchase accounting  accretion and one more day in the quarter. The net interest margin (NIM)  continued to contract a further 9 basis points (bps) in the third quarter of  2014 (3Q'14), reflecting deposit inflows and liquidity-related funding actions.  WFC issued $16.3 billion in liquidity-related long-term debt issuances in 3Q'14,  as well as some additional liquidity-related short-term funding. With regard to  LCR compliance, the company disclosed that it is now solidly over 100%.  Overall noninterest income was flat on a linked-quarter basis. Lower mortgage  banking revenues were offset by increases in net gains on debt securities and  over $700 million in net gains from equity investments, primarily from Norwest  Venture Partners. These revenues combined with investment banking and trading  revenues comprised a relatively manageable 7% of total revenues in 3Q'14. The  contribution from these businesses is well below some of WFC's larger bank  peers, but these items can still be a volatile line item for WFC. The  contribution has ranged from 3.5% of total revenues in 2Q'12, to over 8% in  1Q'14. Expenses were up slightly on a sequential basis reflecting higher operating  losses related to litigation accruals and an increase in outside professional  services, partially offset by lower personnel expenses. WFC's lower tax expense  was attributed to charitable donations of appreciated securities.  WFC reported a smaller reserve release on a sequential basis of $300 million as  compared to $500 million last quarter. Net charge-offs (NCOs) reflected  continuing asset quality improvement and declined 7% to just 32bps, while  provision expenses increased 70%. WFC expects future reserve releases, absent a  significant deterioration in economic conditions.  Estimated Common Equity Tier 1 under Basel III Advanced Approach increased 32bps  to a solid 10.46% at quarter-end.

170,"   By John McCrank | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Wells Fargo (WFC.N) is closing down its alternative trading system, or ""dark pool,"" due to decreased customer demand, the company said on Thursday. The San Francisco-based bank will still offer its clients a full suite of electronic trading tools to help them execute orders, but will stop offering access to the company's dark pool on Friday, a spokeswoman from the bank told Reuters.    ""Our products are customized to fit client trading objectives and the products we offer are aligned with client demand. Effective October 17, our product suite no longer includes the Wells Fargo Liquidity Crosser,"" the bank said in a statement. Dark pools are electronic broker-run electronic trading venues, and every big bank has one. They allow investors to trade shares anonymously and only make trading data available after a trade happens, reducing the chance that others in the market will catch wind of the buyer's or seller's intentions and move the price against them. The move by Wells Fargo comes as regulatory scrutiny over dark pools has intensified over concerns about the lack of transparency in the trading venues. Several regulators have ongoing probes into dark pool operators and New York's attorney general has launched a lawsuit accusing Barclays PLC of securities fraud for activities related to its dark pool. Wells Fargo said the closure of its dark pool was not due to increased regulatory scrutiny, but rather a lack of demand. Wells Fargo's dark pool ranks 32nd out of 41 alternative trading systems tracked by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in terms of volume. For the week of Sept. 22, the Wells pool traded just under 7 million shares. By comparison, Credit Suisse's dark pool, at the top of the list, traded just under 350 million shares. With over 40 dark pools competing for much of the same order flow along with 11 U.S. stock exchanges, critics say the venues add to the fragmentation of the market, which increases complexity and costs for market participants. Wells Fargo said it would still be routing orders to other dark pools for any customer that wishes it to do so.

Benson, a registered broker with Ameriprise since 1987, moved to Wells Fargo on Oct. 16.

172,"  * Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo target supply-starved investors* Non-eurozone banks dominate as cheap ECB loans keep domestics sidelinedBy Aimee DonnellanLONDON, Oct 22 (IFR) - Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo filled the void in the euro senior unsecured bond market on Wednesday, coming with new deals in a space abandoned by eurozone banks that have opted for covered bonds and cheaper central bank funding instead.Senior unsecured supply from eurozone's banks has plummeted since the summer, with the region's lenders having sold only a paltry 3bn from September till now. This compares to UK, US, Swiss and Nordic issuers that have sold over 15bn in the same period.""The TLTRO is offering such cheap funding that there is no compulsion from the region's banks to fund or pre-fund this year,"" said a syndicate banker.""We're seeing a total reversal in the eurozone/non-eurozone issuance volumes in the past few months. Although overall the volumes are the same this year as last, that total used to be made up 80%/20% in favour of eurozone banks which is no longer the case."" From September, eurozone banks have been able to borrow up to 400bn through the European Central Bank's TLTRO, paying just 0.25% a year for the privilege - well below what they would pay to borrow in the senior unsecured market.But this bargain basement funding has not kept banks completely sidelined from the market. In the past two months, eurozone covered bond issuance has ramped up, with banks selling some 8.7bn, often at levels below the mid-swaps money market benchmark.However, the secured funding volumes are still significantly below the figures from last year, when the region's banks issued over 13.5bn in the same period. ""We have definitely seen some activity in the covered bond market, which is providing extremely cheap funding to a wide range of eurozone banks,"" said Alexandra MacMahon, head of EMEA financial institutions debt capital markets at Citigroup.""However, the market has gone a bit quiet because of the AQR,"" added MacMahon, who is expecting issuers to spend time updating their programmes before accessing the market again.This quiet period has meant that demand is even greater than usual for US banks like Citigroup, which sold a 1.5bn seven-year bond at mid-swaps plus 75bp on Monday. That deal, thanks to a favourable move in the basis swap, meant it priced inside of where Citigroup would have priced a similar bond in its home market.On Wednesday, the lack of euro area supply is also helping Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo, which have already unearthed a combined 5bn for their deals.Goldman Sachs is poised to price a five-year senior floating rate note at the same level it would price a dollar bond.The US investment bank began testing investor interest at three-month Euribor plus 80bp area, which was revised down to plus 75bp area as demand topped 1.5bn.Meanwhile, Wells Fargo is to print its seven-year euro senior benchmark at mid-swaps plus 55bp area, having first tested interest in the 60s.

The short five-minute commute from his home to the golf course was another huge bonus for Harman.""It's great,"" he smiled. ""It's the only tournament of the year I get to sleep in my own bed. I'm fortunate to be lucky enough to live down here and even more fortunate to have a tournament in my back yard."" Thompson, like Harman, flourished on the ultra-smooth greens at Sea Island.""My putter was hot today,"" said the 29-year-old from Arizona whose only PGA Tour victory came at the 2013 Honda Classic.

Wells said Burdale's client base has doubled and lending has more than doubled since the acquisition, though it does not break out revenue for the unit.The business provides loans of 10 million pounds ($16 million) or more that are backed by assets such as land, buildings, machinery or inventory. Companies that take asset-backed loans include manufacturers, retailers and technology firms, often to fund growth or refinance, or to turnaround businesses or make acquisitions. Most of Wells Fargo's revenue comes from the United States. Its number of staff in Europe, Middle East and Africa - mostly based in Britain - had increased to 930 in May from about 600 at the start of 2012 after targeting wholesale services for large and medium-sized U.S. companies and European businesses active in the United States.

176,"   By Elizabeth Dilts | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Nov 3 Bank of America Corp's  Merrill Lynch unit lost two teams of veteran advisers in late September and October, even as the firm announced it was hiring.Bank of America said it hired 155 financial advisers in the third quarter, ended Sept. 30, bringing its ""Thundering Herd,"" as the firm's adviser force is called, to 14,000.Miami-based brokers Eugene Montoya, Francisco de la Camara, Mario Baro and Kevin Montoya, nearly all of whom had spent several decades at Merrill, left for Wells Fargo Advisors  on Sept. 30, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman confirmed. Also, broker Raymond L. George left Merrill Lynch for Morgan Stanley, a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman said. His departure came shortly after the Miami group left. George, who had been with Merrill for about 23 years, joined Morgan Stanley's office in Garden City, New York, according to records with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. A Merrill spokeswoman confirmed that both the Miami group and George left the firm. However, neither she nor the Morgan Stanley spokeswoman commented on George's production at Merrill.Eugene Montoya, de la Camara and Baro collectively managed at least $390 million in assets at Merrill, the Wells Fargo spokeswoman confirmed. She could not provide information on Kevin Montoya's assets under management. The Miami group, which serves international high net worth clients primarily from Latin America, joined Wells Fargo as the St. Louis-based firm works to expand its relationships with international clients, a source at the Miami Wells Fargo office said.Bank of America has been de-emphasizing global wealth management in recent years, selling its International Wealth Management business outside the United States to Julius Baer Group in 2013.

177,"   By Peter Rudegeair and Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Wells Fargo & Co said on Wednesday it is in discussions with the U.S. government to resolve a lawsuit accusing the nation's largest mortgage lender of cheating taxpayers by submitting ineligible home loans to a federal insurance program.Wells Fargo, the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets, disclosed the talks in a quarterly filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In October 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice sued the San Francisco-based bank, saying it failed to report more than 6,000 loans that did not meet requirements for insurance under the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), and failed to properly review early payment defaults.The government said this caused the FHA to pay out hundreds of millions of dollars in claims on loans that did not qualify for insurance. Wells Fargo asked a federal judge in Washington, D.C. shortly after the complaint was filed to excuse it from the Justice Department's claims, but was rebuffed in 2013. The bank's appeal also failed. At a June hearing in New York, a Justice Department lawyer said the bank and the government had tried several times to resolve their differences but were unsuccessful. Jennifer Queliz, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan, declined comment. Wells Fargo is not the only big bank to face such allegations.

182,"  * Wealth minimum for client referrals halved to $2.5 mln* Wells wealth division to spend heavily on products and training in 2015* Division head aims to average mid-20 pct profit marginsBy Jed HorowitzNov 6 Battles between brokers and private bankers for very wealthy clients have always been fierce, but Wells Fargo & Co is changing its rules to encourage partnerships of the two rivals that it says will open a $300 billion opportunity.Wells Fargo, the fourth-biggest U.S. bank company, has told brokers who sell investment plans and bankers who sell loans and mortgages to refer clients with household assets of $2.5 million to each other, down from $5 million when the partnership plan began two years ago. The change was rolled out nationally in the past few weeks because of the program's success at the higher threshold,  David Carroll, head of Wells's Wealth, Brokerage & Retirement division said at a bank analyst conference in Boston on Thursday. Wells has booked $1.7 billion of loans, $2.2 billion of new brokerage assets and $1.4 billion of trust assets since the partnership plan began.""It is not an industry norm for traditional private bankers to play nice with brokers, but we are making it work very well,"" Carroll said. By halving the wealth threshold, Wells nearly quadruples  client households eligible for referrals to 50,000 from 13,000 and doubles to $300 billion potential brokerage assets now kept outside the bank.The number of brokers with upscale clients eligible for referrals will jump to 8,200 from 5,800, and the number of advisers in the program will likely rise to 900 from 500, according to slides accompanying Carroll's presentation.  On the flip side, only 11 percent of wealthy clients with Wells mortgages use the bank's brokers and retirement advisers.Brokers' resistance to selling jumbo mortgages and other bank products has been narrowing. Many initially resisted handing clients to bankers whose services might be less than premier, but interest income and fees from selling bank products are so high that Wells, Bank of America Corp, Morgan Stanley and UBS AG have rolled out lucrative bonus plans to encourage sales and referrals at brokerage units. More than 60 percent of Wells brokers have made loans to clients. Private bankers do not qualify for referral bonuses until they reach monthly sales quotas, but Carroll said his bankers and brokers are driven by ""internal recognition for playing team ball"" rather than by financial incentives.Wells's private bank targets clients with $1 million to $50 million of household assets compared with brokers, who aim for households with $250,000 to $5 million.Carroll's wealth sector is Well's smallest unit but generated 23 percent of the bank's $10.3 billion of fees and 52 percent of its net interest income last quarter.In 2015, the wealth businesses will spend about $250 million on product upgrades and training, areas that Carroll said have been neglected.

190,"   By Luciana Lopez and Jonathan Stempel  Nov 14 Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc  disclosed a new stake in healthcare management company Express Scripts Holding Co and shed its stake in agricultural equipment maker Deere & Co, among several changes in its stock investments during the third quarter.In a regulatory filing, Berkshire also revealed it has disclosed confidential information about its investments to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.The SEC often allows Buffett to do this to let him amass a large investment without worrying about copycat investors.  Berkshire disclosed last week that it had bought more than $2.3 billion of equity securities in the third quarter.Berkshire bought 449,489 shares of Express Scripts in the quarter, making it among the smallest holdings in its portfolio.Shares of Express Scripts rose 0.4 percent in after-hours trading to $78.20. Companies' shares often rise when Berkshire reveals new investments because some investors consider it a vote of confidence by Buffett. In contrast, Berkshire eliminated its stake in Deere, which it had originally bought two years ago.Berkshire did not disclose what investments were made by Buffett's portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler.Buffett has said he generally makes Berkshire's larger investments such as Wells Fargo & Co and Coca-Cola Co , while Combs or Weschler, who have smaller sums to invest, make other investments, especially in sectors he is less familiar with. Other changes to Berkshire's stock portfolio simply adjusted already-existing positions.Berkshire raised its share stakes in several companies including DirecTV, General Motors, MasterCard and Suncor Energy. It also cut its share stakes in Bank of New York Mellon, ConocoPhillips, National Oilwell Varco and Phillips 66.U.S. regulators require large investors each quarter to disclose their stock holdings, offering a window to their investment strategies.The view is limited because investors are not required to list short positions, foreign holdings and bonds, and because it reflects the just-completed quarter.Berkshire ended September with about $118.9 billion of equities, the vast majority of which are on U.S. exchanges.It also owns more than 80 businesses ranging from ice cream to insurance to railroads.

192,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Wells Fargo & Co and the U.S. Department of Justice are ""no longer as optimistic"" about settling a lawsuit accusing the country's largest mortgage lender of fraud, a lawyer for the bank said on Tuesday.Douglas Baruch, a lawyer for Wells Fargo, told a federal judge in Manhattan that while the parties would not rule out a settlement, both sides were prepared to resume litigating after putting the case on hold since July.""The parties are no longer as optimistic as they once were,"" he said.Two weeks ago, the San Francisco-based bank disclosed in a regulatory filing that it was in discussions to resolve the lawsuit, filed in 2012, which seeks hundreds of millions of dollars in damages.The U.S. Justice Department says Wells Fargo failed to report more than 6,000 loans that did not meet requirements for insurance under the Federal Housing Administration and failed to properly review early payment defaults. After the complaint was filed, Wells Fargo asked a federal judge in Washington, D.C. to excuse it from the Justice Department's claims. It was rebuffed in 2013, and its appeal also failed.At Tuesday's hearing, U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman expressed dismay that Wells Fargo and the government did not ask his approval in July to formally put the case on hold to pursue settlement talks.While the parties asked for another four months to prepare evidence and expert witnesses, he gave them only two, taking the case into August. ""You took a chance,"" he said. ""You did this at your own peril.""Wells Fargo spokesman Tom Goyda in a statement said the bank ""will move forward with presenting our case in support of our prudent and responsible FHA lending practices.""A spokeswoman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, whose office is pursuing the civil lawsuit, declined comment. The case was one of several Bharara's office brought against banks over related issues. Most recently, JPMorgan Chase & Co in February agreed to pay $614 million in a similar case.In 2012, Bharara's office obtained settlements for $158.3 million from Citigroup Inc, $132.8 million from Flagstar Bancorp Inc and $202.3 million from Deutsche Bank AG.The case is U.S. v.

193,"   By Suzanne Barlyn  Wells Fargo & Co has agreed to pay $7.4 million to settle a class action claim that it unlawfully made brokers who left the firm forfeit bonuses that were deferred as part of their retirement plans, court documents show.The deal comes more than a year after two former brokers for Wells Fargo Advisors, LLC sued the firm in a class action lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The brokers, Kennison Wakefield and William Stonhaus, challenged a provision of the firm's compensation plan that required them to forfeit certain deferred bonuses if they left Wells to work for competitors. The brokers, who said they had earned the bonuses by meeting performance goals set by Wells, alleged the forfeiture requirement violated California and North Dakota state laws, according to court documents filed on Nov. 13. Spokesmen for Wells Fargo could not be immediately reached for comment. Wells Fargo has not imposed the forfeiture policy for its California and North Dakota brokers since 2012 and does not plan to do so, according to the settlement document.Wakefield left Wells in 2011 and now works for Morgan Stanley, according to regulatory document. Stonhaus joined a unit of UBS AG in 2008. A lawyer for the plaintiffs declined to comment. About 135 brokers in California and North Dakota could share in a $5.6 million fund under terms of the proposed deal, which is subject to court approval. The remaining sum, nearly $1.9 million, will cover legal fees and expenses. A hearing about the settlement is set for Dec. 18.

206,"  (Refiles to fix formatting)By Lianting TuSINGAPORE, Nov 28 (IFR) - Industrial and Commercial Bank of China is poised to launch its much-anticipated US$5.7bn debut Additional Tier 1 offering in three different currencies, in a bid to target the widest possible investor base and increase its pricing power.The Basel III-compliant contingent capital offering will be only the second offshore issue of its kind from mainland China, following Bank of China's US$6.5bn AT1 sold in mid-October. While that deal comprised a single tranche and was taken up mainly by investors in Greater China, however, ICBC is planning to issue in three currencies - US dollars, euros, and offshore renminbi.ICBC will meet global investors until Tuesday for the 144A/Reg S offering, suggesting that the deal could be launched to the market as early as next week. The tranches are likely to be sized US$2.5bn, 1bn euros and Rmb12bn, making the renminbi portion the largest Dim Sum bond from any issuer other than the Chinese sovereign, and by far the biggest single tranche in that market.S&P is expected to rate ICBC's prefs BB, one notch higher than the BB- it assigned to Bank of China's pref shares. Moody's would rate ICBC's proposed prefs at Ba2, the same rating it gave BOC's paper. The two deals share a similar structure.Investors generally see ICBC as a stronger credit than Bank of China. For one, ICBC is the largest bank in China by many categories including assets, loans, deposits, profits and its common equity base. It is among the Chinese banks that have the highest capital adequacy ratios with total capital adequacy ratio and Tier 1 capital ratios of 14.2% and 11.8%, respectively, as at September 30, compared to BOC's 13.07% and 9.37%.For those reasons, investors generally think the ICBC AT1 should price 20bp-30bp inside the BOC AT1, which had rallied to around 6.25% bid yield-to-call on Friday from a reoffer yield of 6.75%.""ICBC is arguably the strongest of China's Big Four banks and as such, leaving technicals aside, the proposed ICBC AT1's yield should reflect this versus the existing Bank of China AT1s,"" said Swee Ching Lim, Singapore-based analyst at Western Asset Management. Now that BOC has set a benchmark for Chinese AT1s, investors have become more comfortable with this new instrument, which has created a positive backdrop for ICBC, market participants said.In fact, indications of interest for its euro and offshore renminbi tranches have already covered the books for those tranches, according to a source familiar with the deal: ""Lots of IOIs came from Chinese conglomerates that have assets in euros or have offshore renminbi reserves.""Test for Dim SumThe planned Rmb12bn (US$2bn) tranche will be the first Basel III-eligible AT1 offering denominated in offshore renminbi. It is also double the biggest single tranche Dim Sum bond ever issued - a Rmb6bn three-year from China's Ministry of Finance in 2011.""The bank is keen to issue a sizable Dim Sum tranche, which seems to carry the political agenda of deepening the CNH market,"" said a Singapore-based portfolio manager who met the issuer a few weeks ago. Analysts generally believe there will be sufficient offshore renminbi liquidity to absorb such a chunky size. But given how the BOC deal was placed, they doubt pricing will be market-driven.""Based on the minimum interest from global investors and fund managers for BOC's AT1, we wonder whether pricing for ICBC's AT1 is going to be reflective of what institutional investors are willing to accept,"" said David Marshall, Singapore-based senior analyst at CreditSights.BOC's US$6.5bn AT1 relied heavily on Asian insurers and sovereign-linked investors, with 94% of the bonds staying in Asia and only 14% going to fund managers.For benchmarks, investors will have to look at offshore renminbi Tier 2 instruments from ICBC and China Construction Bank. CCB's latest Rmb2bn 10-year non-call five T2, sold in early November to yield 4.9%, was indicated last week at 4.7%. Given the spread between BOC's T2 and AT1 notes of about 140bp, fair value for ICBC's renminbi tranche seems to exceed 6%. Wider distribution?After a concentrated distribution for BOC's AT1, investors are closely watching whether the ICBC deal will have wider sponsorship from global institutional investors. The fact that US investors bought 27% of Bank of China's US$3bn 10-year bullet T2 in early November may be an encouraging sign, but investors still believe AT1 is a completely different animal.""It is difficult to predict US involvement in the proposed ICBC AT1s given, unlike the recently printed BOC T2s which also had a 144A component to it, the AT1s are likely not index-eligible, are governed by Chinese law and are in preference share format,"" Lim of Western Asset Management said.Some analysts, however, believe global investors are warming up to Chinese financials as issuance from the sector continues to grow.""At the end of the day, US investors can no longer ignore the Chinese bank sector,"" said Oscar Chow, Hong Kong-based head of Asia credit research at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities. ""Chinese financials have issued about US$30bn of US dollar bonds this year (including senior paper), up over four times versus 2013, and the volume is only going to grow in the future.""CoCos of top-tier US banks such as Wells Fargo and JP Morgan, whose AT1s are rated investment grade, were indicated at low-to-mid 5%, while lower-rated Deutsche Bank, for example, sold its debut Yankee US$1.5bn AT1 (Ba3/BB/BB+) last week at a hefty yield of 7.5%.""When you look from a global perspective where some leading European bank AT1s are yielding more than 7%, I wonder if Chinese bank AT1s offer good value in the 6% range,"" CreditSights' Marshall said. He warned that investors needed to recognise the loss-absorption and coupon deferral risks, as well as the general slowing Chinese economy and worsening asset quality of banks there.ICBC International is sole global co-ordinator and joint bookrunner with Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and UBS.

210,"   By Peter Rudegeair | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Ally Financial Inc (ALLY.N) became the largest U.S. retail auto lender in the third quarter, displacing Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) for the first time since the start of 2013, according to a report from Experian Automotive on Monday.Much of Ally's growth came from financing used car sales, an area where the former in-house finance arm of General Motors Co (GM.N) has been aggressively expanding. The lender extended a record amount of used car loans in the third quarter. In recent years, banks expanded in the used car market as carmakers' in-house finance arms came to dominate the new car market. In the third quarter, 54.1 percent of used car purchases were financed with a loan, a record high.  Banks and other lenders have also been willing to finance larger amounts for used car purchases. The average size of a used car loan in the third quarter was up nearly 4 percent from a year earlier to $18,576, an all-time high, even as used car prices fell in the quarter, according to the Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index.Focusing on consumers buying used cars is riskier for banks because these borrowers tend to have lower credit scores and are more likely to default. The average credit score for a borrower buying a used car in the quarter was 650, compared with 713 for those buying a new car. Credit scores can range from 300 to 850, and scores below 600 are considered subprime by Experian Automotive.   Banks are accepting lower compensation for the increased credit risk. Interest rates for used car loans across the industry fell 0.09 percentage points to 8.54 percent, while rates for new car loans rose 0.20 percentage points to 4.47 percent in the third quarter. As a group, banks extended 2.1 percent more auto loans to subprime borrowers in the quarter, the most of any type of lender.  Ally, along with Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N), Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc (SC.N), GM Financial and other lenders are the targets of investigations into subprime auto lending practices.

213,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Wells Fargo & Co, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, is set to go to trial on Monday as homeowners seek to recoup about $629 million for alleged overcharges by a company once owned by Wachovia Corp.Jury selection is scheduled to begin in federal court in Manhattan in a long-running class-action lawsuit concerning HomEq Servicing, a subprime mortgage servicer.The lawsuit was filed in 2001 on behalf of borrowers whose mortgages were owned or serviced by HomEq or the lender whose loans it was established to manage, Money Store.Wachovia in 2006 sold HomEq to Barclays Plc, which in turn in 2010 sold the mortgage servicing business to Ocwen Financial Corp. Wells Fargo bought Wachovia at the end of 2008 and thus never owned HomEq, but a spokesman confirmed it remained liable for some claims raised in the lawsuit. Ocwen in a statement said it did not have similar liability. Barclays  declined to comment.The lawsuit filed by Joseph Mazzei, a California resident, contends that HomEq kept charging borrowers monthly late fees even after their mortgages went into default, making the full amounts owed immediately due. It also said HomEq violated its contracts by charging attorneys' fees in foreclosure and bankruptcy and splitting them with a nonlawyer, specifically a unit of Fidelity National Information Services Inc.

214,"  (Repeats story sent earlier with no changes to text)By Nate RaymondNEW YORK Dec 8 Wells Fargo & Co, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, is set to go to trial on Monday as homeowners seek to recoup about $629 million for alleged overcharges by a company once owned by Wachovia Corp.Jury selection is scheduled to begin in federal court in Manhattan in a long-running class-action lawsuit concerning HomEq Servicing, a subprime mortgage servicer.The lawsuit was filed in 2001 on behalf of borrowers whose mortgages were owned or serviced by HomEq or the lender whose loans it was established to manage, Money Store. Wachovia in 2006 sold HomEq to Barclays Plc, which in turn in 2010 sold the mortgage servicing business to Ocwen Financial Corp.Wells Fargo bought Wachovia at the end of 2008 and thus never owned HomEq, but a spokesman confirmed it remained liable for some claims raised in the lawsuit. Ocwen in a statement said it did not have similar liability. Barclays  declined to comment. The lawsuit filed by Joseph Mazzei, a California resident, contends that HomEq kept charging borrowers monthly late fees even after their mortgages went into default, making the full amounts owed immediately due.It also said HomEq violated its contracts by charging attorneys' fees in foreclosure and bankruptcy and splitting them with a nonlawyer, specifically a unit of Fidelity National Information Services Inc. Sharing fees in this manner is illegal throughout the country, the lawsuit said. In an October court filing, a damages expert for the plaintiffs estimated damages at $59.3 million for late fees and $282.7 million for attorneys' fees, plus pre-judgment interest of $287.4 million.""We strongly disagree with and dispute the plaintiff's claims and legal arguments, which relate to acts that occurred at a legacy company more than a decade ago, and are prepared to present our case in court."" Wells Fargo spokesman Tom Goyda said.Moshe Horn, a lawyer for the plaintiffs at Seeger Weiss, declined to comment.The case is Mazzei v. The Money Store, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 01-5694.

216,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Wells Fargo & Co, (WFC.N) the largest U.S. mortgage lender, is set to go to trial on Monday as homeowners seek to recoup about $629 million for alleged overcharges by a company once owned by Wachovia Corp.   Jury selection is scheduled to begin in federal court in Manhattan in a long-running class-action lawsuit concerning HomEq Servicing, a subprime mortgage servicer.The lawsuit was filed in 2001 on behalf of borrowers whose mortgages were owned or serviced by HomEq or the lender whose loans it was established to manage, Money Store.Wachovia in 2006 sold HomEq to Barclays Plc (BARC.L), which in turn in 2010 sold the mortgage servicing business to Ocwen Financial Corp (OCN.N). Wells Fargo bought Wachovia at the end of 2008 and thus never owned HomEq, but a spokesman confirmed it remained liable for some claims raised in the lawsuit. Ocwen in a statement said it did not have similar liability. Barclays  declined to comment.The lawsuit filed by Joseph Mazzei, a California resident, contends that HomEq kept charging borrowers monthly late fees even after their mortgages went into default, making the full amounts owed immediately due.It also said HomEq violated its contracts by charging attorneys' fees in foreclosure and bankruptcy and splitting them with a nonlawyer, specifically a unit of Fidelity National Information Services Inc (FIS.N). Sharing fees in this manner is illegal throughout the country, the lawsuit said. In an October court filing, a damages expert for the plaintiffs estimated damages at $59.3 million for late fees and $282.7 million for attorneys' fees, plus pre-judgment interest of $287.4 million.""We strongly disagree with and dispute the plaintiff's claims and legal arguments, which relate to acts that occurred at a legacy company more than a decade ago, and are prepared to present our case in court."" Wells Fargo spokesman Tom Goyda said. Moshe Horn, a lawyer for the plaintiffs at Seeger Weiss, declined to comment.The case is Mazzei v. The Money Store, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 01-5694.

217,"   By Elizabeth Dilts | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Wells Fargo Advisors, Wells Fargo & Co's securities brokerage, hired a Chicago-area team of brokers away from rival UBS AG's wealth management unit, where they managed $463 million in client assets and generated $3.5 million in annual fees and commissions. James Percifield, David Heeren and Brad Harber, whose team works under the name Madison Street Financial Group, joined Wells Fargo on Nov. 21 from UBS. The team will work out of two offices, with Heeren based in downtown Chicago and Percifield and Harber opening a new branch in Chesterton, Indiana, about an hour's drive southeast of the city.  Heeren said more than half of the assets Madison Street Financial Group manages come from corporate retirement plans, with the rest coming from high net worth families.  Heeren told Reuters the group chose to move to Wells at this time because it is in the process of adding another adviser and wanted to transition to Wells before the holidays.A UBS spokesman declined to comment.

The trio, who managed more than $220 million in client assets, joins Raymond James's office in St. Louis, Missouri, the company said in a statement on Friday. Bry began his career as a financial adviser in the late 1960s and his son joined the business in 1985. Wells Fargo was not immediately available for comment.

219,"   By Jed Horowitz  When the almost 11,000 financial advisers in Wells Fargo & Co's branch brokerage system get their 2015 compensation plan on Wednesday they may grimace at one change that could hit their pay, or cost their customers a little more.Wells is raising the minimum commission size on which it will allow brokers to be paid on a stock trade to $125 from $95, according to people familiar with the plan. Wells brokers, who receive 50 percent of most of the commissions they charge, risk customer backlash for the higher charge. A $30 rise in the so-called ticket charge may not sound egregious but transactions can quickly add up. For example, a broker closing out a $400,000 managed account portfolio of a deceased client or rebalancing positions could easily execute 50 transactions, costing an extra $1,500, said one of the sources.Brokers at Wells and other full-service firms still have leeway to offer discounts to selected clients from published rates, but all firms are putting constraints on behaviors that they say erode profitability.  Morgan Stanley, the largest U.S. brokerage firm with more than 16,000 advisers, for example, does not credit brokers for purchases or sales of securities that trade below $1 a share or on products, other than options, that have commissions under $100 a trade, according to its 2015 compensation plan. Wells is the last of the four big U.S. brokerage firms to issue its annual compensation plan, a document that can run dozens of pages and is scrutinized internally and at competitors to see where the most attractive deals lie and what sales behaviors are being encouraged or discouraged. Morgan Stanley, Bank of America's Merrill Lynch Wealth Management and UBS Wealth Management Americas  distributed plans in the past month that offer inducements for working on teams and penalties for discounting fees and commissions and for working with small accounts.In addition to raising its compensable trading ticket size, the new Wells plan will make it more remunerative for lower-producing brokers to work on teams, the sources said. Some Wells brokers have complained that the firm was constraining their ability to manage their teams. Full-service firms are promoting teams as a superior way to handle the sophisticated needs of wealthy clients, with the added benefit of making it harder for teams to bolt en masse to competitors.(This version of the story has corrected the headline to say Wells Fargo is not changing commission rates but raising minimum commission size for broker payouts) (Reporting by Jed Horowitz in New York; editing by Andrew Hay)",2014-12-17,WFC,"Tue Dec 16, 2014 | 11:46pm EST",Wells to raise minimum stock commission size for FAs,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-wells-far-broker-pay-idUSKBN0JV02V20141217?type=companyNews
220,"   By Suzanne Barlyn  Two brokerage units of Wells Fargo & Co must pay a joint $1.5 million fine for failing to comply with anti-money laundering regulations by not verifying 220,000 new accounts during a nine-year period, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) said on Thursday.The lapses, at Wells Fargo Advisors and Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network, occurred between 2003 and 2012, according to FINRA, the Wall Street watchdog. Wells Fargo & Co neither admitted nor denied FINRA's allegations, the regulator said.FINRA rules require brokerages to have policies and procedures in place to comply with a federal law aimed at detecting and curbing money laundering. A computer system at Wells Fargo, however, contained a design flaw that caused failures in identifying some accounts as new, FINRA said. The problem affected more than 3 percent of the 6.9 million customer accounts the two units had opened during the nine-year period, FINRA said in its settlement with Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo uncovered the problem through routine compliance testing, according to the settlement document.A Wells Fargo spokesman declined to comment.

222,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. homeowners suing mortgage companies once owned by a bank Wells Fargo & Co later acquired won a $54.8 million verdict on Friday in a class action over excessive fees.The verdict, by a federal jury in Manhattan, came in a long-running lawsuit by borrowers whose mortgages were owned or serviced by HomEq Serving or the lender whose loans it was established to manage, the now-defunct The Money Store.Wells Fargo said afterward that it disagreed with the jury's decision and would likely seek further court review.A lawyer for the homeowners, Moshe Horn, said in a statement that he was ""thrilled our clients finally had our day in court.""Homeowners, who sued in 2001, had sought to recoup about $629 million for alleged overcharges and interest, according to an October court filing by a damages expert for the plaintiffs. The lawsuit was filed by homeowner Joseph Mazzei, who contends that The Money Store and HomEq kept charging borrowers monthly late fees even after their mortgages went into default.According to court records, the jury found the mortgage companies liable for the late fees but not liable on a separate question of whether the companies mishandled attorney fees.Wells Fargo spokesman Tom Goyda said in a statement that while the bank would likely seek a review of the part of the case it lost, ""We are pleased that the jury rejected a significant portion of the plaintiff's claims."" Mazzei was awarded $133.80 plus interest, records showed.  If the verdict stands, the $54.8 million will be split up among the class at a later date.Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, never owned either defendant. Wells Fargo in 2008 acquired Wachovia, which had owned HomEq. The Money Store was owned by First Union, which later became part of Wachovia.First Union shut down The Money Store in 2000 because of losses. A New Jersey mortgage lender bought The Money Store's name in 2006 and has continued using it.The case is Mazzei v.

223,"  (Adds comment from homeowners' lawyer, 4th paragraph)By Nate RaymondNEW YORK Dec 19 U.S. homeowners suing mortgage companies once owned by a bank Wells Fargo & Co later acquired won a $54.8 million verdict on Friday in a class action over excessive fees.The verdict, by a federal jury in Manhattan, came in a long-running lawsuit by borrowers whose mortgages were owned or serviced by HomEq Serving or the lender whose loans it was established to manage, the now-defunct The Money Store.Wells Fargo said afterward that it disagreed with the jury's decision and would likely seek further court review.A lawyer for the homeowners, Moshe Horn, said in a statement that he was ""thrilled our clients finally had our day in court."" Homeowners, who sued in 2001, had sought to recoup about $629 million for alleged overcharges and interest, according to an October court filing by a damages expert for the plaintiffs.The lawsuit was filed by homeowner Joseph Mazzei, who contends that The Money Store and HomEq kept charging borrowers monthly late fees even after their mortgages went into default. According to court records, the jury found the mortgage companies liable for the late fees but not liable on a separate question of whether the companies mishandled attorney fees.Wells Fargo spokesman Tom Goyda said in a statement that while the bank would likely seek a review of the part of the case it lost, ""We are pleased that the jury rejected a significant portion of the plaintiff's claims.""Mazzei was awarded $133.80 plus interest, records showed.  If the verdict stands, the $54.8 million will be split up among the class at a later date. Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, never owned either defendant.Wells Fargo in 2008 acquired Wachovia, which had owned HomEq. The Money Store was owned by First Union, which later became part of Wachovia.First Union shut down The Money Store in 2000 because of losses.

229,"   By Sarah N.

The losses on these investments, the NCUA said, eventually led those five credit unions to fail.Regulators said Wells Fargo, as trustee for those trusts, had obligations under the law to correct problems with the loans and to protect the credit unions' interests.

234,"   By Peter Rudegeair and Amrutha Gayathri  Wells Fargo & Co, the fourth largest U.S. bank by assets, reported a slight increase in quarterly profit on Wednesday as it earned more from credit cards and corporate loans.Credit cards, one of Wells Fargo's major areas of expansion, were a bright spot as fees rose 12 percent to $925 million in the fourth quarter. Outstanding balances increased 16 percent to $31.1 billion, after its purchase of the loan portfolio of Dillard's Inc.One of the fastest-growing industries in its loan book in recent quarters has been energy. On a conference call with analysts, finance chief John Shrewsberry downplayed the effects that the sharp fall in oil prices would have on the bank's energy customers.""Nothing obviously has revealed itself yet,"" said Shrewsberry. He added that the bank did not set aside any money in the quarter for possible energy loan defaults, but was reviewing customers' creditworthiness on a loan-by-loan basis.  Commercial and industrial loans jumped 15 percent to $271.8 billion, much of it coming from an increase in lending to other financial companies, including $6.5 billion in loans to finance the sale of a Wells Fargo student loan portfolio to Navient Corp. That sale resulted in a $217 million gain for the bank in the quarter. Net interest income, a measure of overall profit from lending, was up 3.5 percent to $11.2 billion from the same period a year earlier. Core loans were up 8 percent from the fourth quarter of 2013. Total net income for common shareholders was $5.38 billion, or $1.02 per share, up incrementally from a year earlier and in line with estimates from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, reported a 4 percent fall in income from that unit. The bank made $44 billion in home loans in the quarter, 12 percent less than a year ago and a bigger drop than the one reported by rival JP Morgan Chase & Co. Shrewsberry said he expected mortgage volumes in the first quarter to be relatively constant, though they could get a boost if mortgage rates stay low. Wells Fargo's shares were down 1.7 percent to $50.97, as the broader market tumbled. The bank's stock jumped by 21 percent in 2014, triple the rise of the KBW index of bank stocks.

235,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 14 (Fitch) Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) reported $5.7 billion in  net income for a Return on Assets (ROA) of 1.36%, essentially unchanged from the  prior quarter. Earnings were supported by higher spread income and lower taxes,  partially offset by increased loan loss provisioning and higher noninterest  expenses. Fitch Ratings views these results as consistent with WFC's credit  profile, with ratings that remain among the highest in the world, supported  primarily by its superior earnings profile. WFC's more commercial bank-focused  business model continues to help set itself apart from its large bank peers,  with less exposure to volatile capital markets revenues and while not immune,  much lower litigation-related expenses than other large bank peers. Higher spread income was supported by average earning asset growth of 3%  linked-quarter. The net interest margin (NIM) contracted 2bps in 4Q'14, a level  below the prior quarters NIM compression. The compression was attributed to last  quarter's liquidity-related actions and deposit growth. WFC continues to report  very strong core deposit growth, up 7% from a year ago. WFC reported strong core loan growth in 4Q'14, driven by organic growth, $6.5  billion in financing related to the sale of government guaranteed student loans,  and the acquisition of Dillard's credit card portfolio. Somewhat offsetting  this, auto growth slowed during the quarter. Over the prior four quarters, this  book had been growing on average by about a $1.4 billion a quarter. However,  citing the company's risk and price discipline in a competitive market  environment, automobile loans increased by roughly $500 million. Overall noninterest income was flat on a linked-quarter basis. Higher investment  banking fees, a $217 million gain on the sale of student loans, and higher trust  and investment fees were offset by lower deposit service charges, mortgage  banking revenues and market-sensitive revenues.  Mortgage banking revenues declined 7% on a sequential basis reflecting a  typically slow quarter. However, with the drop in the 10 year in mid-October and  then again in December, this helped lead to an increase in the application  pipeline, with refinancings accounting for 52% of applications, which represents  a nice uptick over prior quarters.  Market-sensitive revenues, which include gains and losses on equity investments,  trading activities, and debt securities, declined 35%, following a strong 3Q'14  in which WFC realized over $700 million in net gains from equity investments,  primarily from Norwest Venture Partners. Period-end trading assets increased by  $10.5 billion or 16% on increased inventory for market making activity. Despite  the increase, trading assets still only account for less than 5% of total  assets, a level well below other large bank peers. Further, the market-sensitive  revenues combined with investment banking fees, were around 6% of total  revenues; once again well below the average for Bank of America, Citi and JPM,  who typically average 25% of revenues. Expenses were up 3% on a sequential basis reflecting higher personnel expenses,  primarily due to higher deferred compensation costs (which are earnings neutral  as offset in trading revenues), and increased equipment expenses and outside  professional fees. This was partially offset by lower operating losses related  to lower litigation accruals. WFC expects to operate within its targeted  efficiency range of 55% to 59% in 2015.  WFC noted that no oil-related charges were incurred in 4Q'14, and gave more  specific information related to energy-related exposure. Lending to oil and gas  businesses totaled around $17 billion (or 2% of total loans), while securities  classified as either trading or available for sale accounted for less than $1.5  billion. These exposures together comprised a manageable 13% of Common Equity  Tier 1 under Basel III. WFC also generates revenues from debt and equity  underwritings, and loan syndication fees. These fees have averaged around $100  million to $300 million over the last several years, a relatively small amount  in the context of quarterly earnings of over $5 billion.  WFC reported a smaller reserve release on a sequential basis of $250 million as  compared to $300 million last quarter. Net charge-offs (NCOs) reflected a still  benign credit environment at just 34bps, up slightly on lower recoveries in  Wholesale. Due primarily to loan growth, provision expenses increased 32%  sequentially. WFC indicated that future loan loss reserve levels will depend on  loan growth and mix, portfolio performance, and general economic conditions.  The estimated Common Equity Tier 1 under Basel III Advanced Approach, fully  phased-in, fell 3bps to a still solid 10.44% at quarter-end. The linked-quarter  decline was due to balance sheet growth.

236,"   By Peter Rudegeair | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Jan 14 Wells Fargo & Co, one of the biggest lenders to U.S. energy companies, is reviewing each of its loans to the sector in the wake of oil prices tumbling 60 percent since last summer, executives said Wednesday.The bank did not think its energy loan portfolio was at risk enough to justify setting aside any money in the fourth quarter to cover possible defaults, Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry told analysts on a Wednesday conference call, adding that energy represented only 2 percent of the banks outstanding loans.He said he expected future loan demand in the industry would ""certainly be down.""Energy clients are taking ""the appropriate evasive actions,"" including preserving cash, cutting costs and trimming debt in light of the plunging oil prices, Shrewsberry said. ""We're ... going customer by customer and working through each situation to figure out what this drop means to them,"" Shrewsberry said.In recent years, the San Francisco-based bank has been one of the beneficiaries of U.S. shale oil and gas discoveries and the fracking boom. It has 500 relationships with energy companies that range from lending money to underwriting debt to taking firms public. The bank has invested around $500 million through funds and direct stakes, executives said at the bank's May 2014 investor day. Wells Fargo's revenue from these clients has grown steadily to $1.04 billion in 2013 from $690 million in 2011.Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf told analysts to focus on the positive aspects of the drop in oil prices like more discretionary income for U.S. consumers. Lower energy prices also could benefit Wells Fargo's merchant banking group as it looks to take part in recapitalizing oil and gas companies that run into trouble or acquiring energy assets from firms that need to sell them quickly, Shrewsberry said in a separate interview with Reuters.""That could be an interesting opportunity as things go forward,"" Shrewsberry said.Wells Fargo, the fourth largest U.S. bank by assets, reported a slight increase in quarterly profit earlier Wednesday as it earned more from credit cards and corporate loans.

247,"   By Aruna Viswanatha and Karen Freifeld | WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  WASHINGTON/NEW YORK A U.S. judge on Monday rejected allegations by the New York state attorney general that Wells Fargo was violating the $25 billion mortgage settlement that federal and state authorities reached with five banks in 2012.U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer described Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's allegations as ""so insubstantial"" that the state failed to allege a breach of the agreement. In 2013, Schneiderman accused Wells Fargo of failing to comply with several mortgage servicing standards as prescribed by the earlier settlement. Under the February 2012 deal, Wells, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc and Ally Financial agreed to pay billions in help to homeowners and reform their mortgage servicing operations in order to atone for abuses in processing foreclosures as the housing market collapsed.By spring 2013, Schneiderman said his office had documented hundreds of violations of the deal by Wells Fargo and in October asked the federal judge overseeing the settlement to force Wells to comply with its terms. New York said the bank was not responding to some struggling borrowers who were seeking loan modifications as quickly as timetables under the settlement required.  In the Monday order, the judge said New York's allegations covered less than .022 percent of New York loans serviced by Wells Fargo, and that a monitor appointed to oversee the settlement could address those issues. The settlement ""does not require absolute perfection in loan servicing,"" Collyer wrote. She said allowing New York to go to court over their concerns ""would open the floodgates to lawsuits, running afoul of the core purpose of the Consent Judgment––to resolve problems in the mortgage industry with monitoring and compliance and without litigation.""Wells Fargo spokesman Tom Goyda said the bank was gratified the court has denied the New York Attorney General’s motion.  A spokesman for Schneiderman, Matt Mittenthal, said his office was disappointed the court did not grant specific relief to consumers, but pointed out the ruling did find that states can sue to enforce the terms of the deal.

263,"  (Recasts headline)By Luciana Lopez, Jonathan Stempel and Jennifer AblanNEW YORK Feb 28 In his 50 years at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, Warren Buffett has transformed a failing textile company into a sprawling conglomerate that has vastly outperformed most of the rest of corporate America.But he now says: Do not expect a repeat of that outperformance in the next 50.In the 84-year-old's annual shareholder letter released on Saturday, Buffett said Berkshire has grown so large - 751,000 times its original net worth per share - that the future pace of gains ""will not come close"" to those of the past.""The numbers have become too big,"" Buffett wrote. ""I think Berkshire will outperform the average American company, but our advantage, if any, won't be great.""Within 10 to 20 years, Buffett said, Berkshire's girth could require whoever then runs the Omaha, Nebraska-based company to consider steps he has resisted, such as paying dividends or conducting ""massive"" share repurchases.Buffett, also addressing one of the more pressing topics at Berkshire, said he and his board of directors ""believe we now have the right person to succeed me as CEO,"" likely for a decade or more, and who in some respects ""will do a better job than I am doing.""While Buffett did not name that person, Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 91, said Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, two top Buffett lieutenants, would be prime candidates.Abel, 52, runs Berkshire Hathaway Energy. Jain, 63, has been Buffett's top insurance executive for three decades.A successor could also be female: Buffett said ""gender should never decide who becomes CEO.""And Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who run some Berkshire investments, ""can be of particular help to the CEO in evaluating acquisitions,"" he added. ""You've got such good candidates,"" said Thomas Russo, a principal at Gardner, Russo & Gardner, which invests 12 percent of its $10 billion of assets in Berkshire. ""I think they'll adopt a different capital structure approach, which will include a healthy, healthy large dividend.""OPERATING RESULTS MISS ESTIMATES Buffett is preparing in May to celebrate 50 years of running Berkshire, whose market value is now $363 billion.On Saturday, Berkshire also reported a 17 percent drop in fourth-quarter profit, to $4.16 billion, or $2,529 per Class A share, from $4.99 billion, or $3,035, a year ago, as investment gains and results from insurance underwriting declined.Operating profit rose 5 percent to $3.96 billion, or $2,412 per share, from $3.78 billion, or $2,297. For all of 2014, profit rose 2 percent to $19.87 billion, while operating profit increased 9 percent to $16.55 billion. Revenue rose 7 percent $194.67 billion.Book value per share, which Buffett considers a good measure of Berkshire's worth, rose 8.3 percent to $146,186 but lagged gains in the Standard & Poor's 500 for the fifth time in six years.Despite the big numbers, Berkshire had some problems.Buffett lamented the performance of the BNSF railroad, saying it ""disappointed many of its customers"" with congestion on its rail lines caused by bad weather, amid rising oil shipments and a bumper grain harvest.He also said he was ""embarrassed"" by taking too long to exit a $2.3 billion investment in Tesco Plc, a British retailer that became mired in an accounting scandal.Berkshire lost $444 million on Tesco, but Buffett said that's just 0.2 percent of its net worth. MOTHER LODE OF OPPORTUNITIES Berkshire owns more than 80 companies, such as Geico insurance and Dairy Queen ice cream, and $117.5 billion of equity investments in such companies as Wells Fargo & Co , Coca-Cola Co, American Express Co and IBM Corp.Buffett remains on the prowl for acquisitions, and with $63.27 billion of cash could make big purchases, which he calls ""elephants,"" while preserving a $20 billion cash cushion.Despite spending $7.8 billion on 31 acquisitions in 2014, Berkshire has not bought an elephant since paying $12.25 billion to buy half of ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co in 2013.And while Buffett has said he may shop more in Germany, after on Feb. 20 agreeing to buy a German motorcycle accessories retailer, Berkshire's main focus will remain at home.""Though we will always invest abroad as well, the mother lode of opportunities runs through America,"" he wrote.Buffett's letter retained the folksy tone that have helped make him popular among investors.Talking about his See's Candies business, which requires little capital investment, Buffett compared the company's profits to ""rabbits breeding.""And Buffett said that at Berkshire's annual meeting last year, part of a weekend he calls ""Woodstock for Capitalists,"" shareholders bought 10,000 bottles of Heinz ketchup with Buffett or Munger on the labels. (Buffett's cost $2, Munger's $1.50.)This year, Buffett said Heinz will also be selling mustard as well as ketchup. ""Buy both!"" he exhorted.

274,"   By Charles Levinson | NEW YORK  NEW YORK In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Keith Higgins was certain: Banks weren’t to blame.Higgins, a top attorney at prominent law firm Ropes & Gray LLP, was chairman of an American Bar Association committee on securities regulation. As such, he lobbied strenuously against a rule U.S. regulators were drafting that would require banks to disclose a lot more about asset-backed securities like those that had just torpedoed the economy.In letters to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Higgins argued that divulging more details about the mortgages and other financial products that go into such securities would only confuse investors. And it was investors, with “insufficient understanding and … commitment” to their investments, who had been the real cause of the crisis, he argued in a July 2008 letter.Then, in May 2013, as the SEC was still hashing out the rule, Higgins was tapped to lead the very 500-person SEC division that was writing it.When the final version of Reg AB II came out last year, disclosure rules advocated by many within the agency had been stripped out. Of particular concern: Banks could continue to sell asset-backed securities to institutional investors on the private market with no new disclosure requirements.Reg AB II was one of many rules Congress ordered up in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act to fill regulatory holes in the market for asset-backed securities. An unprecedented expansion of this multitrillion-dollar market, in which banks repackage mortgages and other assets into complex securities and sell them to investors, lay at the heart of the financial crisis.But as the evolution of Reg AB II suggests, banks and their advocates have managed to preserve many of the industry’s pre-crisis practices by focusing lobbying efforts on obscure corners of the regulatory world, far from the glare of congressional debate or public scrutiny. Many of these agencies are staffed by appointees from the industry they regulate and return to it when their stints are over.“The banks have done an end run around all the disclosure efforts,” said Thomas Adams, a securitization lawyer at Paykin Krieg & Adams LLP.Four of the six lawyers now in the leadership of the American Bar Association committee that Higgins chaired have worked for the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance. And between 1993 and 2006, the proportion of financial services veterans on the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) went from zero to 25 percent, according to a 2012 Harvard Business School study.Higgins declined to comment.SEC Chief of Staff Lona Nallengara said the selection of Higgins to run the division was a reflection of his status as “a respected securities practitioner with 30 years’ experience.”Nallengara, who was acting director of the Division of Corporation Finance for seven months before Higgins took over, said the decision to remove disclosure requirements for private offerings from Reg AB II was made before Higgins arrived. “Keith had no influence on that decision,” he said.SYMPATHETIC EARS Like the SEC when it was weighing rules on asset-backed securities, FASB, the private group that sets accounting standards for public companies, came under political pressure to tighten rules blamed for exacerbating the financial crisis. Critics said FASB had made it too easy for banks to stash mountains of securitized loans in off-balance-sheet vehicles based in the Cayman Islands, hiding their exposure to risks that eventually swamped them and the global economy.Here, too, banks pushed back hard. And here, too, their protests reached sympathetic ears. Ultimately, FASB’s rules barely dented the size of banks’ off-book holdings.The practical effect of these lobbying efforts has been obvious.Thanks to the private-market loophole in the SEC’s Reg AB II, banks are selling a greater share of securitized debt than ever on private markets – largely off the radar of regulators and watchdogs.Residential mortgage-backed securities tendered on the private market jumped to 78 percent of all new offerings last year from 46 percent in 2013 and just 10 percent in 2007, according to data obtained by Thomson Reuters. The privately sold share for commercial mortgage-backed securities jumped to 83 percent from 37 percent in 2013.The markets for asset-backed securities today are a fraction of what they were in the run-up to the crisis. But they are showing strong signs of revival. What bothers some current and former regulators and industry watchers is that much of the regulatory framework that enabled the crisis remains in place.“What’s playing out is exactly what we were worried about,” said Sheila Bair, former chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. “Most everything is going into these private markets where regulations require little visibility of what’s happening.”With their access to off-balance-sheet entities largely preserved, the banks continue to hold vast sums of securitized loans offshore and off their books. Together, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp, Citigroup, Wells Fargo & Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley hold nearly $3.3 trillion of securitized loans in off-balance-sheet entities.“I still think there is significantly more risk there than is being reflected on banks’ balance sheets,” Bair said.It isn’t just the banks. As hedge funds and private equity funds have ramped up high-risk lending in recent years, their use of off-balance-sheet vehicles has ballooned. For example, KKR & Co LP's reported exposure to loss from off-balance-sheet entities has risen tenfold since 2010. A KKR spokesperson said less than half of the firm’s off-balance-sheet entities are composed of corporate loans originated by KKR and securitized into collateralized loan obligations, but declined to provide numbers or other information.Robert W. Stewart, a spokesman for the Financial Accounting Foundation (FAF), the private-sector body that oversees FASB, said the new rules “resulted in a dramatic increase” of the holdings financial firms and companies in other industries keep on their books. “These standards eliminated long-standing exceptions for securitizations, and that reduced the opportunity for work-arounds,” he said. HOLDING THE BAG Even before the crisis, FASB struggled for years with how banks should account for off-balance-sheet entities and the assets held in them.Every additional dollar in assets on a bank’s balance sheet requires holding more idle cash in capital reserves to cover those assets if they drop in value. The increase in reserves means less revenue and earning power and smaller employee bonuses.Off-balance-sheet vehicles free banks to make more loans and build assets without having to add to capital reserves. These assets include all sorts of things: Treasury securities, home and commercial real estate mortgages, auto loans, even “junk” loans used to finance leveraged buyouts. Banks bundle the assets into securities, sell the securities to investors, and then park the assets in separately incorporated off-balance-sheet vehicles.In theory, if one of these vehicles fails because the underlying assets sour – as, for example, when large numbers of homeowners default on their mortgages – the bank does not have to bail it out.In practice, they often do – to preserve their reputations in a lucrative market, and because specific asset-backed securities often carry implicit or explicit guarantees that leave banks legally liable to make investors whole.“Repeatedly, constantly, when the new off-balance-sheet entity got into financial difficulty, the bank bailed out the entity that they supposedly didn’t have any more connection with,” said Halsey Bullen, who was with FASB from 1983 to 2006, much of that time managing financial instruments projects.FASB sought to address the issue several times before the crisis – to no avail. It tightened rules on Special Purpose Entities, the off-balance-sheet vehicles that played a big role in the collapse of Enron Corp in 2001. But banks simply started using alternatives called Qualifying Special Purpose Entities (QSPEs).Again, in 2005, as banks were stuffing huge amounts of securitized subprime mortgages into QSPEs, FASB Chairman Robert Herz began to push for change. Earlier in his career, Herz turned down a shot to be U.S. chief executive officer of accounting giant PriceWaterhouse Coopers, where he was a partner, rather than give up his campaign to remake accounting standards. Now, he wanted to toughen the rules and require banks to put more loans back on their balance sheets.“Clearly there were lots of things that had been given off-balance-sheet treatment that should not have been designated as such,” said Herz. “All the big Wall Street firms were doing it.”Herz was opposed, former FASB officials said, by former JP Morgan Vice President Leslie Seidman – a FASB member known to some of her critics as “Loophole Leslie” for her advocacy of bank-friendly accounting rules.Herz’s effort fizzled out. “I started to realize that some people on the board didn’t want to get anywhere,” said Don Young, a FASB board member at the time.Seidman said she objected to the initial proposals because they would have made the rules more complex and created more exceptions.Then, in 2008, the U.S. housing bubble burst, and with it, the market for mortgage-backed securities. Citigroup announced that it was on the hook for more than $100 billion in loans it had placed in off-balance-sheet vehicles. All told, the biggest U.S. banks wound up bringing back onto their books more than $300 billion of guarantees for off-balance-sheet loans and bonds, according to a report by RiskMetrics Group Inc. The banks paid out billions more in lawsuits to investors demanding that they take responsibility for off-balance-sheet loans.Under pressure from Congress, FASB again took up the issue. Banks bombarded the board with comment letters and tasked full-time staff to sway it as it started drafting new rules.Force banks to report too much lending on their balance sheets, Citigroup, Bank of America and other banks argued, and credit available to ordinary Americans would shrink. Make them disclose too much information about what was going off-balance-sheet, and it would just confuse investors.In September 2008, Young, the FASB member, told a congressional hearing: “There was unending lobbying of the FASB” to preserve banks’ right to continue stashing loans off their balance sheets.Even so, FASB’s draft rules did away with QSPEs. That left something known as a Variable Interest Entity, which carried a tougher standard banks had to meet to secure off-balance-sheet treatment. But then, as the lobbying continued, FASB relaxed the rules for VIEs, essentially closing one loophole while opening another.“The changes were all in the direction of watering it down,” said Marcus Stanley, director of Americans for Financial Reform, a consumer group in Washington, D.C.There are concrete measures of the banks’ lobbying success. When FASB published the first draft of the rules in 2008, Citigroup warned in its annual report that it expected to increase its risk-weighted assets by $100 billion as a result of having to bring loans onto its books.A year later, after FASB issued its final draft of the new rules, Citigroup brought just $24 billion in risk-weighted assets back onto its books. At the time, it had $557.5 billion in off-balance-sheet loans.The new rules took effect on Jan. 1, 2010. The top six U.S. banks brought about $400 billion of loans back onto their books, a 2010 Deloitte Study found, a fraction of the $4 trillion of loans – mostly mortgages – those banks then held off their balance sheets.That August, Herz walked out of a FASB meeting and resigned. He said at the time that he wanted to spend more time with his family. Several people close to him said FAF, the overseer of FASB, forced out Herz amid growing backlash against his tough stances on some accounting rules important to banks.Stewart, the FAF spokesman, declined to comment on the circumstances surrounding Herz’s departure.The six-person committee overseeing the selection process for Herz’s successor included a former chief investment officer of Swiss bank UBS AG; the managing partner of Brown Brothers Harriman & Co, one of the largest private banks in the U.S.; a former American Express vice president; and a lawyer from Brown & Associates, a law firm that caters to financial industry clients.They chose Seidman, the first former bank executive – rather than auditor – to hold the top spot.Bank stocks rose on the news. Seidman’s term at FASB ended in 2013. She is now a director at ratings company Moody’s Corp and on the board of governors of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Wall Street’s self-regulatory group.PRIVATE MATTERS A few months after FASB published the final version of its new accounting rules, the SEC released a draft of Reg AB II.The rule represented regulators’ effort to address a big factor in the financial crisis: lack of information about the mortgages, leveraged loans and other securitized assets that banks had been stuffing into off-balance-sheet entities.Among other things, Dodd-Frank ordered the SEC to “adopt regulations … requiring each issuer of an asset-backed security to disclose, for each tranche or class of security, information regarding the assets backing that security.”An early draft of the rule would have required, for example, that a seller of mortgage-backed securities provide “loan tape” to regulators and investors. That’s an industry term for a breakdown of all the mortgages in a security, including each borrower’s credit history, the loan-to-value ratio of each mortgage, and other measures of risk.The first draft of the rule applied the stricter requirements to securities sold on both the public and the private markets. SEC rules have long distinguished between investments meant for ordinary mom-and-pop investors and those for wealthy, sophisticated institutional investors.The mass-market investments are registered with the SEC and require extensive disclosure before they can be offered to the public. The private investments typically aren’t registered with the SEC, carry scant disclosure requirements and are sold to “accredited investors” considered savvy enough to know what they are buying.That distinction fell apart during the financial crisis, when it became clear that supposedly sophisticated investors were holding vast stores of toxic mortgage-backed securities. “The disaster was way worse in unregistered private markets during the crisis,” said a senior industry regulator. “Not addressing that market did not seem to be addressing the crisis.”SEC staff overwhelmingly supported the rule, according to people inside the agency. So, too, did two important SEC constituencies: investors, who believed the rule would make it easier to assess the quality of the securities, and ratings agencies, whose failure to accurately rate such securities landed them in hot water in 2008.The banks, however, opposed the early draft. In dozens of comment letters to the SEC, they argued that the additional disclosures would saddle them with an unnecessary and costly burden that would cripple the securitization industry and in turn dry up credit for millions of Americans.Banks were helped by a particularly vocal and effective advocate: the American Bar Association. The ABA’s Committee on the Federal Regulation of Securities – that’s the committee with four former SEC employees – wrote 94 comment letters to the SEC and other regulators after the crisis, making it one of the most prolific commenters on SEC rules. Nearly all of the comments parroted letters from banks and financial industry lobbyists.Higgins, chair of the committee when the SEC started drafting Reg AB II, personally signed 46 of the letters. He also was one of Ropes & Gray’s top securities lawyers, advising clients such as Hasbro Inc and Reebok International Ltd.Time and again, he argued that investors had only themselves to blame for their losses in the financial crisis. “These problems have been compounded in the structured finance markets not by insufficient information, but by insufficient understanding of the information that is already available to investors,” he wrote in one letter. “Rather than needing more information, these investors need both the commitment and the tools to analyze and distill the information that is already available.”The ABA’s lobbying carried particular weight with the SEC because of the banks’ growing reliance on the courts to fight reforms they opposed. In the year that followed 2010 passage of Dodd-Frank, the SEC churned out an average of 5.5 new rule proposals a month, one of the fastest rule-making clips in SEC history. Rules governing swaps, whistleblowers, and reporting of executive compensation were among dozens of proposals the agency issued.Then, on July 22, 2011, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., struck down an unrelated SEC rule mandated by Dodd-Frank that would have made it easier for shareholders to replace company directors. The court said SEC staff hadn’t done a sufficient cost-benefit analysis of the new rule.The ruling, which was sharply critical of the SEC’s rule-making process, “intimidated the agency,” said Barbara Roper, director of investor protection for the Consumer Federation of America and a member of the SEC’s Investor Advisory Committee. SEC rule-making ground to a halt. Since the court decision, the SEC has published less than one new draft rule a month.In May 2013, one month after Mary Jo White was sworn in as SEC chairwoman, she tapped Higgins to be director of the agency’s Division of Corporation Finance, in charge of writing the rule he had lobbied against. Some inside the SEC were shocked.Higgins was close to White’s husband, John White, a partner at Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP who had himself chaired the SEC division when Higgins was head of the ABA committee, according to people who know both men.John White and Mary Jo White declined to comment.On August 27 last year, 52 months after the original draft proposal of Reg AB II was floated, the SEC adopted the final version. The 683-page rule detailed a raft of new disclosure requirements for asset-backed securities – but only for those registered with the SEC for general offer to the public. For the same securities sold on the private market, disclosure requirements remained scant.SEC Chair White said the new rules would ensure that investors “have full information, the tools and the time to understand potential investments and the nature and extent of associated risks.”In the end, 2014 saw a bigger share than ever of asset-backed securities being sold on private markets, with little disclosure or regulatory oversight.

275,"  (For more Reuters Special Reports, double-click on )By Charles LevinsonNEW YORK, April 9 In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Keith Higgins was certain: Banks weren't to blame.Higgins, a top attorney at prominent law firm Ropes & Gray LLP, was chairman of an American Bar Association committee on securities regulation. As such, he lobbied strenuously against a rule U.S. regulators were drafting that would require banks to disclose a lot more about asset-backed securities like those that had just torpedoed the economy.In letters to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Higgins argued that divulging more details about the mortgages and other financial products that go into such securities would only confuse investors. And it was investors, with ""insufficient understanding and  commitment"" to their investments, who had been the real cause of the crisis, he argued in a July 2008 letter.Then, in May 2013, as the SEC was still hashing out the rule, Higgins was tapped to lead the very 500-person SEC division that was writing it.When the final version of Reg AB II came out last year, disclosure rules advocated by many within the agency had been stripped out. Of particular concern: Banks could continue to sell asset-backed securities to institutional investors on the private market with no new disclosure requirements.Reg AB II was one of many rules Congress ordered up in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act to fill regulatory holes in the market for asset-backed securities. An unprecedented expansion of this multitrillion-dollar market, in which banks repackage mortgages and other assets into complex securities and sell them to investors, lay at the heart of the financial crisis.But as the evolution of Reg AB II suggests, banks and their advocates have managed to preserve many of the industry's pre-crisis practices by focusing lobbying efforts on obscure corners of the regulatory world, far from the glare of congressional debate or public scrutiny. Many of these agencies are staffed by appointees from the industry they regulate and return to it when their stints are over.""The banks have done an end run around all the disclosure efforts,"" said Thomas Adams, a securitization lawyer at Paykin Krieg & Adams LLP.Four of the six lawyers now in the leadership of the American Bar Association committee that Higgins chaired have worked for the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance. And between 1993 and 2006, the proportion of financial services veterans on the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) went from zero to 25 percent, according to a 2012 Harvard Business School study.Higgins declined to comment.SEC Chief of Staff Lona Nallengara said the selection of Higgins to run the division was a reflection of his status as ""a respected securities practitioner with 30 years' experience.""Nallengara, who was acting director of the Division of Corporation Finance for seven months before Higgins took over, said the decision to remove disclosure requirements for private offerings from Reg AB II was made before Higgins arrived. ""Keith had no influence on that decision,"" he said.SYMPATHETIC EARS Like the SEC when it was weighing rules on asset-backed securities, FASB, the private group that sets accounting standards for public companies, came under political pressure to tighten rules blamed for exacerbating the financial crisis. Critics said FASB had made it too easy for banks to stash mountains of securitized loans in off-balance-sheet vehicles based in the Cayman Islands, hiding their exposure to risks that eventually swamped them and the global economy.Here, too, banks pushed back hard. And here, too, their protests reached sympathetic ears. Ultimately, FASB's rules barely dented the size of banks' off-book holdings.The practical effect of these lobbying efforts has been obvious.Thanks to the private-market loophole in the SEC's Reg AB II, banks are selling a greater share of securitized debt than ever on private markets - largely off the radar of regulators and watchdogs.Residential mortgage-backed securities tendered on the private market jumped to 78 percent of all new offerings last year from 46 percent in 2013 and just 10 percent in 2007, according to data obtained by Thomson Reuters. The privately sold share for commercial mortgage-backed securities jumped to 83 percent from 37 percent in 2013.The markets for asset-backed securities today are a fraction of what they were in the run-up to the crisis. But they are showing strong signs of revival. What bothers some current and former regulators and industry watchers is that much of the regulatory framework that enabled the crisis remains in place.""What's playing out is exactly what we were worried about,"" said Sheila Bair, former chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. ""Most everything is going into these private markets where regulations require little visibility of what's happening.""With their access to off-balance-sheet entities largely preserved, the banks continue to hold vast sums of securitized loans offshore and off their books. Together, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp, Citigroup, Wells Fargo & Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley hold nearly $3.3 trillion of securitized loans in off-balance-sheet entities.""I still think there is significantly more risk there than is being reflected on banks' balance sheets,"" Bair said.It isn't just the banks. As hedge funds and private equity funds have ramped up high-risk lending in recent years, their use of off-balance-sheet vehicles has ballooned. For example, KKR & Co LP's reported exposure to loss from off-balance-sheet entities has risen tenfold since 2010. A KKR spokesperson said less than half of the firm's off-balance-sheet entities are composed of corporate loans originated by KKR and securitized into collateralized loan obligations, but declined to provide numbers or other information.Robert W. Stewart, a spokesman for the Financial Accounting Foundation (FAF), the private-sector body that oversees FASB, said the new rules ""resulted in a dramatic increase"" of the holdings financial firms and companies in other industries keep on their books. ""These standards eliminated long-standing exceptions for securitizations, and that reduced the opportunity for work-arounds,"" he said. HOLDING THE BAG Even before the crisis, FASB struggled for years with how banks should account for off-balance-sheet entities and the assets held in them.Every additional dollar in assets on a bank's balance sheet requires holding more idle cash in capital reserves to cover those assets if they drop in value. The increase in reserves means less revenue and earning power and smaller employee bonuses.Off-balance-sheet vehicles free banks to make more loans and build assets without having to add to capital reserves. These assets include all sorts of things: Treasury securities, home and commercial real estate mortgages, auto loans, even ""junk"" loans used to finance leveraged buyouts. Banks bundle the assets into securities, sell the securities to investors, and then park the assets in separately incorporated off-balance-sheet vehicles.In theory, if one of these vehicles fails because the underlying assets sour - as, for example, when large numbers of homeowners default on their mortgages - the bank does not have to bail it out.In practice, they often do - to preserve their reputations in a lucrative market, and because specific asset-backed securities often carry implicit or explicit guarantees that leave banks legally liable to make investors whole.""Repeatedly, constantly, when the new off-balance-sheet entity got into financial difficulty, the bank bailed out the entity that they supposedly didn't have any more connection with,"" said Halsey Bullen, who was with FASB from 1983 to 2006, much of that time managing financial instruments projects.FASB sought to address the issue several times before the crisis - to no avail.

280,"   By Anil D'Silva and Neha Dimri  Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), the largest U.S. mortgage lender, reported a drop in quarterly profit for the first time in five years as employee costs rose at a time margins are under pressure from low interest rates. Banks are struggling to boost margins as persistent low interest rates and stricter capital requirements offset any benefit from cost-saving initiatives.Low rates have prevented Wells Fargo and its regional rivals from capitalizing on their growing deposit base. Net interest income has also come under pressure as lower-yielding loans replace higher-yielding assets. Wells Fargo's shares fell 2 percent to $53.58 on Tuesday.The bank's net interest margin, a key measure of profitability, fell to 2.95 percent in the first quarter ended March 31 from 3.20 percent a year earlier. Non-interest expense rose about 5 percent to $12.51 billion, mainly because of higher employee costs as the bank expanded its workforce and paid incentives to retirement-eligible employees. Wells Fargo's employee base rose to 266,000 in the quarter, S&P Capital IQ analyst Erik Oja said. The bank had 265,000 employees at the end of 2014. ""But we aren't standing still (on costs),"" Chief Executive John Stumpf said. ""We watch every expense around here as we repurpose dollars we save into things we have to invest in.""The bank, however, reported a better-than-expected profit as mortgage banking revenue rose after four quarters of decline, helped by a surge in refinancing.The average 30-year mortgage rate fell to as low as 3.59 percent in the first quarter, the lowest in nearly two years, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. Rates in the year-earlier quarter averaged 4.35 percent on a monthly basis. Wells Fargo's revenue from mortgage lending rose 2.4 percent to $1.55 billion.The bank said on Friday it was buying commercial real estate loans valued at $9 billion from GE Capital.Mortgage applications in the pipeline surged to $44 billion as of March 31 from $26 billion at December-end. JP Morgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), which also reported results on Tuesday, said quarterly net income from mortgage banking rose nearly three-fold.Net income applicable to Wells Fargo's common shareholders fell about 2.7 percent to $5.46 billion, or $1.04 per share.   Revenue rose 3 percent to $21.28 billion. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 98 cents per share and revenue of $21.24 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Managed account assets at the Wells Fargo Advisors brokerage business grew 12 percent, or $46 billion, to $435 billion in the three months ending March 31. In the year-earlier quarter such assets were up 13 percent.Banks promote fee-based accounts because they provide more profitable and consistent revenue than traditional commission accounts that ebb and flow with market sentiment.  Wells' wealth management results bode well for other large bank-owned brokerages such as Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley that are reporting quarterly results later this week. Although Wells' brokerage force fell by 53 advisers from a year earlier, to 15,134, it prospered in another area dear to bank-owned brokerages, cross-marketing loans to traditional brokerage clients. Average loan balances rose 13.9 percent in the first quarter to $56.9 billion, as brokers and private bankers sold clients' jumbo mortgages and loans collateralized by securities portfolios, Wells said. The lending surge escalated the sector's net interest income by 12.1 percent to $861 million.  In another sign of cross-marketing success, wealth sector clients used 10.44 Wells Fargo products or services per household as of the end of February, the most of Wells' three businesses.

293,"   By Dena Aubin | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Wells Fargo Bank breached a nationwide 2010 legal settlement involving adjustable-payment mortgages, a federal judge ruled, finding that the bank did not properly evaluate homeowners who applied for help to avoid foreclosures.In an order on Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge Richard Seeborg in northern California told Wells to meet with plaintiffs and find a way to remedy its violations, including steps to let some homeowners reapply for loan assistance.Tom Goyda, spokesman for Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, said the bank is reviewing the decision and will be working to provide additional information requested.""We're quite pleased,"" said Jeffrey Berns, lead counsel for homeowners. ""I don't know whether this is going to prevent foreclosures but it is certainly going to open (Wells) up to claims for damages from class members."" The decision is the latest twist in a long-running dispute over the settlement, which resolved complaints about ""pick-a-payment loans."" Wells inherited a large portfolio of these loans with its 2008 acquisition of Wachovia Corp.The loans gave borrowers the option to initially pay less than the interest due, but the escalating payments that came later contributed to waves of home foreclosures in the 2007-2009 housing crisis, which threw the country into recession.Plaintiffs' lawyers for years have argued that Wells was not complying with its agreement to grant loan modifications potentially worth up to $2.7 billion to homeowners who took out the loans.

296,"   By Tom Brown | NEW YORK  NEW YORK An administrative judge hearing an insider trading case against a former Wells Fargo & Co managing director cautioned on Monday that U.S. regulators may have fallen short of tough new requirements for proving insider trading.U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Administrative Law Judge Jason Patil delivered the warning to SEC lawyers after hearing arguments in a civil proceeding against Joseph Ruggieri.Ruggieri, who traded healthcare stocks for Wells Fargo, is accused by the SEC of unlawfully trading on tips about imminent upgrades and downgrades in the ratings of various companies he covered.Since a federal appeals court ruling in December, SEC lawyers and prosecutors face the additional burden of proving that traders knew that the source of inside information received a personal benefit in exchange for sharing non-public information.""With this case, the personal benefit element is a close question,"" Patil said. ""It is an extremely close question.""Ruggieri is accused of having made only about $117,000 in profits for Wells Fargo by trading on tips from April 2010 through March 2011. But his trial has garnered a disproportionate amount of attention because it began soon after the December ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.That ruling has been viewed by securities lawyers as a setback for efforts to curb insider trading on Wall Street because it raised the bar for the SEC and prosecutors in proving the wrongful use of confidential or non-public information.The appeals court also narrowed what constitutes a benefit, saying it must be of ""some consequence"" and something more than just a gesture of friendship. The SEC says Ruggieri received tips from Gregory Bolan, a former Wells Fargo research analyst who has reached a settlement with the SEC. Terms of the settlement have not yet been disclosed.SEC lawyer Alex Vasilescu said in his closing argument that Bolan's friendship with Ruggieri, and need for positive job feedback from him as a mentor who could advance his career,  were enough to meet the 2nd Circuit ruling.Paul Ryan, Ruggieri's lawyer, dismissed the argument as ""preposterous.""  ""The SEC's case is a purely circumstantial one,"" Ryan said in his closing argument. ""This is the mother of all circumstantial cases."" Patil said he would rule in the non-jury case by July 29. Possible civil penalties for insider trading include a fine, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and a bar from the industry.The case is In the Matter of Bolan and Ruggieri, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Administrative Proceeding No. 3-16178.

297,"   By Mike Stone and Lewis Krauskopf  General Electric Co is in early-stage talks with Wells Fargo & Co about selling its entire $74 billion U.S. commercial lending and leasing (CLL) portfolio to the bank, according to a source familiar with the situation.The discussions with Wells Fargo started just last week and other parties may also hold talks with GE about buying the entire U.S. CLL portfolio, the source said. GE is also exploring selling the U.S. CLL portfolio piecemeal and could decide to break the business up, the source added.The source asked not to be identified because the talks are confidential. GE and Wells Fargo declined to comment. The talks with Wells Fargo underscore GE's urgency in looking to dismantle its GE Capital business and free itself from the financial regulatory pressures that come with it. GE earlier this month unveiled plans to exit the bulk of GE Capital over the next few years to focus more on industrial manufacturing. Chief Financial Officer Jeff Bornstein told analysts on the company's quarterly conference call last week that GE was seeing ""incredible"" interest in the GE Capital assets. Some $165 billion of assets have been earmarked for sale.In another sign of the speed with which GE is moving on the plan, it announced earlier this month that it had agreed to sell most of the real estate assets of GE Capital to Blackstone Group LP and Wells Fargo for $23 billion. That deal took less than four weeks to negotiate.  GE's CLL business offers secured commercial loans and equipment financing to primarily midsized companies. Wells Fargo is also active in this sector with a business called Wells Fargo Capital Finance.GE has hired JPMorgan Chase & Co to coordinate the overall finance disposition plan but has brought in more banks to explore the sale of pieces of U.S. CLL, according to people familiar with the matter.  Credit Suisse Group AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc, for example, have been hired to help explore a sale of the equipment and vendor finance business of U.S. CLL, according to people familiar with the matter.GE Capital's size and the potential risks in its lending portfolio made it subject to government regulation as a systemically important financial institution. GE said it would apply to escape that oversight in 2016 as it reduces the financial business' size.

307,"  The city of Los Angeles has sued Wells Fargo & Co, accusing the bank of driving its employees to open unauthorized customer accounts, charging them ""bogus"" fees and damaging their credit, the Los Angeles Times reported.The civil complaint, filed on Monday, says the largest U.S. mortgage lender encouraged employees to engage in ""unfair, unlawful and fraudulent conduct"" through a pervasive culture of high-pressure sales, the newspaper reported. (lat.ms/1R8o6D8) Wells Fargo, in a reply to an email query by Reuters, said it would ""vigorously defend"" the allegations. The lawsuit alleges that employees misused customers' confidential information and often failed to close unauthorized accounts even when customers complained, according to the paper. ""The result is that Wells Fargo has generated a virtual fee-generating machine, through which its customers are harmed, its employees take the blame, and Wells Fargo reaps the profit,"" the report quoted the lawsuit, filed in a Los Angeles court by City Attorney Mike Feuer.

308,"  (Adds Wells Fargo comment)May 5 The city of Los Angeles has sued Wells Fargo & Co, accusing the bank of driving its employees to open unauthorized customer accounts, charging them ""bogus"" fees and damaging their credit, the Los Angeles Times reported.The civil complaint, filed on Monday, says the largest U.S. mortgage lender encouraged employees to engage in ""unfair, unlawful and fraudulent conduct"" through a pervasive culture of high-pressure sales, the newspaper reported. (lat.ms/1R8o6D8) Wells Fargo, in a reply to an email query by Reuters, said it would ""vigorously defend"" the allegations.The lawsuit alleges that employees misused customers' confidential information and often failed to close unauthorized accounts even when customers complained, according to the paper. ""The result is that Wells Fargo has generated a virtual fee-generating machine, through which its customers are harmed, its employees take the blame, and Wells Fargo reaps the profit,"" the report quoted the lawsuit, filed in a Los Angeles court by City Attorney Mike Feuer.

310,"  May 5 The city of Los Angeles has sued Wells Fargo & Co, accusing the bank of driving its employees to open unauthorized customer accounts, charging them ""bogus"" fees and damaging their credit, the Los Angeles Times reported.The civil complaint, filed Monday, says the largest U.S. mortgage lender encouraged its employees to engage in ""unfair, unlawful and fraudulent conduct"" through a pervasive culture of high-pressure sales, according to the LA Times. (lat.ms/1R8o6D8)Wells Fargo did not respond to a request seeking comment outside regular business hours. The lawsuit alleges that employees misused customers' confidential information and often failed to close unauthorized accounts even when customers complained, according to the paper. ""The result is that Wells Fargo has generated a virtual fee-generating machine, through which its customers are harmed, its employees take the blame, and Wells Fargo reaps the profit,"" the report quoted the lawsuit, filed in a Los Angeles court by City Attorney Mike Feuer. Wells Fargo has blamed the problems on a few ""rogue"" employees who the bank has ""appropriately disciplined"" or fired. The city's investigation, however, found only token efforts by the largest California-based bank to prevent customer abuses, the LA Times reported.The lawsuit seeks a court order shutting down the alleged wrongdoing, along with penalties of up to $2,500 for every violation and restitution for customers who were harmed, according to Feuer.

311,"  Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), the largest U.S. mortgage lender, has undertaken a study to streamline five of its key departments, a move that could lead to job losses, the Charlotte Observer reported on Wednesday.The five departments under review include human resources, technology support, finance, communications and marketing, an unnamed source told the Observer, adding that the aim was to find savings that could be reinvested in areas like cyber security, risk and compliance, among others.The company, which announced the move internally last month, took a similar review in 2008 after it bought Wachovia Corp, the Observer added. Wells Fargo could not immediately be reached for comment. The San Francisco-based company last month reported a drop in quarterly profit for the first time in five years as employee costs rose while margins are under pressure from low interest rates.

312,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Friday said it has boosted its holdings in some of the billionaire's favorite companies, including Wells Fargo & Co and International Business Machines Corp.The changes were disclosed in a regulatory filing detailing Berkshire's U.S.-listed stock portfolio as of March 31.Berkshire also boosted its share stake in U.S. Bancorp, another large holding, while other portfolio managers adjusted their stakes in several companies.No new stocks were added to the portfolio, which shrank to $107.1 billion from $109.4 billion in December. Berkshire bought $1.62 billion and sold $1.11 billion of equities overall.Buffett has long praised his ""Big Four"" stock holdings Wells Fargo, IBM, Coca-Cola Co and American Express Co, which comprise roughly 58 percent of Berkshire's equity investments. Buffett has stuck with them despite recent adversity including IBM's stagnant stock price, concern over Coca-Cola's sugary products and executive pay structure, and a February court ruling that American Express violated antitrust law.""Too many fund managers are more interested in seeing stocks to which they have committed perform well"" in the short term, said Andy Kern, a University of Missouri professor who teaches a class on Buffett's investment strategies. ""Berkshire has such a long time horizon that it can afford to watch the stock price go down so it can buy more.""Friday's regulatory filing does not disclose who makes which investment at Berkshire. Smaller investments are often made by portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who may succeed Buffett as chief investment officers after he departs. In the first quarter, Berkshire raised its stake in Wells Fargo by about 2 percent to 470.3 million shares, and in IBM by roughly 3 percent to 79.6 million shares. The U.S. Bancorp stake grew about 5 percent to 83.8 million shares.Other holdings that grew include Deere & Co, Liberty Global Plc, Phillips 66, Precision Castparts Corp and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. Holdings declined in Bank of New York Mellon Corp, Charter Communications Inc, National Oilwell Varco Inc, Viacom Inc and Wabco Holdings Inc.Berkshire also owns more than 80 businesses, including the Burlington Northern railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream and Geico car insurance.Buffett, 84, this month celebrated his 50th anniversary running his Omaha, Nebraska-based company, whose market value is fifth-highest among publicly-traded U.S. companies.

322,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A class of homeowners suing Wells Fargo & Co over excessive fees plans to appeal a judge's ruling tossing a $54.8 million verdict against the bank, their lawyer said on Tuesday.U.S. District Judge John Koeltl in a little-noticed decision on May 29 decertified the class of homeowners, whose mortgages were owned or serviced by the now-defunct Money Store and HomEq Servicing.The lawsuit, filed by homeowner Joseph Mazzei in 2001, alleged the companies improperly overcharged borrowers by assessing late fees even after their mortgages went into default. The homeowners had sought to recoup about $629 million for alleged overcharges and interest, according to an October court filing. Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, never owned Money Store or HomEq but nonetheless found itself facing liability thanks to its 2008 acquisition of Wachovia, HomEq's onetime owner.A federal jury in December returned a mixed verdict in the long-running case against The Money Store and HomEq, which was established to service The Money Store's loans following the closure of its origination business.But in the May 29 decision, Koeltl said the plaintiffs had failed to establish the Money Store defendants had contractual obligations with those homeowners whose loans were only serviced, but not originated, by the companies. While Koeltl said decertifying the class of homeowners post-trial was a drastic step, upholding the verdict ""would be a manifest injustice.""The judge also rejected the plaintiffs' request for a new trial on a separate claim, which jurors had rejected, over whether the companies mishandled attorney fees.""We believe the jury's verdict should stand and we will be appealing,"" the plaintiffs lawyer, Moshe Horn, said. Daniel Pollack, a lawyer for Wells Fargo, on Tuesday referred requests for comment to his client, which did not immediately respond.Wachovia, which Wells Fargo acquired during the financial crisis, had owned HomEq until 2006, when it sold it to Barclays Plc, which in 2010 sold it to Ocwen Financial Corp.The Money Store was owned by First Union, which later became part of Wachovia. First Union shut down The Money Store in 2000 because of losses. A New Jersey mortgage lender bought the Money Store's name in 2006 and has continued using it. The case is Mazzei v.

326,"  WASHINGTON A U.S. bank regulator on Wednesday said it imposed restrictions on mortgage servicing against HSBC, Wells Fargo and four others because they failed to meet all of the requirements of a major settlement.The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) said the new limitations would apply to acquisitions of residential mortgage servicing rights, outsourcing servicing to others, and other related business activities.Mortgage servicers accept payments from borrowers, negotiate loan modifications and pursue foreclosures. They include lenders and outside companies that buy the rights to handle loans.Following the 2007-2009 financial crisis, banks reached a settlement with regulators over their mishandling of servicing activities, including ""robo-signing"", or using defective or fraudulent documents, to pursue home foreclosures.    Wells Fargo and HSBC face the toughest restrictions, the OCC said on Wednesday, and JPMorgan Chase, EverBank, Santander and U.S. Bank also will have certain activities limited. The rules do not prevent banks from making any new loans, the OCC said. Wells Fargo and HSBC each said in separate statements on Wednesday that they had made progress on servicing issues and were continuing to work on fixing the remaining problems.JPMorgan said in a statement that it expected to meet all the requirements by the end of the summer. The regulator said it also planned to take additional actions against the six banks.The OCC said Bank of America, Citigroup and PNC all had met the requirements under the agreement. So far, the settlement has resulted in payments of more than $2.7 billion to borrowers, the OCC said. The regulator said it expected about $280 million to be unclaimed at the end of 2015, and borrowers could access that money through state processes.

329,"   By Suzanne Barlyn  Three major securities brokerages must collectively reimburse customers more than $30 million for failing to waive mutual fund sales charges for thousands of accounts belonging to charities and retirement investors, Wall Street's watchdog said on Monday.Units of Wells Fargo & Co, Raymond James Financial Inc and LPL Financial Holdings Inc ""failed to adequately supervise"" the sale of mutual funds that offered sales charge waivers, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) said in a statement.The firms, in settling the cases with FINRA, neither admitted nor denied the industry-funded regulator's allegations, FINRA said.A Wells Fargo spokesman declined to comment. Raymond James and LPL said in statements that they self-reported the problem to FINRA, which did not impose fines, given the firms' ""extraordinary cooperation."" The overcharges involve Class A shares, which have lower fees than Class B and C shares, but require an initial sales charge. Many mutual funds, however, waive the upfront sales for certain types of retirement accounts and charities.Wells Fargo, Raymond James, and LPL had offered these waivers and disclosed them in their prospectuses, FINRA said. The case is similar to one FINRA brought last year against Bank of America's Merrill Lynch unit, which resulted in the firm paying an $8 million fine.FINRA's Merrill case prompted some firms to review their practices to see whether they also had failed to provide the sales charge discounts that mutual fund issuers had made available to retirement accounts and charities, said Bradley Bennett, FINRA's enforcement chief, in a June interview. The firms had self-reported their overcharges to FINRA, leading to an investigation, Bennett had said at the time without identifying the firms.Wells Fargo, Raymond James and LPL will pay affected customers an estimated $15 million, $8.7 million and $6.3 million, respectively.The errors at the three companies have affected a total of more than 50,000 accounts at the firms since at least 2009, FINRA said.All three firms ""failed to adequately supervise"" the sale of mutual funds that offered sales charge waivers, FINRA said. The firms ""unreasonably relied"" on financial advisors to waive the charges for retirement and eligible accounts for charities, without giving the advisers ""critical information and training,"" FINRA said.",2015-07-06,WFC,"Mon Jul 6, 2015 | 12:45pm EDT","Wells Fargo, LPL, Raymond James to reimburse $30 mln in fees - FINRA",http://www.reuters.com//article/finra-mutualfunds-fees-idUSL1N0ZM18S20150706?type=companyNews

Raymond James and LPL said in statements that they self-reported the problem to FINRA, which did not impose fines, given the firms' ""extraordinary cooperation.""The overcharges involve Class A shares, which have lower fees than Class B and C shares, but require an initial sales charge. Many mutual funds, however, waive the upfront sales for certain types of retirement accounts and charities.  Wells Fargo, Raymond James, and LPL had offered these waivers and disclosed them in their prospectuses, FINRA said. The case is similar to one FINRA brought last year against Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch unit, which resulted in the firm paying an $8 million fine. FINRA's Merrill case prompted some firms to review their practices to see whether they also had failed to provide the sales charge discounts that mutual fund issuers had made available to retirement accounts and charities, said Bradley Bennett, FINRA’s enforcement chief, in a June interview.The firms had self-reported their overcharges to FINRA, leading to an investigation, Bennett had said at the time without identifying the firms.Wells Fargo, Raymond James and LPL will pay affected customers an estimated $15 million, $8.7 million and $6.3 million, respectively.  The errors at the three companies have affected a total of more than 50,000 accounts at the firms since at least 2009, FINRA said. All three firms ""failed to adequately supervise"" the sale of mutual funds that offered sales charge waivers, FINRA said. The firms ""unreasonably relied"" on financial advisors to waive the charges for retirement and eligible accounts for charities, without giving the advisers ""critical information and training,"" FINRA said.

335,"   By Neha Dimri and Anil D'Silva  Wells Fargo & Co, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, reported a drop in profit for the second straight quarter as employee costs and other expenses rose at a time when it is struggling with slow revenue growth.Lower interest rates have crimped the bank's net income for the past two quarters, ending its five-year run of rising profits that was driven by a mortgage refinancing boom. Although Wells Fargo and other major U.S. banks have been making more loans, their net interest income growth has been sluggish due to low lending rates.Banks' net interest income has been under pressure also as lower-yielding loans replace higher-yielding assets.Wells Fargo's net interest income rose 4 percent in the second quarter ended June 30, a massive drop from the 97.5 percent growth it reported for the first quarter of 2009.The bank expects the acquisition of a $9 billion commercial loan portfolio from General Electric Co to add to its interest income in the current quarter, Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said on a conference call on Tuesday. Net interest margin, the difference between the rates at which the bank borrows and lends, fell to 2.97 percent from 3.15 percent a year earlier.Non-interest expenses rose 2.3 percent to $12.47 billion, accounting for about 58.5 percent of revenue, the higher end of its targeted range of 55-59 percent.Mortgage banking revenue, which accounted for 17 percent of its non-interest income, fell 1 percent. ""Mortgage banking was a little weaker than I had thought ... that was a little bit of a disappointment,"" Sandler O'Neill analyst R. Scott Siefers said.Wells Fargo made $62 billion of home loans in the quarter, up from $47 billion a year earlier and $49 billion in the first quarter.However, the bank expects to make lower mortgage loans in the third quarter as refinancing activity slows ahead of an expected rate hike by the Federal Reserve.  JPMorgan Chase & Co reported a stronger-than-expected rise in quarterly profit earlier on Tuesday as legal and restructuring expenses declined.Net income applicable to Wells Fargo's common shareholders fell to $5.36 billion from $5.42 billion.Total revenue rose about 1 percent to $21.30 billion.Wells Fargo's shares were up about 1 percent at $57.16 on the New York Stock Exchange.

336,"  NEW YORK Wells Fargo Corp's more than 15,000 brokers marched to their parent's cross-marketing drum beat in the second quarter, increasing sales of loans and money-management products to clients, the San Francisco-based bank said on Tuesday.The biggest U.S. mortgage lender, which like other banks urges brokers to sell lending and deposit products, said average loans among wealth and brokerage clients reached $59.3 billion during the quarter, up 16 percent from the comparable 2014 period. Credit quality remained strong despite the loan growth, allowing Wells to withdraw $10 million from its wealth management loss reserve.Managed account assets - in mutual funds, outside money managers and company investment models that brokers suggest for a fee to clients - grew 6 percent from a year earlier to $434 billion, primarily on new money collected as opposed to market gains. Banks and brokerage firms generally book more profit and more predictable results from fee-based accounts than from traditional commission-paying accounts.Overall, Wells Fargo's ""Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement"" sector, which also includes its private bank and its unit for administering corporate retirement plans and individual retirement accounts, reported an 11 percent gain in net income to a record $602 million from the April-June period of 2014.Revenue jumped 5 percent, or $189 million, on higher asset-based fees and interest income, while noninterest expense grew 3 percent, or $80 million, primarily because of higher litigation reserves as well as higher commission payments to brokers.  On a conference call with analysts, Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsbury said Wells is considering a service to compete with the growing crop of so-called robo-advisers that use algorithms to pick portfolios for clients who don't want advice. The company's brokerage force of 15,151 was unchanged from a year ago at the end of June.Staining the upbeat wealth management report was a 1 percent decline in client assets from this year's first quarter to $1.4 trillion among its brokerage units.

He said the city failed to identify any Wells Fargo policy to steer minorities into costly loans, and instead the city objected to the bank's issuance of federally-insured loans that can help lower-income borrowers afford homes, despite their higher costs.

345,"  (Adds details from decision, comments, case citation, byline)By Jonathan StempelJuly 17 Wells Fargo & Co on Friday won the dismissal of a lawsuit by Cook County, Illinois that accused the largest U.S. mortgage lender of violating the federal Fair Housing Act by engaging in predatory lending practices in the Chicago area.U.S. District Judge Gary Feinerman in Chicago said dismissal was appropriate because Cook County was outside the FHA's ""zone of interests,"" meaning that Congress did not authorize the county to bring claims under that law.Cook County, which includes Chicago, accused Wells Fargo of targeting tens of thousands of black, Hispanic and female borrowers through ""equity stripping,"" where it imposed excessive or unnecessary rates and fees as well as refinancing penalties.The county said this alleged misconduct boosted foreclosures, eroded property taxes, necessitated higher spending to combat blight, and caused at least $300 million of damages. Steering minorities into costly loans is sometimes called ""reverse redlining."" Chicago is the third most populous U.S. city.Feinerman said Cook County had constitutional standing to sue Wells Fargo, but could not pursue an FHA claim because it ""alleges neither that it was denied a loan nor offered unfavorable terms - setting aside the obvious point that Cook County is not alleged to have a race or other protected trait.""The judge added that his decision did not mean or suggest that Wells Fargo did not violate the FHA or engage in reverse redlining, ""or that the direct victims of Wells Fargo's alleged misconduct do not deserve compensation."" Feinerman said Cook County may file an amended complaint, but that he ""doubts"" that the problem can be fixed.Cook County and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Wells Fargo spokesman Ancel Martinez said: ""We are pleased with the court's decision and thoughtful analysis.""The San Francisco-based lender is also the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets.The lawsuit is similar to others that Cook County brought against Bank of America Corp and Britain's HSBC Holdings Plc.Several large U.S. cities and counties have accused major banks in lawsuits of biased mortgage lending that prolonged the nation's housing crisis. These lawsuits have had mixed success.The case is County of Cook, Illinois v. Wells Fargo & Co, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois, No. 14-09548.

351,"  (Adds details on investments, paragraph 18; adds second byline)By Jonathan Stempel and Jennifer AblanAug 7 Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc   said on Friday its second-quarter profit fell 37 percent, reflecting a significant decline in investment gains and an underwriting loss from insurance operations, which include Geico.Net income for the Omaha, Nebraska-based insurance and investment company fell to $4.01 billion, or $2,442 per Class A share, from $6.4 billion, or $3,889 per share, a year earlier.Operating profit dropped well below analysts' forecasts, declining 10 percent to $3.89 billion, or $2,367 per share, from $4.33 billion, or $2,634 per share, despite improvements at the BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy units.Analysts on average expected operating profit of about $3,038 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose 3 percent to $51.37 billion. Book value per share, Buffett's preferred measure of growth, rose 2 percent from the end of March to $149,735.Net investment and derivative gains plummeted 94 percent to $123 million from $2.06 billion a year earlier, when Berkshire shed its 40-year stake in former Washington Post publisher Graham Holdings Co.The most recent quarter included losses on contracts betting on long-term gains in major stock market indexes.Accounting rules require Berkshire to report investment and derivative gains and losses with earnings. Buffett considers the amounts in any given quarter irrelevant, and not reflective of Berkshire's business performance. GEICO WEAKENS Earnings from insurance, Berkshire's best-known operating sector, fell 39 percent to $939 million, and included a $38 million underwriting loss versus a year-earlier $411 million profit.Much of that weakness stemmed from the Geico car insurance unit. Its pretax underwriting gain fell 87 percent to $53 million, as it paid out more of the premiums it collected to cover losses from accidents. Berkshire is boosting premium rates as a result.Meanwhile, a Berkshire business that insures against major catastrophes suffered a $411 million pretax underwriting loss, reflecting currency fluctuations and a storm loss in Australia.Berkshire has been paring back in some insurance areas, particularly reinsurance, as new investors enter the industry, reducing the premiums that Berkshire can charge. ""Everyone is chasing the business,"" said Jeff Matthews, a principal at the hedge fund Ram Partners.""Outside of insurance,"" he added, ""things look fine.""KRAFT HEINZ Profit from BNSF rose 5 percent to $963 million as improved operating performance offset lower demand to ship petroleum products, reflecting lower crude oil prices, and fertilizer. Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a utility mostly owned by Berkshire, saw profit rise 34 percent to $502 million, helped by higher retail rates and a lower income tax rate.Berkshire has more than 80 operating businesses in such sectors as insurance, energy, food, industrial products and railroads.As of June 30 it also owned $117.7 billion of stocks such as Wells Fargo & Co and Coca-Cola Co. It bought $3.09 billion of equities in the quarter, without identifying the companies.The company estimated it will take a $7 billion non-cash pretax gain in the third quarter related to its 26.9 percent stake in Kraft Heinz Co.Berkshire took that stake in early July after backing the purchase of Kraft Foods Group Inc by H.J. Heinz Co, which Berkshire and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital acquired in 2013.The stake is worth about $25.5 billion, more than double what Buffett has said was Berkshire's $9.5 billion investment.Berkshire has the ability to make more big acquisitions, having ended the quarter with $66.59 billion of cash.The company also has dozens of smaller businesses that sell, among other things, Benjamin Moore paint, Borsheim's jewelry, Dairy Queen ice cream, Fruit of the Loom underwear, Johns Manville insulation and See's candies.On Friday, Berkshire Class A shares closed down $187.24 at $215,462.76, and its Class B shares rose 20 cents to $143.55. The shares are about 6 percent below their record highs set on Dec. 8.

352,"   By Mike Stone  Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) may divest its crop insurance business, one of the biggest in the United States, a spokeswoman told Reuters on Tuesday, as regulatory restrictions on U.S. banks force some to reconsider underwriting insurance policies.Wells Fargo has launched an auction for the business that could fetch more than $1 billion, people familiar with the matter said. When contacted by Reuters, Wells Fargo said it is reviewing strategic options for its Rural Community Insurance Services (RCIS) subsidiary that may include a sale, excluding the Wells Fargo Insurance Crop Agency, its brokerage arm.""Wells Fargo regularly evaluates the strengths and strategic fit for each of its businesses. As our model continues to evolve, we are more focused on increasing cross-sell and growing the distribution side of the insurance business,"" a Wells Fargo spokeswoman said in a statement.Bidders for RCIS could include reinsurers seeking exposure to the primary insurance market such as Bermuda-based PartnerRe Ltd PRE.N or Axis Capital Holdings Ltd (AXS.N), the sources said. Muenchener Rueckversicherungs Gesellschaft in Muenchen AG (MUVGn.DE) or Allianz SE (ALVG.DE) are also potential buyers, the sources said. Axis and PartnerRe declined to comment, MunichRe and Allianz did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Crop insurance helps farmers protect themselves from financial ruin when drought, disease, freezing temperatures, hail, or wind destroy their crops. About 90 percent of planted farmland is covered by insurance every year.A combination of low interest rates and extreme weather  such as flooding and drought have combined to make the business unattractive to many financial institutions and companies of late. OneBeacon Insurance Group Ltd (OB.N) and Monsanto Co (MON.N) are among those to have sold their crop insurance arms in recent months. Banks have been under increased pressure from U.S. regulators to strengthen their balance sheet and take on less risk, and this has also weighed on their ability to participate in the insurance business. Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), for example, sold its Global Atlantic Financial Group Ltd insurance unit in 2013.Wells Fargo now plans to be active in crop insurance through its insurance brokerage arm.   RCIS collects more than $2 billion in premiums annually from farmers. It has more than 4,000 licensed agents who can insure 137 types of crops.

Danoff has been increasing his position in bank stocks over the past year.""I believe the group offers an excellent risk-reward trade-off, particularly given the Fed's change in interest-rate policy,"" Danoff said in an interview Boston-based Fidelity Investments made available on Wednesday. ""I believe the market is underestimating the importance of the Fed's change in its interest-rate stance,"" Danoff said. ""If interest rates strengthen, I believe Wells Fargo's earnings could benefit materially and the stock could perform very well.""Danoff also expressed more optimism for Internet stocks and caution about the commodities sector. His remarks are closely followed on Wall Street, where he is considered one of the mutual fund industry's best stock pickers. Contrafund has produced an annualized total return of 7.51 percent over the past 15 years, or 3.16 percentage points better than the S&P 500 Index, according to Morningstar Inc. Danoff noted how falling interest rates have squeezed profit margins of U.S. banks have been squeezed over the past decade.The margin at Wells Fargo, a longtime holding for Contrafund, fell to 3.10 percent from 4.85 percent between 2004 and 2014, Danoff said. ""With the most recent data putting the unemployment rate at 5.3 percent, the U.S. economy does not need the stimulus of abnormally low rates,"" Danoff continued. ""If rates rise, price-to-earnings ratios may contract and the overall market may suffer modestly. But I believe certain sectors of the market could benefit from rising rates, most notably banks. Conversely, I think REITs and utilities likely will suffer.""Meanwhile, Danoff said he has grown more cautious about the commodities sector while becoming more optimistic about Internet stocks. He said he expects Google Inc, Facebook , Amazon.com Inc and Apple Inc to generate earnings per share faster than the average company in the next several years. His philosophy is that stock gains follow earnings growth.Contrafund's total return is 7.82 percent this year, easily beating the 2.48 percent total return on the S&P 500 Index.

Friday's filing suggests that only a small percentage of the $3.09 billion of stock that Berkshire bought in the quarter went to companies it already owned.Berkshire held 8.51 million shares of Charter worth $1.46 billion on June 30, up from 5.98 million shares on March 31.It also confirmed its purchase of 20 million shares, or 8.7 percent, of paint maker Axalta Coating Systems Ltd from controlling shareholder Carlyle Group LP. Berkshire reported lower stakes in conglomerate Chicago Bridge & Iron Co, media company Viacom Inc and Wabco Holdings Inc, which sells braking and suspension systems for commercial vehicles.It swapped most of what was once a much larger Phillips 66 stake for a chemicals business in February 2014.Friday's filing did not disclose who made which Berkshire investments. Smaller investments are often made by Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who may eventually succeed Buffett as chief investment officers. Combs invested in Precision Castparts before Berkshire said on Monday it would buy the aerospace parts maker. The transaction valued that company at $32.3 billion.Other prominent investors such as Jana Partners and Davis Selected advisers bought Precision Castparts during the quarter.Wells Fargo & Co remained Berkshire's biggest stock  holding.Kraft Heinz Co became Berkshire's second-biggest holding last month, when H.J. Heinz Co bought Kraft Foods Group Inc. That transformed Berkshire's 52.5 percent stake in Heinz into a 26.9 percent stake in Kraft Heinz.Berkshire owns more than 80 businesses, including the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream and Geico car insurance. Buffett, who turns 85 on Aug. 30 has run Berkshire for 50 years.

368,"   By Jonathan Stempel  A federal appeals court on Tuesday revived three lawsuits in which the City of Miami accused Wells Fargo & Co, Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc of predatory mortgage lending to black and Hispanic borrowers.By a 3-0 vote, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said a lower court erred in dismissing the city's claims under the federal Fair Housing Act, over what Miami called a decade of lending discrimination in its residential housing market.""It is clear that the harm the city claims to have suffered has a sufficiently close connection to the conduct thestatute prohibits,"" Circuit Judge Stanley Marcus wrote.U.S. cities including Baltimore, Chicago, Cleveland, Los Angeles and Memphis have with mixed success accused banks of biased mortgage lending that prolonged the nation's housing crisis.Miami alleged that Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Citigroup steered non-white borrowers into higher-cost loans they often could not afford, even if they had good credit. The city said this ""reverse redlining"" led to a large number of foreclosures, lower property tax collections and increased spending to combat urban blight.In July 2014, U.S. District Judge William Dimitrouleas in Fort Lauderdale, Florida dismissed Miami's lawsuits. He said the city lacked standing to sue, and that the alleged harm was too remote from the banks' conduct.But the appeals court said that standard was too stringent and that banks could have reasonably foreseen the ""attendant harm"" from their alleged discriminatory lending. The 11th Circuit did not rule on the merits. Wells Fargo is the largest U.S. mortgage lender and includes the former Wachovia, while Bank of America includes the former Countrywide Financial.Tom Goyda, a Wells Fargo spokesman, said the San Francisco-based bank is disappointed in the outcome and ""prepared to present strong arguments in support of our long history of fair and responsible lending in Miami and across the country.""Bank of America spokesman Rick Simon said the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank is considering its options. ""Our record demonstrates a firm commitment and strong record for fair and responsible lending and community revitalization,"" he said. Mark Rodgers, a spokesman for New York-based Citigroup, declined to comment.The Miami city attorney's office had no immediate comment.In July, federal judges in Chicago and Los Angeles dismissed lawsuit accusing Wells Fargo of predatory lending in those cities. Los Angeles' similar lawsuit against Bank of America was dismissed in May.The cases in the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals are Miami v. Bank of America Corp et al, No. 14-14543; Miami v.

371,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A former Wells Fargo & Co trader on Monday was cleared of insider trading charges brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission after a major appellate decision limited authorities' ability to pursue such cases.Following a trial before the regulator's in-house court, Administrative Law Judge Jason Patil dismissed the charges against Joseph Ruggieri, who the SEC said made over $117,000 for Wells Fargo trading on tips by one of the bank's analysts.Patil said while the SEC established that Ruggieri traded on the tips four times, it failed to prove the analyst, Gregory Bolan, received anything in exchange for the information as required by the December appellate ruling.Paul Ryan, Ruggieri's lawyer, said the ""decision makes clear what we have said from the beginning: Joseph Ruggieri did not commit insider trading.""The SEC declined to comment.The SEC alleged that Ruggieri, a healthcare stock trader at Wells Fargo in New York, in 2010 and 2011 traded on tips about six ratings changes made by Bolan for companies that included Athenahealth Inc and Bruker Corp. The SEC brought charges in September 2014. Bolan agreed to settle for $75,000 while neither admitting nor denying the charges.Ruggieri, who denied the charges, became the first defendant to face trial after a Dec. 10 ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York that authorities say narrowed what constitutes insider trading.The 2nd Circuit, in reversing the convictions of hedge fund managers Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson, held that authorities must prove a trader knew a tip's source received something in exchange. The court also narrowly defined what constituted a benefit to the tipper, saying it had to be of ""some consequence"" and could not be just be a friendship.In his decision on Monday, Patil cited the 2nd Circuit's ruling in concluding that the SEC failed to prove Bolan received anything in exchange for his tips.The SEC contended that Bolan tipped Ruggieri in exchange for positive feedback that could factor into bonus and promotion decisions and in order to maintain their friendship. But Patil said it was ""more plausible that Ruggieri's feedback was genuine"" and that Bolan did not seek it as an illicit benefit. Their friendship ""was not a meaningful, close, or personal one,"" Patil said.The SEC can appeal. The U.S. Justice Department has asked the Supreme Court to review the 2nd Circuit's decision.The case is In the Matter of Bolan and Ruggieri, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Administrative Proceeding No. 3-16178.

375,"   By Dena Aubin | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The City of Oakland, California has sued Wells Fargo & Co, accusing the largest U.S. mortgage lender of steering minorities into high-cost mortgage loans that allegedly led to foreclosures, abandoned properties and neighborhood blight.The complaint is a sign that U.S. municipalities are not relenting in a push to hold big banks liable for economic damages following the 2007 foreclosure crisis.Similar lawsuits accusing banks of mortgage discrimination have been dismissed, though a federal appeals court in Florida recently gave three major cases new life by affirming cities' right to sue under the U.S. Fair Housing Act (FHA).Filed on Monday in a Northern California federal court, the complaint against Wells seeks punitive damages for alleged FHA violations, accusing the bank of ""putting its financial interests ahead of its customers and the City of Oakland in order to maximize profits.""Wells Fargo spokesman Tom Goyda said the accusations ""do not reflect how we operate in the communities where we do business."" The bank will vigorously defend its record as a fair and responsible lender, he said. Oakland's lawsuit accuses Wells of targeting minorities for high-cost loans even if they qualified for more affordable loans. The lawsuit said many of the loans ended in foreclosure because Wells refused to refinance them on the same terms it granted to white borrowers. The lawsuit also accuses Wells of violating the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, which bars discrimination in housing practices on the basis of race.The lawsuit said Wells steered minorities into various types of ""predatory loans,"" including those with high interest rates, balloon payments and large prepayment penalties. African-American borrowers in Oakland were 2.4 times more likely to receive a predatory loan than comparable white borrowers, the lawsuit said. Hispanic borrowers were 2.5 times more likely to receive a predatory loan, the lawsuit said.Loans in minority neighborhoods were 4.75 times more likely to end in foreclosure, the lawsuit said.The disproportionate number of foreclosures among minorities would not have happened if the bank applied uniform lending practices, the lawsuit said.  A similar lawsuit filed by the City of Los Angeles was dismissed in July by U.S. District Judge Otis Wright, who said Wells issued only 27 high-cost loans to minorities during the period covered by the lawsuit, and no evidence was offered that any of them resulted in foreclosure.

377,"   By Dena Aubin | NEW YORK, Sept 22  NEW YORK, Sept 22 The City of Oakland, California has sued Wells Fargo & Co, accusing the largest U.S. mortgage lender of steering minorities into high-cost mortgage loans that allegedly led to foreclosures, abandoned properties and neighborhood blight.The complaint is a sign that U.S. municipalities are not relenting in a push to hold big banks liable for economic damages following the 2007 foreclosure crisis.Similar lawsuits accusing banks of mortgage discrimination have been dismissed, though a federal appeals court in Florida recently gave three major cases new life by affirming cities' right to sue under the U.S. Fair Housing Act (FHA).Filed on Monday in a Northern California federal court, the complaint against Wells seeks punitive damages for alleged FHA violations, accusing the bank of ""putting its financial interests ahead of its customers and the City of Oakland in order to maximize profits.""Wells Fargo spokesman Tom Goyda said the accusations ""do not reflect how we operate in the communities where we do business."" The bank will vigorously defend its record as a fair and responsible lender, he said. Oakland's lawsuit accuses Wells of targeting minorities for high-cost loans even if they qualified for more affordable loans. The lawsuit said many of the loans ended in foreclosure because Wells refused to refinance them on the same terms it granted to white borrowers.The lawsuit also accuses Wells of violating the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, which bars discrimination in housing practices on the basis of race.

379,"  Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) has the largest exposure to loans to energy companies among major U.S. lenders, a report from Raymond James said, amid concerns that banks may have to set aside more money to cover bad loans to the industry.The bank also topped the list with the biggest exposure to energy companies whose public debt was trading less than 35 percent of par, the brokerage said on Thursday.Wells Fargo was followed by Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N), Comerica Inc (CMA.N) and BB&T Corp (BBT.N). Companies whose debt is trading 35 percent below par are generally seen as more distressed in comparison to those trading at 70-75 percent below par. U.S. accounting rules require that banks set aside money to cover losses on loans after the loan shows visible signs of deterioration. Oil has seen big price swings since the end of August on a mixed supply-demand outlook from the EIA, the International Energy Agency and producer group OPEC.  Brent crude LCOc1 was marginally up at $48.04 per barrel on Thursday. Prices are down about 59 percent since peaking in June last year.Wells Fargo CFO John Shrewsberry said in July that he expected energy-related credit performance will remain weak.Energy exposure accounts for just 2 percent of Wells Fargo's loan portfolio. By the same measure, MidSouth Bancorp Inc (MSL.N) topped the list with about 20 percent of its total loans to energy companies, according to the Raymond James report.BOK Financial Corp (BOKF.O), Cullen/Frost Bankers Inc (CFR.N) and Hancock Holding Co (HBHC.O) were among the top four. With oil prices expected to remain lower for longer and slowdown in capital markets activity and bankruptcies in the E&P space, the brokerage said it remained cautious near term.""We continue to believe that even though the energy lenders have underperformed in sympathy with crude, it is still too early to buy the dip,"" Raymond James said.

380,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Wells Fargo & Company's  (WFC) ratings at 'AA-/F1+' and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.'s ratings at 'AA/F1+'. The  Rating Outlook remains Stable. The affirmation reflects the company's superior  earnings profile, solid and consistent management team, and strength of its  franchise across many business lines.  The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One Finance Corporation (COF),  Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares  Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holding  Corporation (MUAH), PNC Financial Services Group (PNC), Regions Financial  Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI), US Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo &  Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRs, VRs, AND SENIOR DEBT The affirmation reflects the company's superior earnings profile, solid and  consistent management team, and strength of its franchise across many business  lines.  Over the past several years, WFC's financial performance has been very strong  despite a challenging economic and interest rate environment. WFC continues to  post solid levels of net income, with return on assets (ROAs) well in excess of  the large regional average. WFC's superior earnings performance is a core  strength for the company, and a positive rating driver that differentiates it  from its peers. Fitch attributes WFC's superior earnings profile to its proven cross-sell  strategy, low funding costs, efficient cost structure, and a diversified  business model by geography and product type that has proven resilient over  time. Further, Fitch assumes that WFC has been able to benefit post-financial  crisis from a flight to quality.  WFC continues to report very strong levels of net income, in spite of  considerable margin compression over the past couple of years, more so than  other large regional peers. Somewhat explaining this, WFC has reported the  highest level of deposit growth, which has left the company with an excess  amount of liquidity, only to be reinvested into lower yielding assets. This  excess cash represents a significant resource available for the company to  invest into earning assets as rates rise.  Fitch views WFC's deposit franchise as currently undervalued in this low-rate  environment. As deposit rates have fallen from pre-crisis levels, the benefit to  WFC from its low cost of funding has compressed. The differential in funding  costs has narrowed as all the large regional banks have all been able to  continually lower deposit costs. When interest rates rise, WFC will likely be  able to maintain lower funding costs relative to peers, helping to maintain  superior profitability metrics in a higher interest rate environment.  WFC's management team is also viewed very favorably by Fitch. There has been a  great deal of stability in the executive management ranks, with little turnover.  Fitch views this as a competitive strength as the company's strategic direction  and corporate culture remains consistent, and less vulnerable to swings in  strategy. WFC's stated strategic objectives are clearly articulated, and  achievable. Even during a challenging interest rate environment, the company is  able to easily meet its three financial targets for ROA, return on equity (ROE)  and the efficiency ratio, which are 1.3% to 1.6%, 12% to 15%, and 55% to 59%,  respectively.  Fitch views no company as immune to operational issues or losses, though WFC has  emerged relatively unscathed from the financial crisis, especially relative to  similarly sized peers. Fitch attributes WFC's greater immunity to risk  management failures and lack of outsized legal charges that have plagued the  bigger banks to its long-tenured senior management team and strong corporate  risk culture.  WFC's franchise is considered the strongest of the large regional banks, with  leading market shares in many sectors and asset classes. WFC has the second most  deposits in the U.S., and is a leading lender in many products, including  mortgage origination and servicing, small business, commercial real estate,  automobile, and middle-market commercial & industrial (C&I). WFC is also the  second largest debit card issuer, second largest private student lender, third  largest full-service retail brokerage (based on financial advisors), and fourth  largest wealth management provider (based on AUM). This franchise provides the  company with economies of scale that are difficult to replicate, and allows the  company to effectively compete with any bank given the breadth of its product  offerings.  In terms of WFC's financial profile, asset quality continues to improve, while  capital and liquidity remain good. WFC's credit risk metrics have improved  alongside the industry. WFC's nonperforming asset (NPA) ratios remain elevated  and above regional bank peer averages. Much of the weaker relative performance  is due to a large balance of mortgage-related accruing troubled debt  restructurings (TDRs). Despite higher NPA levels, NCOs are roughly in line with  peer averages. Fitch expects loan losses will increase from currently  unsustainably low levels for WFC, as well as the industry, especially under a  higher interest rate environment. However, higher provisioning should not  materially impact WFC's financial profile given its earnings strength.  Although WFC is one of the largest participants in the energy-sector, overall  O&G loans represent less than 2% of total loans. WFC indicated that its loan  loss reserves incorporate potential losses on WFC's oil and gas exposures.  WFC's capital profile is considered solid, relative to its risk profile, capital  generation capabilities, and target payout ranges. The Common Equity Tier 1  under Basel III Advanced Approach, fully phased-in, was 10.55% at June 30, 2015,  well above the fully phased-in requirement of 9%, which includes the recently  announced 2% G-SIB capital surcharge.  Fitch expects that WFC will maintain a capital cushion over the 9% requirement  to insulate the company from volatility in unrealized losses and the valuation  of the MSR asset. There is also uncertainty with regard to the inclusion of the  capital surcharge in CCAR stress testing. As such, Fitch believes that WFC will  likely carry a higher level of capital than some of its large regional peers  over the long term, who do not have a G-SIB surcharge.   In terms of the finalized U.S. Basel III supplemental leverage ratio (SLR) rule  issued on April 8, 2014, WFC easily meets the holding company requirement with  an estimated fully phased-in SLR of 7.8% at June 30, 2015. Fitch expects that  WFC will be able to meet a long-term debt requirement when the regulatory rules  are announced; however, the requirement to maintain a higher level of debt than  its business model needs may modestly impact profitability and could lead to  incremental risk taking.  WFC is primarily deposit funded, with core deposits representing 75% of total  funding sources as of June 30, 2015. WFC also actively uses wholesale funding  sources, including short- and long-term debt. Debt maturities are well  distributed, and significant liquidity is held in the form of cash and liquid  assets at both the parent company and the banks. Furthermore, there is a limited  reliance on short-term borrowings, with federal funds purchased, securities sold  under agreements to repurchase, commercial paper, trading liabilities, and other  short-term borrowings, at approximately 9% of total funding as of June 30, 2015,  well below similarly-sized banks, though higher than the large regional peer  average.  The parent's liquidity is considered solid, as the firm strives to maintain its  parent liquidity position such that it has the ability to stay out of the  wholesale markets for a minimum of 12 months at any given point in time. WFC's  high credit ratings have helped it gain universal acceptance in virtually all  global capital markets on very favorable terms, and Fitch anticipates that WFC  will continue to be able to easily issue debt to meet upcoming debt maturities  and other requirements.   SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES WFC's subordinated debt is notched one level below its VR of 'aa-' for loss  severity. WFC's preferred stock is notched five levels below its VR, two times  for loss severity and three times for non-performance, while WFC's trust  preferred securities are notched two times from the VR for loss severity and two  times for non-performance. These ratings are in accordance with Fitch's criteria  and assessment of the instruments non-performance and loss severity risk  profiles and have thus been affirmed due to the affirmation of the VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The uninsured deposit ratings of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank  Northwest are rated one notch higher than Wells Fargo Bank's IDR and senior  unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from depositor  preference.  U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities superior  recovery prospects in the event of default.  WFC's international subsidiary, Wells Fargo Bank International's deposit ratings  are at the same level as senior debt ratings because their preferential status  is less clear and disclosure concerning dually payable deposits makes it  difficult to determine if they are eligible for U.S. depositor preference. HOLDING COMPANY  WFC's VR is equalized with those of its operating companies and banks,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. VRs are also equalized  reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and subsidiary  failure and default probabilities.  SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY Fitch upgraded the IDRs of Wells Fargo Bank N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank Northwest  N.A. to 'AA' in May 2015, The Rating Outlooks are Stable. The upgrade of the  banks' ratings to a notch above the parent reflects the expected implementation  of total loss absorbing capital (TLAC) requirements for U.S. Global Systemically  Important Banks (G-SIBs) and the presence of a substantial debt buffer in the  holding company. The VRs remain equalized between WFC and its material operating subsidiaries.  The common VR of WFC and its operating companies reflects the correlated  performance, or failure rate between the WFC and these subsidiaries. Fitch takes  a group view on the credit profile from a failure perspective, while the IDR  reflects each entity's non-performance (default) risk on senior debt. Fitch  believes that the likelihood of failure is roughly equivalent, while the default  risk given at the operating company would be lower given TLAC. All U.S. bank  subsidiaries carry a common VR, regardless of size, as U.S. banks are  cross-guaranteed under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and  Enforcement Act (FIRREA).  Wells Fargo Canada Corp., Wells Fargo Bank International, and Wells Fargo  Securities International Limited are wholly owned subsidiaries of WFC or Wells  Fargo Bank, N.A.  Their IDRs and debt ratings are aligned with WFC reflecting  Fitch's view that these entities are core and integral to WFC's business  strategy and operations. Their IDRs and ratings would be sensitive to the same  factors that might drive a change in WFC's IDR. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR WFC has a Support Rating (SR) of '5' and Support Rating Floor (SRF) of 'NF'. In  Fitch's view, the probability of support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not  incorporate any support.   In May of this year, Fitch downgraded the SR and SRF for Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.  and Wells Fargo Bank Northwest in line with Fitch's view of sovereign support.   The SR and SRF reflect Fitch's view that senior creditors can no longer rely on  receiving full extraordinary support from the sovereign in the event that WFC  becomes non-viable. Also, implementation of the Dodd Frank Orderly Liquidation  Authority legislation is now sufficiently progressed to provide a framework for  resolving banks that are likely to require holding company senior creditors  participating in losses, if necessary, instead of or ahead of the company  receiving sovereign support. Wells Fargo Bank International has a support rating of '1', which is an  institutional support rating, and indicates that there is a high probability  that WFC would provide support to Wells Fargo Bank International, which is  domiciled in Ireland.   RATING SENSITIVITIES VR, IDRs, AND SENIOR DEBT Given that WFC's ratings are already at the top of the globally rated bank  universe, Fitch views limited potential for an upgrade.  Conversely, failure to maintain earnings at above peer levels will pressure  WFC's ratings, as its earning profile is one of the key rating drivers. The  strength of the earnings stream provides for solid capital generation  capabilities, which will help absorb unexpected losses.  Market-sensitive revenues, which include gains and losses on equity investments,  trading activities, and debt securities, combined with investment banking fees,  have averaged around 6.5% of total revenues for WFC over the past year. Fitch  expects that capital markets-related revenues will remain relatively modest in  the context of overall earnings; however, an outsized reliance could impact  ratings given the general volatility and risks associated with capital markets  revenues.  WFC's ratings may also be sensitive to any outsized risks that company may take  as it relates to a higher implied cost of capital given the company's G-SIB  capital surcharge. However, given the bank has a superior earnings profile and a  strong risk culture, Fitch views this risk as low likelihood. To date, litigation-related costs have been very manageable. While WFC does not  disclose actual litigation reserves (similar to many of its peers), the high end  of the range of reasonably possible potential litigation losses in excess of the  company's liability for probable and estimable losses was $1.4 billion at June  30, 2015, considered very modest in the context of annual pretax pre-provision  revenues of roughly $35 billion. Fitch anticipates that any FHA-related fine  that may ultimately get assessed will be manageable in the context of WFC's  superior earnings profile, and that WFC will comply with the outstanding items  from the mortgage servicing amended Consent Order. However, any material  outsized legal, regulatory or operational-related charges may adversely impact  ratings.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings for WFC and its operating companies' subordinated debt, trust  preferred securities, and preferred stock are sensitive to any change to WFC's  VR.     LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The long-and short-term deposit ratings are sensitive to any change to WFC's  long- and short-term IDR.   HOLDING COMPANY  Should WFC's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies.  SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY   Given that WFC's and the banks' VRs remain equalized, Wells Fargo Bank N.A.'s  ratings are broadly sensitive to the same considerations that might affect WFC's  VR.  The IDRs and ratings of Wells Fargo Canada Corp., Wells Fargo Bank  International, and Wells Fargo Securities International Limited are sensitive to  the same factors that might drive a change in WFC's IDR. Wells Fargo Securities International Limited's Rating Outlook is Positive. The  Positive Outlook reflects the agency's belief that the internal TLAC of material  international operating companies will likely be large enough to meet Pillar 1  capital requirements and will then be sufficient to recapitalize them. A  one-notch upgrade is likely once Fitch has sufficient clarity on additional  disclosure on the pre-positioning of internal TLAC and its sufficiency in size  to cover a default of senior operating company liabilities. Sufficient clarity  may, however, take longer to come through than the typical Outlook horizon of  one to two years.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Since WFC's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively,  there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable  future.  Additionally, due to the linkage in ratings between WFC and Wells Fargo Bank  International, if Wells Fargo Bank International were to become less  strategically important to WFC, its ratings may be impacted.

383,"  General Electric Co (GE.N) took a big step on Tuesday in its plan to unload most of its financing operations, saying it has agreed to sell commercial lending and leasing businesses worth more than $30 billion to Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N).The U.S. conglomerate has now inked $126 billion in transactions -- more than half of its overall target -- since announcing in April it would seek to reduce its GE Capital financing business to less than 10 percent of earnings as it focuses more on industrial manufacturing. GE Capital accounted for 42 percent of the company's profit in 2014.Only one remaining significant GE Capital business in the United States remains: its franchise finance unit, which has about $5.5 billion worth of assets. The ability to move fast on its U.S. transactions is critical because once those deals close, GE plans to apply to  shed GE Capital's regulatory designation as a Systemically Important Financial Institution, or SIFI, a label it gained after the 2008 financial crisis.The sale to Wells, the price of which was not disclosed,  involves three lines of business: commercial distribution finance, vendor finance and corporate finance.  Commercial distribution finance offers lending to dealers and manufacturers of durable goods, such as boats, recreational vehicles and off-road vehicles. Vendor finance involves dealer networks for commercial equipment such as copiers, materials handling and construction machines.Corporate finance includes asset-based loans and equipment leasing to a range of mid-size and larger companies. About 3,000 GE employees of the 3,500 in those businesses will shift to Wells through the deal, GE said.The transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2016, GE said. Reuters first reported last week that GE was nearing a deal to sell the massive portfolio of loans to Wells.Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse advised GE on the deal.

385,"   By Richa Naidu and Rachel Chitra  Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), the biggest U.S. residential mortgage lender, reported a rise in quarterly profit for the first time in three quarters on Wednesday, helped by its purchase of commercial loans from General Electric Co (GE.N).The San Francisco lender has been using its hefty balance sheet to diversify its business as it braces for a rise in interest rates to cut into demand for home loans.It is unclear when the U.S. Federal Reserve will hike interest rates, but Fed Chair Janet Yellen recently said she supports raising rates this year.Some analysts also believe the housing market is at or near a peak, while the U.S Federal Reserve has created further uncertainty by indicating it will soon raise interest rates.Wells Fargo, whose shares were down 0.5 percent in early trading, agreed earlier this year to buy a portion of GE's commercial real estate loans worth $9 billion.That acquisition helped to drive up net interest income, a measure of the interest received from loans after paying for funding and accounting for potential loan losses, by 1.7 percent to $10.75 billion.In its latest deal, the bank said on Tuesday it would buy a portfolio of commercial loans and leases worth more than $30 billion from GE for an undisclosed amount. Nomura analysts said the deal could add 3-4 percent to earnings per share in 2016.Given that Wells Fargo is buying assets in businesses where it already has a presence, the incremental costs from these acquisitions are quite manageable, Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg wrote in a note on Tuesday.EARNINGS BEAT - JUST  Wells Fargo, the No. 4 U.S. bank by assets, said its net income applicable to common shareholders rose 0.65 percent to $5.44 billion, or $1.05 per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30 from $5.41 billion, or $1.02 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.04 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.""There appeared to be no major special items, and results seem to reflect clean operating earnings,"" Oppenheimer & Co analyst Chris Kotowski wrote in a note.Mortgage banking revenue fell 2.7 percent to $1.59 billion, accounting for about 15 percent of non-interest income.

386,"   By Dan Freed  George Morris, a web consultant from Boulder, Colorado, has been a Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC.N) banking customer for nearly 15 years, but when he needed a new credit card recently he picked Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N).Morris said he was put off by what he called a ""rat's nest"" of offerings on Wells Fargo's website.Consumers like Morris are a problem for Wells, which is far behind rivals in building up its credit card business. The bank said on Wednesday that it had just $32.3 billion in credit loans outstanding at the end of September, representing less than 4 percent of its total loans.At JPMorgan (JPM.N), in contrast, credit cards represented 16 percent of loans at the end of September, and at Bank of America Corp, (BAC.N) they were 10 percent. Wells Fargo hopes to boost its business to improve its profitability - it may double the loans it has on its books in the coming years, Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry told Reuters. But to achieve its growth goals, Wells Fargo will have to be a little less like its usual self, Shrewsberry said. The fourth largest U.S. bank has long prided itself on selling more products to its customers than any of its rivals, a business practice known as ""cross selling"" that few lenders can do successfully. The bank's skill in cross selling has made it one of the most profitable of the major U.S. banks, and the most valuable in terms of market valuation in the world.But cross selling won't help Wells Fargo build up its credit card business from here, because it already has sold cards to so many of its customers: 43 percent of its 70 million customers have Wells Fargo cards. Getting much higher than that - winning customers like George Morris, for example, will not be easy.The bank instead plans to target new customers, which is risky because it knows less about them than those who, for example, have their paychecks directly deposited in their Wells Fargo checking account.Credit card loans can bring big headaches to banks because they are not usually collateralized and can head south fast when the economy slows down. Bank of America saw that first hand when it bought MBNA Corp in 2006 and ramped up its credit card portfolio by 24 percent by the end of 2008. By the end of 2009, it had to set aside more than $25 billion to cover loan losses. ""We'll take - as we have been - a very slow approach so we can get it right from a risk perspective,"" Shrewsberry said.Like most banks, Wells Fargo is struggling to increase profits during a long period of low interest rates, which has reduced the profitability of lending. The bank said its lending margins fell 0.1 percentage point to 2.96 percent in the third quarter.Credit card loans can be among the most profitable consumer loans. Citigroup (C.N), for example, earns a 3 percent return on the credit card loans it makes, three times the average for the entire bank, according to estimates from Bernstein Research. As the U.S. economy recovers, defaults have been low and banks can still charge high rates for these loans. But while growing the business is not easy, Wells Fargo has been doing so. The bank on Wednesday said that in the third quarter its credit card loan book grew by 4 percent from the second quarter. If the bank can maintain that pace, the business could double in under five years.Wells has shown a willingness to test strategies that other banks have shied away from, such as offering mortgage customers the ability to apply credit card rebates to pay down home loans.  It has tried issuing American Express cards. The bank was also said to be especially aggressive in bidding on a partnership with department store chain Dillard's Inc (DDS.N), according to an analyst. Wells eventually won the deal.The bank recognizes that the current low level of defaults will not last forever, but believes that future losses will not overwhelm profit on the loans it is making now.""We wouldn't be pursuing it if we didn't feel that through-the-cycle returns made sense,"" Shrewsberry said.

388,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 14 (Fitch) Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) reported $5.8 billion  in net income for a return on assets (ROA) of 1.32%, up $77 million from last  quarter. Earnings were supported by both spread income and non-interest income  growth, as well as controlled expenses. This was partially offset by an increase  in provision expenses, though at only 31 basis points (bps) of average loans,  provisioning still remains below historical averages for the company.  Fitch  Ratings views these results as in line with expectations for WFC, one of the  strongest and most consistent earnings profiles in the industry. WFC also announced an agreement to acquire GE's commercial distribution finance  and vendor finance businesses, as well as certain corporate finance loan and  leases, with assets totaling $32 billion or roughly 3.5% of WFC's total loans.  The loan and lease portfolios are predominantly U.S. and Canada-based, and the  transaction is expected to close in 1Q16.  While the terms of the deal were not disclosed, Fitch views this transaction as  a complement to WFC's existing Equipment Finance and Capital Finance divisions.  WFC also recently announced acquisitions of GE's railcar and locomotive-leasing  units, and previously purchased a portfolio of CRE loans. Operating from a  position of strength, WFC has been able to benefit by taking advantage of these  opportunities, while some of its similarly sized peers have needed to de-lever  since the financial crisis.    Spread income increased almost 2% on a linked-quarter basis, primarily supported  by growth in loans and securities, as well as one additional day in the quarter.  Core loan growth was 2% on a linked-quarter basis, while securities balances  grew 1.3%. The net interest margin was fairly flat during the quarter, falling  1bp in 3Q15 to 2.96%.  Non-interest income was higher during the quarter due to growth in  market-sensitive revenues, deposit service charges, and card fees. This was  partially offset by lower mortgage banking, insurance and trust and investment  fees. Linked-quarter and prior-year comparisons also reflected a significant  increase in Other income driven by the accounting impact of lower interest rates  related to hedges on WFC's own issued debt, higher income on investments  accounted for under the equity method, and the gain on sale of the Warranty  Solutions business.  Market-sensitive revenues, which include gains and losses on equity investments,  trading activities, and debt securities, increased a substantial 25% on a  linked-quarter basis due to very strong equity gains. WFC indicated that the  gains were from a number of venture capital, private equity, and other  investments. These market-sensitive revenues, combined with investment banking  fees, were around 6% of total revenues, and can be volatile from quarter to  quarter. Mortgage banking revenues fell 7% on a sequential basis, expected given ending  application and pipeline balances at the prior quarter-end. Revenues declined as  lower origination income was only partially offset by stronger net servicing  income. Expenses were fairly flat on a sequential basis, primarily due to lower employee  benefit expenses, which were partially offset by higher salaries reflecting the  one additional day in the quarter. Operating losses remained stable, but include  still elevated litigation accruals. WFC expects to operate at the higher end of  its targeted 55% to 59% efficiency ratio for the full year 2015. The company's  efficiency ratio was 56.7% in 3Q15, improving from the prior quarter.  For the first time in over five years, WFC reported the absence of a reserve  release with provision expenses equaling net charge-offs (NCOs). WFC attributed  no reserve release to continued improvement in residential real estate, offset  by deterioration in the energy sector. Overall O&G loans represent less than 2%  of total loans. WFC is in the process of the fall borrowing base-redetermination  process, with reserve-based loans performing as expected. WFC's exposure to  oilfield services is under more pressure, while WFC is also closely monitoring  MSAs whose economies are more closely tied to oil production.  Total loan losses ticked up 1bp to a still low 31bps during the quarter due to  seasonally higher auto losses. Non-accrual balances fell 7% on a linked-quarter  basis reflecting improvement in both consumer and commercial loan categories.  WFC continued to extend the duration of its balance sheet this quarter, albeit  at a slower pace than last quarter, as it prepares for the medium- and long-end  of the curve to remain lower for an extended period of time, irrespective of  changes on the short-end. WFC remains asset sensitive, and expects to grow  spread income over the long-term even if the rate environment remains  challenging.  The estimated Common Equity Tier 1 under Basel III,, fully phased-in, increased  roughly 12bps to 10.7% at quarter-end. WFC began using the Advanced Approach,  following regulatory approval last quarter.

393,"   By Dan Freed   (In Oct. 14 story, corrects to reflect that 43 percent of retail banking households, not of all Wells Fargo customers, have credit cards from the bank, paragraph 8)By Dan FreedGeorge Morris, a web consultant from Boulder, Colorado, has been a Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC.N) banking customer for nearly 15 years, but when he needed a new credit card recently he picked Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N).Morris said he was put off by what he called a ""rat's nest"" of offerings on Wells Fargo's website.Consumers like Morris are a problem for Wells, which is far behind rivals in building up its credit card business. The bank said on Wednesday that it had just $32.3 billion in credit loans outstanding at the end of September, representing less than 4 percent of its total loans.At JPMorgan (JPM.N), in contrast, credit cards represented 16 percent of loans at the end of September, and at Bank of America Corp, (BAC.N) they were 10 percent. Wells Fargo hopes to boost its business to improve its profitability - it may double the loans it has on its books in the coming years, Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry told Reuters. But to achieve its growth goals, Wells Fargo will have to be a little less like its usual self, Shrewsberry said. The fourth largest U.S. bank has long prided itself on selling more products to its customers than any of its rivals, a business practice known as ""cross selling"" that few lenders can do successfully. The bank's skill in cross selling has made it one of the most profitable of the major U.S. banks, and the most valuable in terms of market valuation in the world.But cross selling won't help Wells Fargo build up its credit card business from here, because it already has sold cards to so many of its customers: 43 percent of the more than 22 million households that are Wells Fargo retail banking customers have credit cards from the bank. Getting much higher than that - winning customers like George Morris, for example, will not be easy.The bank instead plans to target new customers, which is risky because it knows less about them than those who, for example, have their paychecks directly deposited in their Wells Fargo checking account. Credit card loans can bring big headaches to banks because they are not usually collateralized and can head south fast when the economy slows down. Bank of America saw that first hand when it bought MBNA Corp in 2006 and ramped up its credit card portfolio by 24 percent by the end of 2008. By the end of 2009, it had to set aside more than $25 billion to cover loan losses.""We'll take - as we have been - a very slow approach so we can get it right from a risk perspective,"" Shrewsberry said.Like most banks, Wells Fargo is struggling to increase profits during a long period of low interest rates, which has reduced the profitability of lending. The bank said its lending margins fell 0.1 percentage point to 2.96 percent in the third quarter.Credit card loans can be among the most profitable consumer loans. Citigroup (C.N), for example, earns a 3 percent return on the credit card loans it makes, three times the average for the entire bank, according to estimates from Bernstein Research. As the U.S. economy recovers, defaults have been low and banks can still charge high rates for these loans. But while growing the business is not easy, Wells Fargo has been doing so. The bank on Wednesday said that in the third quarter its credit card loan book grew by 4 percent from the second quarter. If the bank can maintain that pace, the business could double in under five years.Wells has shown a willingness to test strategies that other banks have shied away from, such as offering mortgage customers the ability to apply credit card rebates to pay down home loans.  It has tried issuing American Express cards. The bank was also said to be especially aggressive in bidding on a partnership with department store chain Dillard's Inc (DDS.N), according to an analyst. Wells eventually won the deal.The bank recognizes that the current low level of defaults will not last forever, but believes that future losses will not overwhelm profit on the loans it is making now.""We wouldn't be pursuing it if we didn't feel that through-the-cycle returns made sense,"" Shrewsberry said.

407,"  (New throughout, specifies long term debt, mentions vote, adds comments from Fed staff and deadlines)By Dan FreedOct 30 Six big U.S. banks need to raise an additional $120 billion, most likely in long-term debt, under a rule proposed on Friday by the Federal Reserve.The requirements are aimed at ensuring that some of the biggest and most interconnected banks, which include Goldman Sachs Group Inc,, JPMorgan Chase & Co,, and Wells Fargo & Co, can better withstand another crisis by turning some of their debt, particularly debt issued by their holding companies, into equity without disrupting markets or requiring a government bailout.The banks are expected to meet the $120 billion shortfall by issuing debt, which is usually more cost-effective than issuing equity, according to Federal Reserve officials speaking at a background press briefing Friday. The rule proposed Friday, largely in line with banks' expectations, concerns the lenders' total loss-absorbing capacity.It is one of a series of rules aimed at reducing risk in the banking system by determining how much debt and equity banks should use to fund themselves. In a procedural vote, the Fed's governors approved a draft of the proposal, meaning it will be submitted for public comment.During a public meeting with Fed officials, one staffer who worked on the rule said banks should have an easy time complying, because many requirements overlapped with existing rules. Further, the bulk of the debt requirements can be fulfilled by refinancing existing debt, the staffer said. Some requirements must be met by Jan. 1, 2019, while more-stringent requirements must be met by Jan. 1, 2022.The requirements are most stringent for JPMorgan, followed by Citigroup Inc. After that come Bank of America Corp,  Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, all of which have the same requirement. Wells Fargo & Co's  requirement is the next highest, followed by State Street Corp  and finally Bank of New York Mellon Corp.JPMorgan has more than $2 trillion in total assets, making it the largest U.S. bank by that measure. The officials declined to say which two banks already meet the long-term debt requirements under Friday's proposal.The rules also apply to U.S. operations of foreign globally systemically important banks, establishing roughly parallel requirements as those for U.S. banks, Fed officials said.Also announced was a draft final rule establishing minimum margin requirements for swaps that are not cleared through an exchange. The rule is identical to one proposed by other regulators.A Wells Fargo spokesman said in a statement the bank is reviewing the proposal and it appears to be in line with expectations. Representatives from the other banks either declined comment or were not immediately available.

413,"   By Dan Freed | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Nov 6 Wells Fargo & Co will likely need to issue an additional $20 billion to $40 billion of long-term debt to comply with new rules designed to help banks better weather a crisis, Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said on Friday.The debt issuance would be a relatively small portion of the bank's liabilities, which stood at $1.56 trillion at Sept 30.

425,"   By Dan Freed  Wells Fargo & Co CEO John Stumpf said on Tuesday he disagrees with a new rule designed to boost one of the bank's cushions for absorbing losses.The Federal Reserve's regulation, known as the ""total loss absorbing capacity"" rule, or TLAC, will require the bank to issue another $60 billion of long-term debt.  Asked in an interview on CNBC whether the $60 billion of total loss absorbing capacity makes the bank safer, Stumpf replied, ""Now you're really getting under my neck a little bit, but I don't think that's something that we really needed.""  He added, however, that the bank would be able to manage the issuance.The TLAC requirements, proposed Oct. 30, are aimed at ensuring that some of the biggest and most interconnected banks can better withstand another financial crisis by turning some of their debt, particularly debt issued by their holding companies, into equity without disrupting markets or requiring a government bailout.  The requirement is more difficult for Wells because the bank relies more on deposits, which are less costly than long-term debt, to fund its operations. Securities firms like Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley, which fund themselves with long-term debt, are not expected to have to issue new debt to comply with the rule. A Fed spokesman declined to respond to Stumpf's criticism, but pointed to a statement by Fed Chair Janet Yellen the day the rule was proposed. Yellen said the rule ""would substantially reduce the risk to taxpayers and the threat to financial stability"" from the failure of systemically important firms such as Wells.

440,"   By Dan Freed  It may be Wells Fargo & Co's CEO's favorite business, but the company's wealth management unit's closely watched trust and investment fees declined in the fourth quarter. Choppy markets in the quarter cut Wells Fargo's trust and investment fee revenue by 5 percent to $3.51 billion. That figure includes brokerage advisory, commissions and other fees, trust and investment management and investment banking. Such fees are closely watched by analysts to assess the health of the wealth business. The unit offers mutual funds and other investment products, and serves a range of clients from those with more than $50 million in assets served by its Abbot Downing brand to mass market consumers.In the brutal revenue environment since the financial crisis, Wells Fargo and other banks have turned increasingly to wealth management to boost returns. But because of competitive pressures, tougher regulations and ever shakier markets, that strategy has produced less-than-sterling numbers at Wells. The unit grew revenues according to the measure the bank uses, which includes interest income.ROUGH SLEDDING Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg has estimated that Wells rivals Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp's Merrill Lynch, will post wealth management revenue declines when they report quarterly results on Tuesday.Rafferty Capital Markets analyst Dick Bove said he expects wealth management to be ""one of the businesses that'll do most poorly over the next couple of years"" at banks.Wells CEO John Stumpf does not share that view. At a December conference hosted by Goldman Sachs, he called the wealth investment management division the bank's ""biggest opportunity.""Stumpf said Wells Fargo had room to expand its wealth business, noting that the bank has about 11 percent of U.S. deposits, but just 1 to 2 percent of the wealth.""It's not like the business is not great; it just could be a whole lot bigger,"" Stumpf said. Wells Fargo's ability to sell several products to the same customer is one reason investors value it more generously than banks like J.P. Morgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. But investors are typically reluctant to part with their wealth advisors.""A lot of the clients don't view it as going with the brand: they trust their individual advisor,"" said Michael Mattioli, portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management who owns Wells Fargo shares on behalf of clients.RECRUITING BATTLE CFO John Shrewsberry said Wells Fargo is better than peers at selling wealth management products to retail customers.

441,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 15 (Fitch) Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) reported fourth quarter  2015 (4Q15) results of $5.7 billion in net income for a return on assets (ROA)  of 1.27%, down 1.5% from last quarter. Earnings have remained relatively  consistent over the last five quarters, hovering at  around the $5.7 billion  mark.  Earnings during the quarter were supported by both spread income and controlled  expenses. This was partially offset by higher provision expenses and a large  drop in equity gains, which tend to be the most volatile line item in WFC's  earnings.  Fitch views these results as in line with expectations for WFC, one of the  strongest and most consistent earnings profiles in the industry. The quarter's  results were comparatively stronger than big banks reporting to date given the  U.S.-based focused franchise and absence of capital markets reliance. At year-end 2015, WFC's direct exposure to energy lending is modest at less than  2% of total loans. WFC reported $118 million in net charge-offs (NCOs) or  approximately 2.7% of energy balances on an annualized basis in 4Q15, with $843  million of non-accrual balances. WFC also reported one of the highest reserve  coverage ratios yet at 7% of oil and gas loans. The reserve was based on  customer-by-customer analysis, as well as the forward curve for oil prices,  which are higher than current prices of around $30. WFC's balance of energy-related available-for-sale securities and nonmarketable  securities was $2.5 billion. During the quarter, WFC realized $251 million in  OTTI primarily reflecting marks on energy sector debt and equity investments.  Spread income increased 1.4% on a linked-quarter basis, primarily supported by  growth in loans and securities, as well as higher variable income. Core loan  growth was 2% on a linked-quarter basis, while securities balances grew 1%.  WFC's margin fell 4bps due to continued strong deposit growth, as well as higher  funding costs as WFC issued more long-term debt in preparation for the  previously announced GE capital deals. The GE Railcar Services acquisition  closed on Jan. 1, 2016, and it is anticipated that the commercial distribution  and vendor finance purchase will close in late 1Q16.  Noninterest income declined 4% primarily due to lower equity gains, partially  offset by improved gains on debt securities and trading. Market-sensitive  revenues, which include gains and losses on equity investments, trading  activities, and debt securities, combined with investment banking fees, were  around 6% of total revenues, and can be volatile from quarter to quarter.  However, this level of capital markets revenues is well below WFC's large bank  peers.  Expenses were flat on a sequential basis, primarily due to higher personnel,  equipment and outside professional services, offset by lower operating losses  and foreclosed real estate expenses. Furthermore, last quarter included a  charitable contribution to the Wells Fargo Foundation that did not repeat. The  full-year efficiency ratio was 57.8%, at the higher end of its targeted 55% to  59% efficiency ratio. WFC expects to operate at the higher end of that range in  2016.  For the second quarter in a row, WFC reported the absence of a reserve release  with provision expenses equaling NCOs. WFC attributed the lack of a reserve  release to continued improvement in residential real estate, offset by  deterioration in the energy sector.  Total loan losses ticked up 5bps to a still low 36bps during the quarter due  primarily to the previously mentioned energy-related loan losses. Fitch notes  that at 36bps, WFC's current losses remain well below historical averages for  the company, and we expect some mean reversion for WFC and the industry over the  near- to medium-term. Non-accrual balances fell 4% on a linked-quarter basis  reflecting broad improvement across consumer and commercial loan categories,  offset by energy-related deterioration.  The estimated Common Equity Tier 1 under Basel III Standardized Approach, fully  phased-in, was 10.7% at quarter-end, up approximately 5bps on a linked-quarter  basis. In terms of potential TLAC issuances, WFC reaffirmed its estimate of  between $40 billion to $60 billion in issuance, which Fitch views as very  achievable given an extended phased-in period.

450,"   By Trevor Hunnicutt | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. brokerages are taking steps to change the way their agents trade in an attempt to protect clients from the next big selloff.Wells Fargo & Co, for instance, has instituted an early-warning system that interrupts brokers and advisers trying to enter stop-loss orders, which were accused of inflaming the August ""flash crash"" and resulting in deep losses for some investors.Bank of America Corp's Merrill Lynch unit is discussing whether to ban such orders altogether, according to people outside the company aware of those conversations.Investors with advisers and brokers were among those scarred Aug. 24 when U.S. markets sank so quickly that trading in many stocks and exchange-traded funds was repeatedly halted.Now, when Wells Fargo advisers place stop-losses on ETFs, closed-end funds and some other securities, they see a pop-up warning suggesting a ""limit"" order that could be processed only at a certain price or better. Analyses of summertime trading glitches by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, ETF issuer BlackRock Inc and the New York Stock Exchange blamed stop-loss orders as a primary issue on Aug. 24, warping the market's ability to absorb sales of stocks and ETFs. [nL1N14I1A3] [nL1N1262HK] [nL2N15C3IV]Stop-loss orders allow investors to automatically sell an investment after it hits a pre-determined price. They are used by investors hoping to minimize losses. The problem is that once the target price is reached, stop-losses become ""market"" orders and are executed at the next available price. During fast sell-offs a stock or ETF's price can crash through the stop-loss level, causing the investment to be sold at a lower price.This happened on Aug. 24 when some ETFs and stocks sank 30 percent or more from their prior-day close minutes after trading started, only to recover later that day.Analysts have said making changes to order types could help prevent fast selloffs. The NYSE, owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc, is no longer accepting stop-losses itself. But the exchange said most such orders are launched by brokerages; when a brokerage executes a trade triggered by a stop-loss order, it comes to the exchange simply as a market order. Wells has 15,000 advisers and brokers that manage $1.6 trillion; Merrill has 16,000 such agents that manage $2.5 trillion. The top four wealth managers by assets - Wells, Merrill, Morgan Stanley and UBS AG - hold $407 billion of the $2.2 trillion in U.S. ETFs, according to Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc.A Merrill spokeswoman said the company is educating its advisers on limit orders. Charles Schwab Corp said it still offers stop orders and warns clients of the risks.

457,"   By Olivia Oran and Anjuli Davies | NEW YORK/LONDON  NEW YORK/LONDON When the U.S. Federal Reserve's newest policymaker Neel Kashkari dropped a bombshell with a call to break up big banks on Tuesday, it was met with a predictably indignant response from their lobbyists. One described his comments as ""blind.""     But while no one in the executive suites of major global banks would want authorities to force them to split up or downsize, many top bankers acknowledge that their institutions might be better off smaller and simpler. They just worry that any major restructuring could go all wrong because of the way post-financial crisis regulations are applied.    In interviews with Reuters, six senior bankers said they are struggling with the costs and restrictions they face as a result of new regulations, as well as a weak global economy and troubled financial markets. The bankers, who are or recently were in positions ranging from business division head to CEO, spoke on the condition of anonymity so they could be candid without upsetting regulators or investors.""Fundamentally, the business has to change,"" said one veteran banker who was on the executive committee of a major European bank until recently. Big banks' shareholder returns have sunk ""too low,"" he said.    These problems are not new, but they have fresh relevance as Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE) confronts questions about its capital adequacy, Barclays PLC (BARC.L) faces pressure to break up and CEOs of big U.S. banks struggle with a loss of investor confidence in their stocks. (For a graphic of U.S. banks' price-to-book ratios, see  reut.rs/1SG0NDL)Management teams in the U.S. and Europe are now taking a hard look at dramatic business model changes, but none of the options are particularly attractive, the bankers said.    Merging to cut costs and improve margins is out of the question, given the hurdles banks would likely face from regulators who do not want ""too-big-to-fail"" institutions getting any bigger. Splitting apart is complicated by capital requirements that would make standalone trading businesses economically unfeasible — and by the fact that there are few, if any, buyers for the assets banks want least.Some top bankers say they are left with little choice but to muddle through what they fear will be a long, dark period of weak earnings, angry shareholders and gradual shrinkage.The problem has gotten so bad that Deutsche Bank CEO John Cryan recently said on a public conference call that he'd much rather be CEO of a simpler, retail-focused bank like Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), which has only a modest investment banking operation.""Unfortunately,"" he said, ""there are lots of things I wish for that are not going to come true.""RATCHETING UP CAPITAL Kashkari's comments, in his first speech as head of the Minneapolis Fed, were surprising because he is a former Goldman Sachs banker, a Republican, and was a senior Treasury official in President George W. Bush's administration during the financial crisis. They partly echoed the stance of Bernie Sanders, who has also called for big bank breakups and criticized Hillary Clinton, his rival in the struggle to be the Democratic presidential candidate, for being too close to Wall Street. Some of those vying for the Republican nomination have also criticized regulations brought in after the crisis, saying they would repeal the Dodd-Frank reform law.    In an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, Kashkari criticized Dodd-Frank's so-called ""living will"" rule, which requires banks to show how they can be dismantled in an orderly way if they fail, without creating risk to the broader financial system. Kashkari said he believes the rule would not work in a crisis scenario – that banks would simply be bailed out again.""I challenge anybody who thinks, in a stressed time, we would put these banks through resolution,"" he said. ""I really don't think it will happen.""One way to force large financial firms to break up is to ""aggressively ratchet up"" their capital or leverage requirements, Kashkari said. He warned, though, that banks would likely fight hard against any such proposal.Indeed, Tony Fratto, who worked with Kashkari at the Treasury Department and is now a bank lobbyist at Hamilton Place Strategies, said his former colleague's comments were out of touch with reality.""This is something like re-opening the barn door after the horse is in the stable,"" Fratto said. ""Love or hate Dodd-Frank, it's simply blind to say that it hasn't significantly improved safety and soundness."" OUT OF ARROWS     Securities analysts and consultants say that banks are in an unenviable position because moves they might have made in the past to improve profitability have been hindered by regulation. As a result, they have struggled unsuccessfully for years to get their returns on equity above single digits.    ""In some ways, banks have become bad utilities,"" said Fred Cannon, a bank stock analyst with KBW. ""With utilities, you have strict regulation in what you can do and charge, but in the end investors get a reasonable return. With banks, that last piece hasn't happened.""    Bank executives have long argued that weak returns are a ""cyclical"" issue that should go away when markets begin to flourish again. But as the industry approaches the eighth anniversary of the financial crisis's nadir, questions about whether they face a secular rather than a cyclical profit problem have only grown louder. And top bankers are now wondering how they can possibly grow revenue under a sprawling set of global financial regulations that limit what they do, and sometimes conflict with one another. (For a graphic showing bank earnings and share price performance, see tmsnrt.rs/1mZb4h8)    One common example raised is how new capital rules can penalize banks for being big but also discourage them from getting smaller.    For instance, due to their size, the eight largest U.S. banks must collectively hold $200 billion in extra capital, which weighs on shareholder returns. Included in the capital requirement is a fixed amount each bank must hold to represent ""operational risk."" Although the Fed does not explain exactly how it comes up with that figure, it is not just a function of size: Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) must hold 25 percent more operational risk capital than JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), the biggest bank in the country.Bank of America has said it's taken steps to address the Fed's concerns by cutting back on certain revenue-producing activities that created operational risk. Nonetheless, the bank says it has so far been unable to persuade the Fed to reduce that capital requirement. Its shareholder returns suffer as a result, because revenue is dropping faster than capital costs.""Every bank is trying to figure out, with bigger capital requirements and profit pressure, how can they create acceptable returns for their shareholders,"" said John Weisel, an Ernst & Young executive who advises global banks on business strategy.    After years of cost-cutting, he said, CEOs are asking themselves: ""We've used all the arrows in our quiver, so what are we going to do next?""BREAK-UP DEMANDS     European banks are behind their U.S. competitors in addressing a more regulated environment and, in some cases, are flailing around for answers.Last week, Deutsche Bank shares hit an all-time low on worries that it won't be able to buy back some bonds that can convert into equity. Deutsche regained some value after it outlined plans to repurchase $5.38 billion worth of other bonds, but investors' concerns don't seem to have been entirely assuaged.    Meanwhile, Barclays has come under pressure after a Bernstein analyst wrote an open letter on Feb. 5 imploring CEO Jes Staley to break up the bank.    Rob McDonough, who advises financial institutions on risk management at Angel Oak Consulting Group, says megabanks may have little choice but to get significantly smaller.

462,"   By Olivia Oran and Greg Roumeliotis  Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), in a bid to boost its dealmaking franchise, is hunting for a new head of mergers and acquisitions, according to people familiar with the matter.    The bank's existing head of mergers, John Laughlin, has moved to a vice chairman role, a spokeswoman said.     Wells is looking for a senior dealmaker who can help the bank win roles on high-profile transactions in which it has not historically been a part, the sources said. Wells, based in San Francisco, has its East Coast headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina, which is where Laughlin has been based and where many of its bankers sit - rather than in New York, the hub of Wall Street banking.    ""John Laughlin's appointment to vice chairman recognizes the key role he played in leading a fivefold increase in our M&A business,"" said Rob Engel, head of investment banking and capital markets at Wells Fargo.     Wells has seen its stock price and return on equity rewarded for focusing on wealth management and Main Street lending, and this latest move reflects a desire to build out its investment banking franchise.     Although the bank is consistently ranked as one of the top lenders to corporate America, it has lagged in traditional investment banking areas like financial advisory and capital markets.    The bank posted about $2 billion in U.S. investment banking fees in 2015, according to Thomson Reuters data, ranking it eighth among peers. JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) generated fees nearly double that of Wells.     Wells captured a 4.7 percent share of U.S investment banking fees, and has climbed less than 1 percent since 2008, when it acquired Wachovia to build up its banking business.    The bank did not crack the Top 20 for advising on announced U.S. mergers and acquisitions last year.    Rival bank executives are convinced Wells may soon make further inroads into investment banking.    ""Wells Fargo is very actively, very aggressively, and very successfully building its U.S. investment bank,"" JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon told Bloomberg in March. Dimon said that for Wells to remain competitive, it will need to expand overseas, which may require buying another bank. Wells, however, has tended to downplay its investment banking ambitions, describing it as one more way to serve corporate customers. The more modest view has won favor with investors, who have rewarded Wells with a higher price-to-book value than banks such as JPMorgan. Wells trades at 1.48 times book value, compared with JPMorgan's 1.03 times book.

The company was named after Schilling's Major League jersey number.The charge stems from a $75 million bond offering in 2010 that was part of a Rhode Island program intended to spur economic development, the SEC said.Wells Fargo disputes the SEC's allegations and will respond to them in court, a spokesman said. The state's economic development agency, the Rhode Island Commerce Corp, is reviewing the SEC's complaint, a spokeswoman said. The agency previously filed a lawsuit against Wells accusing it of not disclosing material information about the 38 Studios deal to its board and investors, the spokeswoman said. That lawsuit also names two former executives of the agency.The Rhode Island Commerce Corp did not tell investors that 38 Studios faced a funding shortfall to produce a particular video game, the SEC said in its complaint.The state agency loaned $50 million to 38 Studios, which needed another $25 million to produce the game. Unable to get the extra money, 38 Studios defaulted on the loan without producing the video game, the SEC said. Wells and its lead banker in the offering, Peter Cannava, who is also charged in the case, misled investors by not telling them about a side deal with 38 Studios, the SEC said. Wells received nearly double the amount of compensation it had disclosed to investors in offering documents because of that deal, according to the SEC.Cannava's lawyer, Brian Kelly, said the allegations ""lack merit.""

492,"   By Jonathan Stempel  April 8 - Wells Fargo & Co admitted to deceiving the U.S. government into insuring thousands of risky mortgages, as it formally reached a record $1.2 billion settlement of a U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit.The settlement with Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. mortgage lender and third-largest U.S. bank by assets, was filed on Friday in Manhattan federal court. It also resolves claims against Kurt Lofrano, a former Wells Fargo vice president.According to the settlement, Wells Fargo ""admits, acknowledges, and accepts responsibility"" for having from 2001 to 2008 falsely certified that many of its home loans qualified for Federal Housing Administration insurance.The San Francisco-based lender also admitted to having from 2002 to 2010 failed to file timely reports on several thousand loans that had material defects or were badly underwritten, a process that Lofrano was responsible for supervising.According to the Justice Department, the shortfalls led to substantial losses for taxpayers when the FHA was forced to pay insurance claims as defective loans soured. Several lenders, including Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc, Deutsche Bank AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co, previously settled similar federal lawsuits.But Wells Fargo held out, and its payment is the largest in FHA history over loan origination violations.Friday's settlement is a reproach for ""years of reckless underwriting"" at Wells Fargo, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan said in a statement. ""While Wells Fargo enjoyed huge profits from its FHA loan business, the government was left holding the bag when the bad loans went bust,"" Bharara added.The accord also resolved a probe by federal prosecutors in California of alleged false loan certifications by American Mortgage Network LLC, which Wells Fargo bought in 2009. No one has been criminally charged in the probes, and the Justice Department reserved the right to pursue criminal charges if it wishes, according to the settlement.Franklin Codel, president of Wells Fargo Home Lending, in a statement said the settlement ""allows us to put the legal process behind us, and to focus our resources and energy on what we do best -- serving the needs of the nation's homeowners.""Lewis Liman, a lawyer for Lofrano, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Wells Fargo on Feb. 3 said the settlement would reduce its previously reported 2015 profit by $134 million, to account for extra legal expenses.The case is U.S. v.

But Wells Fargo held out, and its payment is the largest in FHA history over loan origination violations.Friday's settlement is a reproach for ""years of reckless underwriting"" at Wells Fargo, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan said in a statement.""While Wells Fargo enjoyed huge profits from its FHA loan business, the government was left holding the bag when the bad loans went bust,"" Bharara added. The accord also resolved a probe by federal prosecutors in California of alleged false loan certifications by American Mortgage Network LLC, which Wells Fargo bought in 2009.No one has been criminally charged in the probes, and the Justice Department reserved the right to pursue criminal charges if it wishes, according to the settlement.Franklin Codel, president of Wells Fargo Home Lending, in a statement said the settlement ""allows us to put the legal process behind us, and to focus our resources and energy on what we do best -- serving the needs of the nation's homeowners.""

The remaining $290.5 billion of Wells Fargo's commercial and industrial loan portfolio was classified as ""pass.""Criticized loans range from those with potential weaknesses to essentially worthless ones that should no longer count as assets on bank balance sheets.Wells Fargo's total energy-related exposure, including funded and unfunded loans, decreased $317 million to $43.5 billion in the quarter, the filing said.  Wells Fargo and other banks have beefed up reserves for possible loan losses as sharply lower oil prices have made it difficult for energy companies to repay their debts. Wells Fargo has been one of the most aggressive large banks in providing equity and second lien financing to small exploration and production companies in the sector.In its quarterly filing on Friday, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) said its criticized loans to the oil and gas industry more than doubled to $9.7 billion at the end of March. Wells Fargo did not specify what portion of its oil and gas loans were criticized.

515,"   By David Ingram  A former employee accused Wells Fargo & Co of instructing workers at a call center to refrain from telling customers about lost deeds or other missing documents, and of firing the worker who called the policy unethical, according to a lawsuit made public this week.Duke Tran, who was a customer service specialist at the bank, says that his supervisor berated him for telling a husband and wife that their loan contract was missing from an internal system.Tran and others later received an email instructing them not to tell customers about situations ""where we have a lost contract, deed, any type of document, really, but especially when it relates to securing a property,"" according to a copy of the email filed with the lawsuit.The email told the employees ""to say that we need to do further research or something similar"" and then to escalate the phone call to a boss.Representatives for Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, declined to comment on Friday. Like other major lenders, Wells Fargo has been battered by lawsuits over its conduct before and after the 2008 financial crisis. Last month, it admitted to deceiving the U.S. government into insuring thousands of risky mortgages and agreed to pay $1.2 billion.The U.S. Department of Justice had an option to join Tran in his case because his suit alleges fraud on the government. It has declined to do so. That is typically a sign the department thinks a lawsuit is unlikely to succeed. Tran filed his lawsuit in June 2015 under court seal, which is common for suits alleging fraud on the government. U.S. District Judge Anna Brown in Portland, Oregon, ordered the papers unsealed on Thursday. The lawsuit seeks damages and an injunction.Tran's trouble began around December 2013 when he took a call from a husband and wife about an upcoming balloon payment on a mortgage, according to the lawsuit. Tran told them the bank's copy of the loan contract was missing, and when he reported the issue to a supervisor, he was told his job was in jeopardy, the suit says.  Other customers also had loan documents missing, and many of their loans had been acquired by Wells Fargo from First Union or SunTrust Bank, according to the lawsuit.Tran was fired in November 2014 after more than 10 years with the bank, the lawsuit said.

520,"   By Dan Freed  Wells Fargo & Co lowered two key financial targets on Tuesday and said it was sharply cutting exposure to troubled energy loans, signaling that tough times for bank profits may continue through the rest of the year.Low interest rates, higher capital requirements and increasing credit costs are weighing on Wells Fargo's results, prodding the San Francisco-based lender to reduce its targets for returns on assets and on shareholder equity.In a presentation pegged to its biennial investor day event, Wells said it was targeting a return on assets of 1.1 percent to 1.4 percent this year, down from the 1.3 to 1.6 percent it detailed at its investor day in 2014. The bank's full-year return-on-equity target was now 11 percent to 14 percent, down from 12 percent to 15 percent.Analysts said they were expecting the news, given the difficulties banks face in terms of interest rates, markets and regulations.""We don't view Wells Fargo's cuts to its target as surprising,"" Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Ramsden said in a note.  Since Wells Fargo's 2014 guidance, it has taken steps to prepare for lower interest rates for a longer period of time. As a result, the bank said it would benefit less if interest rates suddenly jolt upward. Federal Reserve officials recently signaled that the U.S. central bank could be on track to raise interest rates in June or July. Wells said it now expected its net interest margin would rise 5 to 15 basis points if the yield curve shifted upward by 100 basis points. Its prior expectation was for a net interest margin benefit of 10 to 30 basis points from such a move. A basis point is one hundredth of 1 percent. Energy loans have been a sore spot for banks in recent quarters due to the long-running oil price rout that put many borrowers in dire financial straits. Wells Fargo was particularly aggressive in lending to energy companies when the sector was booming, and it was now taking steps to reduce its exposure.Wells Fargo's finance chief, John Shrewsberry, said the bank was more than halfway through a reassessment of loans to energy companies involved in exploration and production, and has cut credit lines for 68 percent of those it has reviewed.In its presentation, Wells said it expected ""continued stress"" in its book of oil and gas loans throughout 2016.

527,"   By Philip Scipio  NEW YORK, May 25 (IFR) - To the surprise of exactly no one, Wells Fargo played down talk of expansion in its investment banking business during this week's investor day presentations.The world's biggest bank by market cap remains coy about its ambitions, deflecting analyst questions and trying to assuage concerns about mission creep into uncharted waters.But ever since JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon said earlier this year that Wells was aggressively building its investment bank - and that it was ""almost impossible"" to build one from scratch - the bank has been a bit on the defensive about the issue.Jon Weiss, the head of the investment banking Wells Fargo Securities arm, walked the tightrope, acknowledging that the unit was growing while trying very hard to say it really wasn't.""We are not talking about a massive investment in a new business,"" he said. ""To the extent that we are growing, we are going to do it the Wells Fargo way - with discipline.""That appeared to rule out any possibility that Wells would opt to acquire an investment bank, which Dimon's decree suggested was the bank's only way forward.""The likelihood that would ever make an acquisition in investment banking is very, very remote,"" said Tim Sloan, Wells Fargo's head of wholesale banking.""We don't think that we need to do it.""RISKY SOUR  Many analysts agree with that assessment.Rafferty Capital analyst Dick Bove said Wells Fargo already has the distribution, capital and customer base to break into the top ranks of investment banking without an acquisition.""Of the top six banks, five are trading at a discount to book value,"" he told IFR.""The one bank that isn't is arguing that they don't get involved in areas of high risk,"" Bove said.""Wells Fargo's dilemma is that if it says it is aggressively moving into capital market activities, the multiple on its stock will go down."" Weiss insists the bank has actually been lowering risk even as it expands.""While we have built out activities such as liquid products, mortgages and prime brokerage - and our business has grown consistently over the years - value-at-risk and other measures of risk have actually gone down,"" he said.FEELING SECURE For now, the bank said, Wells Fargo Securities accounts for roughly 6% of overall revenue and said it would likely stay in that range. The group has about 4,500 industry and product investment bankers, sales and trading professionals research and analysts and support staff.More than 90% of its revenue comes from the United States, and 95% of its team members are based in the US.The investment bank derives roughly 60% of its revenue from origination and 40% from trading; fixed income represents about 28% of that, compared to 13% from equity trading.Sales and trading is focused on distributing and making markets in securities issued by clients, rather than trading for the sake of trading, Weiss said.In origination, real estate is the bank's largest sector, accounting for 28% of revenue, followed by consumer, healthcare and gaming at 19%.As it builds into new segments, Weiss said, Wells would focus on hiring people, rather than paying a premium to buy a business.He said building as it goes gives Wells the freedom to design and scale new businesses based on current client needs, consistent with the new regulatory framework.That also allows the bank to avoid the legacy issues that plagued JP Morgan and Bank of America, he said.For his part Sloan, the head of wholesale banking, said the times have simply changed.""People have realized that you can't prostitute your balance sheet to get a fee.""

536,"   By Liana B. Baker  Longtime Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN.S) investment banker David DeNunzio is leaving the Swiss bank to become global head of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) at Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), according to people familiar with the matter. DeNunzio was formerly the global chairman of M&A at Credit Suisse.At Wells Fargo, DeNunzio will partner with Sam Farnham, an investment banker who will be promoted to become head of M&A in the Americas, the people added, requesting not to be named because the moves have not yet been announced.Farnham was formerly head of middle market investment banking. John Laughlin, the former head of M&A, will become a vice chairman of M&A, according to the people.  Representatives from Wells Fargo and Credit Suisse declined to comment. Bloomberg first reported the news on Friday.DeNunzio worked at Credit Suisse for more than 25 years and had been global chairman of M&A since 2012. He joined the M&A group of the First Boston Corp in 1989, a year before it was merged into Credit Suisse, after nine years at Kidder, Peabody & Co. Wells Fargo, a San Francisco-based lender known for its retail banking business, is a relatively small player in investment banking compared to other U.S. giants JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Corp. It is bulking up its practice, however, and has started to land larger deals. In March, Wells Fargo was named sole adviser to TransCanada Corp on its acquisition of Columbia Pipeline Group, a deal worth $13 billion including debt, putting it on track for its biggest fees from a single deal since at least 2000, according to data from Thomson Reuters and Freeman Consulting Services.Credit Suisse has seen several bankers depart in recent months. Last month it lost a managing director in New York who went to Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), five bankers in San Francisco who joined Jefferies LLC and two in Chicago who were hired at Macquarie Group Ltd (MQG.AX).

537,"   By Liana B. Baker | June 3  June 3 Longtime Credit Suisse Group AG  investment banker David DeNunzio is leaving the Swiss bank to become global head of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) at Wells Fargo & Co, according to people familiar with the matter.DeNunzio was formerly the global chairman of M&A at Credit Suisse.At Wells Fargo, DeNunzio will partner with Sam Farnham, an investment banker who will be promoted to become head of M&A in the Americas, the people added, requesting not to be named because the moves have not yet been announced. Farnham was formerly head of middle market investment banking. John Laughlin, the former head of M&A, will become a vice chairman of M&A, according to the people.Representatives from Wells Fargo and Credit Suisse declined to comment. Bloomberg first reported the news on Friday. DeNunzio worked at Credit Suisse for more than 25 years and had been global chairman of M&A since 2012. He joined the M&A group of the First Boston Corp in 1989, a year before it was merged into Credit Suisse, after nine years at Kidder, Peabody & Co.Wells Fargo, a San Francisco-based lender known for its retail banking business, is a relatively small player in investment banking compared to other U.S. giants JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Corp. It is bulking up its practice, however, and has started to land larger deals. In March, Wells Fargo was named sole adviser to TransCanada Corp on its acquisition of Columbia Pipeline Group, a deal worth $13 billion including debt, putting it on track for its biggest fees from a single deal since at least 2000, according to data from Thomson Reuters and Freeman Consulting Services.Credit Suisse has seen several bankers depart in recent months. Last month it lost a managing director in New York who went to Goldman Sachs Group Inc, five bankers in San Francisco who joined Jefferies LLC and two in Chicago who were hired at Macquarie Group Ltd.Credit Suisse has also hired three bankers this year, including Marco Chisari and Haidee Lee, who start in July. Chisari will focus on technology M&A while Lee will be head of sellside M&A Americas. Jason Truman, a healthcare banker, started at Credit Suisse in February.      (Reporting by Liana B.

553,"   By Dan Freed and Nikhil Subba  Top Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) executives were grilled by analysts on Friday about whether they're doing enough to control expenses after the bank reported a drop in second-quarter profit.Like its big bank peers, Wells Fargo has been challenged by a prolonged period of historically low interest rates, which only fell further in the second quarter.Even as the San Francisco-based lender extended more loans, its profits fell 3.5 percent because it has started setting aside more money for possible losses in the future.Revenue growth was not enough to offset those increased provisions, as well as higher costs elsewhere. The expense line was boosted by standard operating costs like compliance and personnel, as well as investments in things like biometric scanners and technology to approve loans more quickly.Wells Fargo's shares fell 3 percent in afternoon trading following the results.At least five analysts asked Chief Executive John Stumpf and Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry about those operating expenses during a conference call on Friday, and whether they can come down any further.Though Wells Fargo is at the high end of a cost-efficiency range that management has set out, the two executives argued that costs are necessary for either day-to-day business or long-term investments that will pay off.""A lower for longer (interest rate) scenario puts pressure on everything that we do,"" Stumpf responded to one analyst who acknowledged he might be ""beating a dead horse"" by asking again about costs. ""We are not going to do something that is short-term bright, long-term dull just because of pressure on the revenue side or the earnings side,"" Stumpf continued. ""We will continue to work really hard on … taking out costs that don't add value.""Wells, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, reported net income applicable to common shareholders of $5.2 billion in the second quarter, down from $5.4 billion a year earlier. Revenue rose 4 percent to $22.2 billion.Earnings per share slipped to $1.01 from $1.03, matching the average analyst forecast, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Wells Fargo's second-quarter results compare to better-than-expected profit declines of 1 percent at JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and 14 percent at Citigroup Inc (C.N). All three banks described healthy loan growth in their core businesses, and largely blamed low rates for the profit declines.When rates get too low, the gap between what it costs a bank to obtain funding and what it can earn from investing or lending tends to narrow. Wells' net interest margin - which measures interest income as a portion of assets - declined on both an annual and quarterly basis. Banks have tried to keep a handle on expenses to offset the impact of low rates. Wells Fargo management has said the bank will keep expenses as a portion of revenue, known as an efficiency ratio, in a range of 55 to 59 percent this year. In the second quarter, its efficiency ratio was 58.1 percent.The industry is also lending more to boost income, a sign of strength for the U.S. economy. Wells reported loan growth across commercial loans, auto loans, credit cards and residential mortgages. Stumpf noted that consumer spending on ""big-ticket items was especially robust"" during the quarter.Wells Fargo's $950.8 billion worth of average loans during the quarter was 9 percent above the year-ago and 3 percent higher than the prior period.It was the 16th consecutive quarter of loan growth for the San Francisco-based bank. But with that growth has come the need to boost reserves against loan losses that are possible in the future. Wells' provisions for loan losses of $1.1 billion more than tripled from the year-ago quarter, and were 49-percent higher than the first quarter. The bank said its overall credit quality was ""solid,"" with the exception of its oil and gas portfolio, which has come under pressure due to the decline in energy prices.Wells Fargo is the biggest U.S. mortgage lender, but faced some particular challenges in that business.Its mortgage banking revenue fell 17 percent even amid a wave of new business. The decline came from its mortgage-servicing portfolio, where hedges on the direction of interest rates were less effective, and where the bank also faced higher costs.Up to Thursday's close, Wells Fargo's stock had dropped about 10 percent since the start of the year, but it remained the most highly valued U.S. bank.Although Wells' results were generally in line with expectations, Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski said they were ""an indication of how difficult revenue growth is to come by.""

Big brokerages must also be careful not to alienate those just below the top wealth bracket, who produce leaner margins, but represent a bigger chunk of the business, analysts say.If neglected, customers like Frank can drift to digital platforms, or robo advisers, such as Betterment or Wealthfront, which use algorithms and have low fees and tiny account minimums.Most big brokerages are developing their own robo platforms, or planning to partner with one. Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, UBS and Wells Fargo also have call centers that can serve small clients, hoping it will help keep them while allowing advisers to focus on big accounts.""People with certain levels of wealth have issues that are very distinct,"" said Brad DeHond, a Morgan Stanley financial adviser in Chicago who focuses on clients with more than $20 million in assets. ""It isn't a matter of just having some extra zeroes at the end of their statements.""

575,"  NEW YORK Wells Fargo & Company named David Kowach to head its retail wealth management division, Wells Fargo Advisors, the nation's third-largest brokerage, on Thursday.Kowach was promoted from his job overseeing roughly 11,000 brokers in the bank's Private Client Group. He succeeds Mary Mack, who left Wells Fargo Advisors last month to head up Wells' community banking business.Kowach, a 25-year veteran of the financial services industry, was focused on recruitment, retention, growth and sales during the more than four years he led the Private Client Group, Wells Fargo's largest wealth management business. In his new role, he will takes on managing an additional 4,000 bankers under the Wells Fargo Advisors umbrella.Kowach enters the role at a time when the full-service brokerage industry is undergoing major regulatory and technology changes. A new Department of Labor rule that takes effect in April 2017 has sparked an industry overhaul as wealth management businesses big and small scramble to decipher which products and business practices meet the rule's fiduciary standard.The cost of compliance industry-wide is expected to reach as much as $31.5 billion in the next decade, which will result in higher costs to serve mass affluent investors who make up a large portion of the St. Louis-based brokerage's clientele. Wells Fargo Advisors is working to roll out a pilot version of a robo adviser in first half of 2017 in order to have more options for clients who want to pay lower fees or prefer digital options.Wells also made a play last year to target wealthier clients by recruiting more than 100 private bankers from Credit Suisse Group AG when the Swiss bank sold off its U.S.-based brokerage business, many of whom took jobs in Kowach's old division. Wells Fargo, which said it would name Kowach's successor shortly, did not make him available for interviews.

578,"   By Suzanne Barlyn  A Wells Fargo & Co unit will pay $4.1 million to settle allegations that it engaged in illegal private student loan servicing practices that unfairly penalized certain borrowers, the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB) said on Monday.The bureau said it identified breakdowns throughout Wells Fargo's servicing process, including failing to provide important payment information to consumers, charging illegal fees and failing to update inaccurate credit report information.Wells neither admitted nor denied the charges, the bureau said. The settlement resolves three areas of concern related to ""procedures that were retired or improved many years ago, and addresses the impact to a small number of customers,"" a Wells Fargo spokesman said. The procedures at issue were either retired or corrected between 2011 and 2013.The $4.1 million sum includes a $3.6 million penalty to the bureau and a $410,000 fund for borrowers. Last year, the CFPB found that more than 8 million U.S. borrowers are in default on more than $110 billion in student loans. Breakdowns in student loan servicing may be driving the problem, the bureau said.Student loans make up the second largest U.S. consumer debt market with roughly $1.3 trillion owed by borrowers who took out federal and private loans, the bureau said. Loans from private lenders are a small fraction of that amount, totaling about $100 billion owed. But they are often used by borrowers with high debt levels who also have federal loans, the CFPB said.The bureau said the bank processed payments in a way that made consumers pay more fees. If a borrower's payment was not enough to cover the total amount due for all loans in an account, the bank divided that payment among the loans in a way that maximized late fees rather than satisfying payments for some of the loans, the bureau said.Wells Fargo's Sioux Falls, South Dakota-based education finance unit services about 1.3 million U.S. consumers, the CFPB said.",2016-08-22,WFC,"Mon Aug 22, 2016 | 3:53pm EDT",Wells Fargo to pay $4.1 mln to settle charges of illegal student loan practices,http://www.reuters.com//article/wells-fargo-loans-fine-idUSL1N1B31B6?type=companyNews

586,"  ZURICH Credit Suisse Chairman Urs Rohner aims to stay in office beyond 2018, he told German newspaper Handelsblatt, confident that his and Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam's strategy will revive the struggling Swiss bank.Shares in Credit Suisse closed on Tuesday at 12.53 Swiss francs, lingering near record lows amid tough financial markets and concerns over the bank's capital position.But the surprise second-quarter profit announced last month provided a lift for management's push to move Switzerland's second-biggest bank away from volatile, capital-intensive investment banking and focus on wealth management. ""We have developed a common strategy with plenty of thought and we are convinced it is the right one,"" Rohner told Handelsblatt. ""And our big investors are behind our alignment."" Challenges remain, however, and the bank has lost a number of senior staff this year, including global chairman of M&A David DeNunzio, who joined Wells Fargo & Co, and a group of five investment bankers who left for Jefferies Group in May.Rohner, whose post is renewed annually, also told the newspaper that the continued independence of some large European banks may hinge on finding others to manage centralized services, such as customer account data.   ""I can imagine that a third party could do that for a series of banks,"" he said. ""If multiple banks would join up, the resulting IT infrastructure organization could be sold in an IPO on the stock exchange."" Rohner's comments echoed the thought processes of other Swiss bankers, including UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti, who recently said he thinks the industry may need to form such alliances to share economies of scale and lower costs.

617,"   By Dan Freed and Lisa Lambert | NEW YORK/WASHINGTON  NEW YORK/WASHINGTON Wells Fargo & Co  scrapped its product sales goals for retail bankers on Tuesday and may take further disciplinary action against its employees in the wake of a fake account scandal that has already led to $190 million in fines and the firing of 5,300 employees.Wells Fargo has been hit hard by allegations its staff opened more than 2 million bank accounts and credit cards for customers without their consent in a bid to meet internal sales goals.Politicians are calling for an investigation, and Wells Fargo and regulators are expected to testify in the Senate next week.One of the United States' largest and most respected financial institutions, Wells Fargo built itself into the most valuable U.S. bank after the financial crisis partly because it did not rely on risky trades or complex derivatives to turn a profit.But the company's shares have lost around 7 percent of their value since last week, when U.S. regulators unveiled the fines against the bank , and it has ceded its position as the largest U.S. bank by market capitalization to rival JPMorgan Chase & Co .Wells Fargo - which was long the envy of the banking industry for its ability to sell multiple products to the same customer - agreed to pay $185 million in fines and $5 million to customers last week after reaching a settlement with three regulators over the alleged sales abuses.The phantom accounts meant that some customers were charged for insufficient funds, according to the regulators.During a CNBC appearance on Tuesday evening, Chief Executive John Stumpf apologized and said management takes responsibility for the problems identified in the settlement. Although the bank has eliminated sales goals for retail staff, Stumpf said ""cross-selling"" products from various businesses to customers is still important to growing its business. ""We still love-cross selling,"" he said, later adding, ""Cross-sell is shorthand for deep, long-term relationships. We love that.""Even after firing more than 2 percent of its staff for improper selling, Wells Fargo is still examining its practices, Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said earlier in the day.The bank will ""take a big wide fresh look at who knew what and when and what else might have been done,"" he said speaking at an industry conference.Shrewsberry said the review would impact people ""at all levels of the organization."" Carrie Tolstedt, the head of the bank's retail operations where the abuses are alleged to have occurred, stepped down in July. The controversy has led to calls for the bank to claw back bonuses paid to her.Tolstedt received a pay raise in March, after getting more than $9 million in cash and stock last year. She left with more than 2.5 million in Wells Fargo shares, currently worth around $120 million.A Wells Fargo spokeswoman said Tolstedt had ""made a decision to retire at the end of this year."" Tolstedt could not be reached for comment.Stumpf said clawback decisions are determined by the board of directors, and that product sales goals are not a component of compensation for any senior executives. POLITICAL HEAT The bank's practices have also drawn scrutiny from Washington, with staff members for the Senate Banking Committee, which oversees the banking industry, set to meet with representatives of the bank.Stumpf, Cordray and Tom Curry, from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, will testify before the committee next week.Torrie Matous, spokeswoman for the committee's chairman, Richard Shelby, a Republican from Alabama, said staff had ""been arranging briefings and collecting information from both Wells Fargo and the regulators"" to prepare for a Sept. 20 hearing.Five Democrats on the committee, including Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have pressed for an investigation.The top Democrat on the banking committee, Ohio's Senator Sherrod Brown, wants the panel to probe deeper than a single hearing, ""so we can get answers on how this massive fraud happened, what's being done to make customers whole, and how to put safeguards in place to protect against its recurrence.""",2016-09-14,WFC,"Wed Sep 14, 2016 | 10:03am EDT",Wells Fargo seeks to shore up reputation in wake of scandal,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-banks-wells-fargo-idUSL2N1BQ0IA?type=companyNews

Well Fargo's shares have lost about 6 percent of their value since last week, when U.S. regulators unveiled the fines.

630,"   By Ross Kerber | CAMBRIDGE, Mass.  CAMBRIDGE, Mass. The U.S. Comptroller of the Currency said a recent case against Wells Fargo & Co  concerning phantom accounts highlights the risks other banks face in their efforts to sell new products to existing customers.The comptroller, Thomas Curry, said on Thursday that other banks should review what risks may arise from efforts to ""cross-sell"" to existing customers, which he called a common strategy.""We expect banks to assess and to mitigate those risks in advance and on an ongoing basis,"" said Curry, speaking to Reuters after giving a speech at Harvard University.

Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf told the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday that customers who had bogus accounts opened in their name will be made whole and compensated for any damage to their credit rating, but some Democratic senators called for his resignation.Under fire, Stumpf said he has told his managers to do ""whatever it takes"" to make customers whole, refunding fees or compensating them for damage to their credit ratings.

The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau has proposed a ban on such clauses that prohibit class-action lawsuits.Earlier this month, the lender agreed to pay $190 million in penalties and customer payouts to settle the case involving the creation of credit, savings and other accounts without customers' knowledge.

649,"  WASHINGTON Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton took on the Wells Fargo & Co bogus-accounts case in a letter to the bank's customers to be released on Tuesday, when Wells Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf will testify before a Senate committee.Clinton, who faced accusations during her party's primary elections of representing Wall Street's interests, said in the letter that Stumpf ""owes all of you a clear explanation as to how this happened under his watch."" Earlier this month, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other regulators announced a $185 million settlement with the bank for creating 2 million phantom accounts under actual customers' names in a bid to meet internal sales goals. In the letter sent to customers, Clinton laid out a three-prong plan to address what she called ""the culture of misconduct and recklessness"" in the banking system. It included ""clawing back"" the compensation of individual executives involved in wrongdoing and breaking up big banks that are not managed effectively. She also called for maintaining the CFPB, an agency created in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law that Republican lawmakers would like to reorganize.

650,"   By Patrick Rucker and Dan Freed  U.S. Senate lawmakers excoriated Wells Fargo & Co's chief on Tuesday for his oversight of the bank as it opened 2 million bogus customer accounts, potentially laying the groundwork for new rules and reviving questions of whether banks are ""too big to fail."" Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf told the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday that customers who had bogus accounts opened in their name will be made whole and compensated for any damage to their credit rating, but some Democratic senators called for his resignation.Under fire, Stumpf said he has told his managers to do ""whatever it takes"" to make customers whole, refunding fees or compensating them for damage to their credit ratings. But he stood behind the former executive who ran the unit that oversaw many of the practices, and at times downplayed the scope of the affair.In answer to a question, he declined to commit to setting aside mandatory arbitration agreements that prohibit clients from suing Wells Fargo. The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau has proposed a ban on such clauses that prohibit class-action lawsuits.Earlier this month, the lender agreed to pay $190 million in penalties and customer payouts to settle the case involving the creation of credit, savings and other accounts without customers' knowledge. About $5 million will directly go to customers, many of whom might have paid a small fee on the unwanted accounts.The revelations are a severe hit to Wells Fargo's reputation. During the financial crisis, the bank trumpeted itself as conservative, in contrast to its rivals. Besides potential criminal charges against the company and its executives, Wells Fargo may face pressure from shareholders to change its practices on executive pay and governance. The scandal also renewed debate over whether U.S. banks are ""too big to fail"" and need closer government oversight to prevent a massive collapse. Lawmakers could use the fraud settlement as a springboard for new rules on executive pay, including clawbacks of compensation, and limits on forced arbitration.Wells Fargo has said its board will assess whether to cancel or claw back any incentive compensation paid to a now-retired executive at the center of the scandal, Carrie Tolstedt. Democratic Senators Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts called for Stumpf to resign, with Warren saying Stumpf should give back his salary and be criminally investigated.  ""You should resign. You should give back the money you took while this scam was going on, and you should be criminally investigated,"" Warren said. The bank's board of directors is examining what action it should take against company executives, Stumpf told the committee.        ""I accept full responsibility for all unethical sales practices,"" Stumpf said, adding later, ""I apologize to all of the American people and our customers, and I will make it right."" Lawmakers said the phony bank accounts might have hurt customer credit ratings, increased the cost of a mortgage or car loan. New credit card applications and consumer borrowing trends can weight on an individual's credit.""WHERE WAS MANAGEMENT?""   Wells Fargo has acknowledged bank employees ""inappropriately opened"" the customer accounts and that about 5,300 employees were fired over five years.Former bank employees say they were under intense pressure to add accounts for each customer.    Abuses were found as early as 2011, Stumpf said, but bank executives only realized the scale of the problem early last year.At that time, Stumpf said, managers came to recognize how a pattern of creating phony accounts could be used to boost unwarranted fees.“It never dawned on us that there could be a cycle,” the CEO said.“It just sort of begs the issue of where was management,” said Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the senior Democrat on the panel. Brown said employees were caught ""forging signatures, and stealing identities, Social Security numbers, and customers’ hard-earned cash, so as to hang on to their low-paying jobs and make money for the high-paying executives at Wells Fargo.""Thomas Curry, the Comptroller of the Currency, said the agency is considering action against individual Wells Fargo executives who may have violated laws or regulations. The U.S. Attorney's Offices in Manhattan and in San Francisco are investigating Wells Fargo, a person familiar with the matter said last week. While Democratic lawmakers were the most outspoken in their attacks, Republicans also grilled Stumpf.Louisiana Senator David Vitter pressed the CEO on how  customer fraud could persist for years and thousands of employees could be fired before the head of the bank got involved.“Why isn’t this crystal clear proof that an entity as big as Wells is not only too big to fail but it’s too big to manage and too big to regulate?” Vitter asked.Stumpf said the widespread abuse was “a problem of focus and not of size.”Stumpf appeared before the congressional panel with a bandaged right hand. He suffered an injury playing with his grandchildren, according to the bank. Wells Fargo shares rose 2 percent to $46.94.

A Wells Fargo spokeswoman could not be immediately reached for comment after the close of business Monday but the company previously apologized to affected customers and said it fired 5,300 employees over ""inappropriate sales conduct.""The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau alleged that the opening of these accounts was driven by a system that financially rewarded employees. Federal prosecutors have since launched a criminal probe into the issue, a source previously told Reuters. The Labor Department polices a variety of things, including wage and hour rules, workplace safety, whistleblower protection laws and employee benefit plans.Perez said that the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has received a number of whistleblower complaints from Wells Fargo employees over the past five years.Most of those complaints are concluded, with some settling and others found to have no merit, he said. Others are still currently under investigation, he added. ""I have asked OSHA to review the entire docket of both closed and open Wells Fargo cases since 2010,"" he said.Senator Warren, in a statement to Reuters, welcomed the department's review.""Every other federal agency with jurisdiction in this matter should follow DOL’s lead and promptly determine whether Wells Fargo and its senior executives should be prosecuted or otherwise sanctioned,"" she said.

680,"  Embattled Wells Fargo & Co plans to eliminate sales goals for its retail banking business sooner than planned, according to prepared remarks its chief executive officer will deliver at a congressional hearing on Thursday.Wells Fargo is under pressure to show it is holding top brass accountable after government investigators discovered that  employees opened as many as 2 million accounts without customers' knowledge in order to meet sales targets.On Tuesday, Wells Fargo said CEO John Stumpf will forfeit unvested equity awards worth about $41 million and will not get a salary while the company's board investigates the bank's sales practices.The third largest U.S. bank will eliminate the goals by Oct. 1, earlier than its previous target of Jan. 1, 2017, according to the remarks, which were obtained by Reuters. Stumpf will appear before the House Financial Services Committee on Thursday.The San Francisco-based bank agreed to pay $190 million earlier this month to settle regulatory charges over the account scandal and has fired about 5,300 employees, most of them low-ranking staff, in connection with it. Carrie Tolstedt, the former head of the retail division at the center of the burgeoning sales scandal, will get no severance and forfeited unvested equity awards worth about $19 million, the bank said. Tolstedt left the company before her planned Dec. 31 retirement date. Stumpf and Tolstedt will also not receive bonuses for 2016.The penalties represent one of the biggest financial sanctions ever levied against a major bank boss and mark a sharp change from a few years ago when no CEO had to give back a bonus despite scandals at large banks. A special committee of the bank's independent directors will lead an investigation into the retail bank's sales practices, helped by the board’s human resources committee and law firm Shearman & Sterling LLP, according to the bank.""We are deeply concerned by these matters, and we are committed to ensuring that all aspects of the company’s business are conducted with integrity, transparency, and oversight,"" Stephen Sanger, the board's lead independent director, said. Stumpf, a member of the board, has recused himself from the investigation, the bank said.Wells Fargo stock added 0.2 percent to $45.19. Up to Tuesday's close, shares had fallen nearly 10 percent since Sept. 8, when it reached a settlement with regulators, wiping off about $24 billion of market capitalization.

681,"   By Olivia Oran and Ross Kerber | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Wells Fargo & Co's unprecedented move to strip Chief Executive John Stumpf of $41 million in stock awards has sent a chill through Wall Street with bankers fearful that a hardening political climate against corporate wrongdoing will encourage boards to be more aggressive about making them forfeit pay.A sales practices scandal at Wells Fargo, where some of its employees opened as many as 2 million accounts without customers' knowledge to hit sales targets, could not have come at a worse time for the wider industry with politicians in Washington reviewing new rules on bank executive remuneration.Bankers fear not only that the new rules on pay will be tightened as a result of the furor at Wells Fargo but also that boards will go beyond them to avoid a political backlash.""The Wells Fargo board made a mistake by not recouping some of the CEO's pay until after the firestorm developed,"" said Harvard Law School professor Jesse Fried. ""Other boards will learn from this mistake."" U.S. regulators are looking at requiring banks to defer compensation for senior officials and to allow clawbacks for misdeeds over the previous seven years. The law is meant to come into effect in 2019 and regulators are trying to get it finalized before a new president takes office in January.But banks' legal advisers worry that the Wells Fargo scandal will result in them putting stiffer, more concrete requirements into their proposal, such as requiring banks to decide very quickly - perhaps in as little as 30 days - on clawing back compensation once misconduct has been discovered, according to the general counsel of a large Wall Street bank, who spoke on condition of anonymity.Banks are increasingly in Washington's crosshairs with U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen telling a congressional committee on Wednesday that the central bank is considering changes to its annual stress test of the sector that would result in a significant increase in their overall capital requirements.Yellen also told the committee that the Fed was reviewing whether the largest U.S. lenders are complying with banking rules in the wake of what happened at Wells Fargo.The Comptroller of the Currency Thomas Curry said in his testimony before the U.S. Senate last week that the behavior at Wells Fargo highlights the need to complete the compensation rule. POLITICALLY ATTRACTIVE Clawback provisions were put in place or strengthened at all the top U.S. banks after the financial crisis of 2008, primarily to hold executives responsible for risk taking. But the time period to claw back is often around three years, less than half the current proposal of seven years, and the proposed regulation would expand the pool of employees subject to it. Britain introduced laws last year that allow banks to seek recovery of bonuses from bankers deemed to have acted irresponsibly up to 10 years after they are paid out.Standard Chartered Plc has said it will try to claw back bonuses from up to 150 senior staff if they are found culpable of breaching internal rules around risk-taking during the tenure of former chief executive Peter Sands.But clawing back money from people who have already left a bank can be fraught with practical and legal difficulties. Stumpf is the first CEO of a major U.S. bank to actually have to give back significant pay or benefits as the result of a scandal. Wells Fargo's rule is written broadly enough that Stumpf was subject to a clawback even though the bank's $185 million fine did not force it to make a material restatement of its results.The rules vary from bank to bank, but they generally allow the banks to take back stock awards or pay for misconduct, taking improper risks or poor performance. Executives can also be penalized if the bank has to significantly restate results. Compensation consultants said that increased clawbacks could make it more difficult for banks to recruit and keep top talent with bonuses at investment and commercial banks down about 40 percent since the financial crisis.""Compensation is going to be a much more political process going forward. You're going to based not only on your merits but what is politically attractive at the moment,"" said Alan Johnson, managing director of compensation consulting firm Johnson Associates.He said the Wells Fargo scandal will have blunted industry efforts to soften the impending remuneration rules.""Whatever progress had been made in lobbying some features now has been set back to zero,"" he said. ""Who is going to listen to the banking industry now?"" Still, David Knutson, head of credit research in the Americas for Schroder Investment Management, believes CEOs at other banks will be more careful with their own businesses now that they have seen what happened to Stumpf. ""When you see a colleague you've known for years all of a sudden lose $40 million, it makes you more cautious,"" he said.  (Additional reporting by David Henry in New York and Lawrence White and Kirstin Ridley in London; Writing by Michael Erman; Editing by Carmel Crimmins and Bill Rigby)",2016-09-28,WFC,"Wed Sep 28, 2016 | 7:19pm EDT",Wells Fargo's CEO pay clawback puts Wall Street executives on notice,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-wells-fargo-accounts-clawbacks-idUSKCN11Y358?type=companyNews

688,"   By Olivia Oran  In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, the banking industry sought to address an ethics crisis with surveys, town hall meetings, appointments of overseers and mechanisms for employees to report malfeasance.Now, the high-pressure sales scandal at Wells Fargo & Co  provides more evidence that large U.S. banks may have little to show for the effort.Bank consultants say tens of millions of dollars are spent each year on initiatives to build a culture of integrity, partly at the urging of regulators such as the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.Octavio Marenzi, co-founder of Opimas, a management consultant that focuses on the finance industry, said banks have spent a lot of money researching their culture and updating ethics handbooks - with little impact.""A lot of what the banks are doing are superficial attempts,"" said Marenzi. ""It's more window-dressing than anything else.""The continuing spate of scandals reinforces doubts about the effectiveness of such efforts. Wells Fargo's debacle - involving the creation of as many as 2 million accounts without customers' permission - is only the latest black eye for bankers.Other recent lapses have included widespread rigging of benchmark interest rates by traders at several banks; reports that JPMorgan Chase & Co hired children of high-ranking Chinese officials to curry favor; and allegations in a London court that Goldman Sachs Group Inc bankers hired prostitutes for officials at Libya's sovereign wealth fund to win business.Wells has also previously faced accusations of discriminatory mortgage lending practices from local and federal authorities. Wells, which has denied the accusations, reached a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice in 2012.A FEW BAD APPLES? Earlier this month, Wells reached a $185 million settlement with the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Los Angeles City Attorney over abusive sales tactics involved in the creation of bogus customer accounts.In a statement, Wells Fargo spokesman Mark Folk said the bank takes responsibility for customers receiving products they did not request.""Wells Fargo's culture is committed to the best interests of our customers, providing them with only the products they want and value,"" Folk wrote. Workers have described a pressure-cooker atmosphere where they risked losing their jobs if they did not hit unrealistic sales targets. They say this pressure defined working for Wells Fargo and directly led to widespread fraud in the opening of bogus accounts.Wells Fargo officials have countered that problems were isolated to a relatively small number of workers.Lawmakers who questioned Wells Fargo Chief Executive John Stumpf at a heated Senate Banking Committee hearing last week were unmoved by this explanation, particularly in light of the bank's firing of 5,300 workers over what it described as improper sales.""Is it normal for 1 percent of a business unit to be fired over fraud?"" Republican Sen. David Vitter asked.Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley later asked a panel of government officials who regulate Wells Fargo or were involved in the settlement why Stumpf attributed the problem to rogue individuals rather than a pervasive culture or structural incentives installed by bank executives.""It's inconsistent with our findings,"" responded Thomas Curry, U.S. comptroller of the currency.On Tuesday evening, independent directors on the bank's board said they would pursue their own investigation and claw back $41 million worth of previously granted stock awards from Chairman and Chief Executive John Stumpf, who would also forego his salary as the directors' probe continued. In a statement, Lead Independent Director Stephen Sanger said directors would ""take all appropriate actions to reinforce the right culture and ensure that lessons are learned, misconduct is addressed, and systems and processes are improved.""REDOUBLED EFFORTS Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman has said that a creating a culture of integrity is among his top priorities. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in the bank's 2014 annual report that his firm needed to ""redouble"" efforts to reform its culture after making ""a number of mistakes - some of them quite painful and costly - over the last several years.""The mistakes included a $13 billion deal with the U.S. government to settle allegations of overstating the quality of bad mortgages to investors. Since then, JPMorgan launched an examination of its culture that included interviews between senior executives and over 16,000 employees.Citigroup Inc also recently launched an internal video series in which senior executives discuss how they handled business decisions in grey areas of ethics. The bank also lets employees know when colleagues are dismissed for inappropriate conduct, such as in 2014 when it dismissed 12 employees after finding fraudulent loans in Mexico. This was communicated to the firm in a memo from CEO Michael Corbat.For the first time this year, Morgan Stanley will ask risk and compliance officers to evaluate so-called ""material risk-takers,"" such as bankers and traders. This feedback will play a factor in promotion and compensation decisions.European bank executives are also focused on promoting a culture of honesty. Deutsche Bank AG CEO John Cryan has spoken publicly about the German lender's need to change, while former Barclays PLC CEO Antony Jenkins was so focused on improving the British bank's culture that some employees dubbed him St. Antony.The banks declined to comment for this story.MEASURING CHANGE As they have embarked on these cultural-change campaigns, banks have struggled with how to measure progress. Bankers who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity mostly acknowledged their institutions have more work to do.Some have started running employee opinion surveys with questions such as, ""What makes you proud to come to work?"" and ""What impedes the way you do business?"" Personality tests can also examine how employees think about risk and how their personal values affect business decisions, said Ernst and Young's Clive Martin, who works with banks on culture issues.Banks are also looking for signs that an employee might engage in bad behavior. For example, if a trader who frequently hits risk limits, misses compliance training, or doesn't take a mandatory two week holiday that is imposed to catch fraud, it could be a red flag, consultants and bank lawyers say.The New York Fed, which has held symposiums on changing the culture of Wall Street, has suggested creating a database of bank employees who were dismissed for bad behavior.Even with all these methods and tactics, some experts see little fundamental improvement.""You can tell banks to be good, and the Fed tries hard - it holds gatherings and seminars, gets us academics in and we talk about stuff,"" said Shivaram Rajgopal, a professor at Columbia Business School who has researched corporate culture. ""The less cynical perspective is, maybe it's hard to move the needle.""",2016-09-28,WFC,"Wed Sep 28, 2016 | 3:01pm EDT",Wells Fargo scandal reignites debate about big bank culture,http://www.reuters.com//article/wells-fargo-accounts-culture-idUSL2N1C41XZ?type=companyNews

""This Deutsche Bank story is really casting a very long shadow over equity markets,"" said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group, in New York.

703,"   By Patrick Rucker and Dan Freed | WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  WASHINGTON/NEW YORK U.S. lawmakers called on Thursday for Wells Fargo & Co chief John Stumpf to resign and a top House Democrat demanded the bank be broken up because it is too big to manage.Stumpf's second trip to Capitol Hill on Thursday went no better than his first as lawmakers from both parties rebuked his handling of sales abuses and said the bank had damaged customer trust as well as the broader banking system.Wells Fargo staff opened checking, savings and credit card accounts without customer say-so for years to satisfy managers' demand for new business, according to a $190 million settlement with regulators reached early this month.U.S. Representative Maxine Waters, the committee's senior Democrat, faulted the bank for identity theft in the fraud and called for Wells Fargo to be dismantled because it was too big to manage. She called the sales abuses ""some of the most egregious fraud we have seen since the foreclosure crisis."" After the hearing, the California lawmaker told reporters she would introduce legislation to break up Wells Fargo.The bank has said as many as 2 million accounts may have been wrongly opened and Stumpf promised to undo any harm to customers.The chief executive said, however, that Wells Fargo did not expect to see disgruntled bank customers in court.Wells Fargo is offering arbitration for its unhappy clients, Stumpf said. Pushed about whether he would waive that mandatory arbitration rule and allow customers to sue, Stumpf said: ""No."" Members of the House Financial Services Committee blasted Stumpf over the bank's culture, his compensation and whether the right people were being punished for opening fee-generating, phantom accounts.The episode has been a stunning reversal for Stumpf, long regarded as a safe pair of hands in the industry for navigating Wells Fargo successfully through the financial crisis. Stumpf again heard lawmakers calling for him to step aside. Jeb Hensarling, the Republican chairman of the committee, said in his opening statement he had lost faith in Wells Fargo, which does some of his banking.  ""Mr. Stumpf, I have a mortgage with your bank,"" Hensarling said. ""I wish I didn’t. I wish I was in the position to pay it off because you have broken my trust as you have broken the trust of millions.""Wells Fargo shares fell 2.07 percent to $44.37. Since Sept. 7, the last trading day before the scandal broke, its stock has lost 11 percent, or about $27 billion in market value, based on Reuters data. The stock is trading at its lowest since early 2014.BROKEN TRUST  Republicans on the committee have often advocated easing Wall Street regulations, but they were among Stumpf's strongest critics at Thursday's hearing.Asked by Representative Sean Duffy, a Republican from Wisconsin, about whether Wells Fargo employees 'stole,' Stumpf said: ""In some cases, they did.""""I am deeply sorry that we didn't do the right thing,"" Stumpf said in response to a lawmaker who said the scandal had eroded the bank's market value.Representative Steve Pearce, a Republican from New Mexico, faulted Stumpf for saying the company's board could eventually be relied on to sanction the executives responsible.""I, sir, think you ought to submit a resignation and your board cannot hold off action on that,"" he said.  Representative Brad Sherman, a Democrat from California, asked the committee to summon other Wall Street chiefs, including from Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Corp, to determine if they had imposed sales demands and quotas on their employees.""I don't think, Mr. Stumpf, that you should be alone in this joyous experience,"" Sherman said.Stumpf said the bank was strengthening oversight of sales tactics, changing procedures for issuing credit cards and had paid back past and current customers for any fees incurrent on the ghost accounts.Earlier this week, the bank took back $41 million in stock awarded to Stumpf, an unprecedented rebuke to a major U.S. bank chief executive officer.Democratic Representative Carolyn Maloney of New York raised questions about $13 million in stock sales by the CEO in 2013 after he learned about the abuses. Stumpf said he sold stock with proper approvals and added the sales were made ""with no view about what was going on."" The affair has triggered lawsuits, more investigations and wiped more than $20 billion from the bank's market value.While Wells Fargo may be shielded from some customer actions, the bank may just be starting to face heightened regulatory scrutiny.On Thursday, the bank agreed to pay the Justice Department $4.1 million to resolve allegations it illegally repossessed cars owned by U.S. service members. In a separate settlement of similar allegations, the bank will pay a $20 million settlement with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

706,"   By Amanda Becker | TOLEDO, Ohio  TOLEDO, Ohio Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Monday vowed to hold Wells Fargo accountable for ""egregious corporate behavior"" in a scandal over employees' opening millions of accounts without customers' knowledge.""Really shocking isn't it? One of the nations' biggest banks bullying thousands of employees into committing fraud against unsuspecting customers,"" Clinton told a crowd in Ohio, a crucial battleground in the Nov. 8 presidential election against Republican Donald Trump. In Toledo, an area that has lost manufacturing jobs, Clinton said she wanted to ""send a clear message to every boardroom and executive suite"" that they companies will be held accountable if they ""scam"" customers, ""exploit"" employees and ""rip off"" tax payers. ""To understand why this is so important, consider the recent examples we’ve seen of egregious corporate behavior,"" she said, citing Wells Fargo.   Ahead of Clinton's speech, her campaign released a plan to help consumers to sue corporations in court instead of being forced to take disputes to private arbitration. Mandatory arbitration clauses make class action suits difficult or impossible to bring.  Clinton said the Wells Fargo (WFC.N) case shed light on how such agreements harm consumers.""We are not going to let companies like Wells Fargo use these fine print gotchas to escape accountability,"" Clinton added.    Consumer advocates say mandatory individual arbitration makes it prohibitively expensive to take legal action and does not set a legal precedent to help other affected individuals. Wells Fargo has come under fire for using arbitration clauses after it came to light that the bank’s employees opened as many as 2 million checking, savings and credit card accounts without the customers' permission in order to meet sales quotas. Wells Fargo reached a $190 million settlement with federal regulators last month. Its customers have been unable to sue because their contracts said they would arbitrate disputes instead of suing Wells Fargo in court.Wells Fargo Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf recently said he did not expect the bank to waive the clauses. Democratic lawmakers in Congress, including Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have called on Wells Fargo to allow customers to sue. ""They are forced into a closed-door arbitration process without the important protections you get in a court of law,"" Clinton said.Clinton's plan calls on Congress to give agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission, Federal Communications Commission and Department of Labor the authority to restrict arbitration clauses in consumer, employment and antitrust agreements.(In first paragraph, inserts dropped apostrophe after employees.

710,"   By Ernest Scheyder | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Oct 3 Chevron Corp on Monday said it stands behind John Stumpf, a member of its board and the chief executive of bank Wells Fargo & Co, despite growing concerns about his leadership during a customer service scandal.Pressure has mounted on Stumpf in recent days to resign as CEO of Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. bank by deposits, after revelations the bank for years opened checking, savings and credit card accounts without customer approval to satisfy managers' demands for new business.Lawmakers of both major U.S. political parties in Congress have excoriated Stumpf, accusing him of creating a culture in which such a practice could thrive. Earlier this month Stumpf resigned from an advisory role at the U.S. Federal Reserve.Chevron executives had cited his experience and reputation as a major benefit to its shareholders when recommending him to the board. The company's board also noted his position at the Fed when it nominated him to the board. ""John (Stumpf) is a valued member of our board,"" Chevron spokesman Kent Robertson said in an emailed statement to Reuters. ""Given the investigations that are underway, it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.""Stumpf joined the Chevron board in 2010, the same year he became chairman of the San Francisco-based bank and three years after he became its CEO.

711,"   By Amanda Becker | WHITE PLAINS, N.Y.  WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. Oct 3 U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Monday will unveil a plan to make it easier for consumers to take legal action against ""bad corporate actors,"" citing Wells Fargo & Co and Mylan Pharmaceuticals, according to a campaign official.While campaigning in Ohio, the Democratic nominee will explain how she would, if elected on Nov. 8, curb the prevalence of contractual clauses that require consumers, employees and other individuals to resolve legal disputes in private arbitration proceedings instead of in courts, her campaign said.Mandatory arbitration clauses sometimes require that claims be pursued on an individual basis instead of on behalf of a class of similarly situated individuals. Consumer advocates say this makes it prohibitively expensive to take legal action. Clinton will call on the U.S. Congress to give agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Labor the authority to restrict the use of arbitration clauses in consumer, employment and antitrust agreements, according to a preliminary plan reviewed by Reuters.Clinton will also discuss how she believes that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other agencies already have the authority to curb the use of such clauses under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. The planning document said she would urge the Securities and Exchange Commission to exercise its authority to make related rules authorized by the financial reform law. Wells Fargo is expected to be in the crosshairs when Clinton discusses how she would curb mandatory arbitration clauses.For years, the bank's employees opened as many as 2 million checking, savings and credit card accounts without the customers' permission in order to meet sales quotas. Wells Fargo reached a $190 million settlement with federal regulators earlier this month. When Wells Fargo chief John Stumpf testified before Congress recently about the unauthorized accounts, he said he did not expect the bank to waive a clause signed by its customers in order to open their authorized accounts. The clause said they would arbitrate disputes instead of suing Wells Fargo in court.Democratic lawmakers in Congress, including Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have called on Wells Fargo to toss out the mandatory arbitration clause and allow customers to sue.Clinton is also expected to criticize Mylan for sharply raising without justification the price of EpiPens, which deliver life-saving drugs to those with allergies. The criticism will be part of a larger push to curb excessive market concentration and encourage competition that benefits consumers, her campaign said.

712,"  (Adds detail throughout)By Dan FreedOct 4 Fitch Ratings cut the outlook to ""negative"" for Wells Fargo & Co's credit ratings on Tuesday, citing troubles the bank is facing from opening unauthorized customer accounts.Although the credit-rating firm cut Wells' outlook from ""stable,"" it affirmed the bank's existing rating of AA-, which is investment-grade.In an announcement, Fitch cited ""potential reputational damage from the recent regulatory actions and fines,"" as well as a belief that Wells could face ""earnings pressure."" A Wells Fargo spokesman declined to comment on the Fitch announcement.Wells Fargo last month reached a $185 million settlement with a federal consumer regulator and Los Angeles prosecutor over opening as many as 2 million accounts for retail customers without their permission. Two congressional hearings and several other investigations have followed, and Wells shares have lost more than 12 percent of their value. Though Wells Fargo has been downgraded by at least one stock analyst, Fitch's outlook change is the most significant credit ratings impact since the scandal erupted.Both Fitch and Moody's Investors Service had earlier said the sham accounts were ""credit negative"" for Wells Fargo, but had not changed their ratings or outlook. Investors have not shown much worry about the impact on Wells Fargo's ability to meet its debt obligations.The price of insuring $10 million worth of Wells Fargo debt maturing in five years was unchanged on Tuesday at $64,000 per year following the Fitch announcement, according to credit default swaps (CDS) prices from Markit, the financial information services company. That compares to $67,000 for JPMorgan Chase & Co and $85,000 for Bank of America Corp .On Sept. 7, that same insurance cost $48,000 for Wells Fargo, $58,000 for JPMorgan and $75,000 for Bank of America.Wells Fargo shares fell 0.2 percent on Tuesday to close at $43.75.

714,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Wells Fargo & Company's  (WFC) ratings at 'AA-/F1+' and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.'s ratings at 'AA/F1+'. The  Rating Outlook is revised to Negative from Stable.  The affirmation reflects the company's superior earnings profile, strong  liquidity, and still benign asset quality, while the Outlook revision reflects  potential damage to the firm's franchise and earnings profile following recent  regulatory actions regarding improper unauthorized account openings.  The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One Finance Corporation (COF),  Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (CFG), Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third  Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank  Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holding Corporation (MUAH), PNC Financial  Services Group (PNC), Regions Financial Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc.  (STI), US Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation  (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRs, VRs, AND SENIOR DEBT The affirmation reflects the company's superior earnings profile, strong  liquidity, and still benign asset quality. Fitch has revised the Outlook to  Negative given the uncertain impact to WFC's franchise resulting from the  potential reputational damage from the recent regulatory actions and fines  related to its sales practices in its Community Banking business line. In  particular, Fitch believes that the firm could face earnings pressure as a  result, with earnings being a significant competitive strength for WFC.  The recent $185 million fine levied on WFC for improper sales practices dating  back to 2011 was fully accrued for and represents just a fraction of WFC's  quarterly earnings of approximately $5.5 billion. Customer damages appear  limited, with $2.6 million refunded and with WFC earmarking up to $5 million to  cover this and any additional required customer remediation. However, Fitch  views the ensuing reputational damage, risk oversight failures, impact to its  selling practices, and the resulting effect on earnings as much larger issues  than the actual fine. While this issue is not new, as it was first reported by the media in 2013 and  the Los Angeles city attorney filed suit in May 2015, the breadth of the issue  is surprising. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Consent Order  disclosed that WFC opened up more than 1.5 million deposit accounts and over  500,000 credit card accounts that may not have been authorized. Further, this  appears to be a significant breakdown in what Fitch has long viewed as a solid  risk management infrastructure.  WFC's earnings profile has been superior to peers, in part due to its  cross-selling culture. WFC recently disclosed that the company would eliminate  all product sales goals in retail banking effective Oct. 1, 2016. This change  may impact the company's revenue streams in the future. While WFC emerged from  the financial crisis in a much better position than similarly sized peers, Fitch  believes this issue creates reputational risk given the issue and allegations  are understandable to the general public, in a way that misdeeds at other banks  are not.  There is also an outstanding lawsuit filed by the city of Miami against WFC and  Bank of America for alleged predatory lending. The U.S. Supreme Court will rule  whether the city of Miami is allowed to bring the lawsuits in 2017. Fitch also  expects further lawsuits and investigations related to the sales practices. A  class action lawsuit has been filed in Utah. Adverse outcomes on these issues  could further impair WFC's reputation.  Fitch has viewed WFC's management team and risk management culture favorably.  There has been a great deal of stability in the executive management ranks, with  little turnover. However, this does represent a significant breakdown in the  risk management infrastructure and oversight. Carrie Tolstedt announced her  retirement in mid-July 2016. She formerly ran the Community Banking business  line, which included the branch network. It is unclear whether there will be  further executive management departures. However, Fitch expects the situation to  be somewhat fluid, garnering a great deal of regulatory, political, and  potential legal attention over the near term.  Providing support to the ratings and underpinning today's rating affirmation,  WFC's financial performance has been solid over the past several years despite a  challenging economic and interest rate environment. While current earnings are  below pre-crisis levels, they exceed large regional bank peer medians and are in  line with Fitch's expectations. WFC's superior earnings performance and capital  generation capabilities are core strengths for the company and positive rating  drivers that differentiate it from its peers. Fitch attributes WFC's superior earnings profile to its low funding costs,  efficient cost structure, and a diversified business model by geography and  product type that has proven resilient over time. Further, Fitch assumes that  WFC has been able to benefit post-financial crisis from a flight to quality.  It is hard to discern how much of WFC's strong sales culture also contributed to  its earnings profile, but Fitch acknowledges that the bank was at the forefront  of recognizing the profitability of customers who have multiple products with a  bank and hence was an early and strong advocate of cross-selling. Other banks'  incentive practices may have also contributed to improper sales practices, and  there may be changes to compensation practices at other banks and/or regulatory  findings.  WFC's stated strategic objectives are clearly articulated, and achievable. The  company recently lowered its ROA and ROE targets to 1.1% to 1.4% and 11% to 14%,  respectively. These growth targets are intended to reflect the company's  performance over the next two years and are not long-term targets.  Fitch views the revision as expected given the challenging interest rate  environment, and lackluster economic growth. Fitch also believes the adjustment  is prudent and expects the company is not going to compromise its risk appetite  for short-term earnings.  WFC's franchise has been considered one of the strongest of all U.S. banks, with  leading market shares in many sectors and asset classes. WFC has the second most  deposits in the U.S., and over 90% of its deposits are in states where its  deposit market share is ranked first, second, or third.  WFC's capital profile is also considered solid, relative to its risk profile,  capital generation capabilities, and target payout ranges. The Common Equity  Tier 1 under Basel III Standardized Approach, fully phased-in, was 10.61% at  June 30, 2016, above the company's long-term target of 10%, which includes the  2% G-SIB capital surcharge. Fitch expects that WFC's long-term capital target  will be higher than many of its regional peers, which may manage to long-term  capital targets of between 8% and 9.5%. Over the near term, it is not  anticipated that WFC will be able to manage its capital down to 10% given  relatively sluggish economic growth. Over the past six months, WFC's CET1 has  only declined 16bps.  WFC's liquidity profile is considered the strongest of the large regional peer  group. Since 2005, WFC has reported the lowest cost of deposits and lowest cost  of total funding, on average, among its peer group. The proposed TLAC rule has a  relatively higher burden for WFC than some of its G-SIB peers, given the make-up  of WFC's existing balance sheet, which benefits much more from WFC's low-cost  deposit funding. As WFC issues more long-term debt in preparation, its  profitability will be impacted. Over the past six months, WFC issued $48 billion  in long-term debt, as compared to $14 billion during the same period last year.  In addition to proposed TLAC rules impacting the composition of the balance  sheet, the LCR has also contributed to a large increase in cash and short-term  investments. Together, these assets account for 17% of the balance sheet, up  from 11% at year-end 2012. WFC does not disclose its LCR, only that it exceeds  the requirement with an internal buffer. In terms of WFC's asset quality, WFC's NPA ratios remain elevated and above the  regional bank peer median. Much of the weaker relative performance is due to a  large balance of mortgage-related accruing TDRs, of which 86% are current.  Despite higher NPA levels, NCOs are roughly in line with peer averages. Fitch  expects loan losses will increase from currently unsustainably low levels for  WFC, as well as the industry, especially under a higher interest rate  environment. However, higher provisioning should not materially impact WFC's  financial profile given its earnings strength. Further, excluding GE-acquired  loans, total loan balances are up approximately 5% during the past 12 months,  suggesting WFC is not assuming outsized risk.  While WFC is still growing mortgage, automobile and credit card loans, a mix  shift is underway with a greater percentage of commercial loans than even just a  year ago. Period-end commercial loans accounted for 52% of total loans at June  30, 2016, up from 49% a year ago. Commercial loans tend to have a lower loss  rate than consumer loans. WFC's view of long-term losses has been reduced to  65bps from 75bps disclosed two years ago. The estimate on long-term losses  includes an average cycle of approximately nine to 10 years and a recession of  average severity, and the improvement reflects the aforementioned shift in the  loan portfolio, and credit quality improvement to date.  Although WFC is one of the largest participants in the energy-sector, overall  O&G funded loans represent less than 2% of total loans and around 12% of  tangible common equity. WFC was one of the first banks to materially increase  loan loss reserves for this sector. Fitch views this as prudent given a higher  relative balance of sub-investment grade credits and approximately half of loans  to businesses in the E&P sector. Reserves at quarter-end totaled $1.6 billion,  or roughly 3.4 times realized losses year-to-date. The ultimate future and direction of Wells Fargo Securities, WFC's trade name  for its capital markets and investment banking services, remain of interest to  Fitch. Although WFC continues to stress the customer-focused strategy and lack  of interest in acquisitions in this space, the bank has been growing in this  sector following some downsizing in 2008 and 2009 after the acquisition of  Wachovia. Fitch expects any expansion by WFC in capital markets to remain a  primarily customer-focused strategy, and for it to remain relatively small in  terms of the bank's total business mix. Investment banking revenues comprised  1.7% of revenues in 1H16, with trading gains, gains on debt securities, and  gains on equity investments contributing another 3.7% of revenues, a relatively  modest amount as compared to similarly-sized peers.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES WFC's subordinated debt is notched one level below its VR of 'a+' for loss  severity. WFC's preferred stock is notched five levels below its VR, two times  for loss severity and three times for non-performance, while WFC's trust  preferred securities are notched two times from the VR for loss severity and two  times for non-performance. These ratings are in accordance with Fitch's criteria  and assessment of the instruments non-performance and loss severity risk  profiles and have thus been affirmed due to the affirmation of the VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The uninsured deposit ratings of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank  Northwest are rated one notch higher than Wells Fargo Bank's IDR and senior  unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from depositor  preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities superior  recovery prospects in the event of default.  WFC's international subsidiary, Wells Fargo Bank International's deposit ratings  are at the same level as senior debt ratings because their preferential status  is less clear and disclosure concerning dually payable deposits makes it  difficult to determine if they are eligible for U.S. depositor preference. HOLDING COMPANY  WFC's VR is equalized with those of its operating companies and banks,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also  equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and  subsidiary failure and default probabilities.  SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY Wells Fargo Bank N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank Northwest N.A. are rated 'AA'. The  banks' ratings are one notch above the parent reflecting the expected  implementation of total loss absorbing capital (TLAC) requirements for U.S.  Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs) and the presence of a substantial  debt buffer in the holding company. The VRs remain equalized between WFC and its material operating subsidiaries.  The common VR of WFC and its operating companies reflects the correlated  performance, or failure rate between the WFC and these subsidiaries. Fitch takes  a group view on the credit profile from a failure perspective, while the IDR  reflects each entity's non-performance (default) risk on senior debt. Fitch  believes that the likelihood of failure is roughly equivalent, while the default  risk given at the operating company would be lower given TLAC. All U.S. bank  subsidiaries carry a common VR, regardless of size, as U.S. banks are  cross-guaranteed under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and  Enforcement Act (FIRREA).  Wells Fargo Canada Corp., Wells Fargo Bank International, and Wells Fargo  Securities International Limited are wholly owned subsidiaries of WFC or Wells  Fargo Bank, N.A. Their IDRs and debt ratings are aligned with WFC reflecting  Fitch's view that these entities are core and integral to WFC's business  strategy and operations. Their IDRs and ratings would be sensitive to the same  factors that might drive a change in WFC's IDR. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR WFC has a Support Rating (SR) of '5' and Support Rating Floor (SRF) of 'NF'. In  Fitch's view, the probability of support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not  incorporate any support.  Wells Fargo Bank International has a support rating of '1', which is an  institutional support rating, and indicates that there is a high probability  that WFC would provide support to Wells Fargo Bank International, which is  domiciled in Ireland.  RATING SENSITIVITIES VR, IDRs, AND SENIOR DEBT While it is difficult to quantify the potential reputational damage to the  company's franchise, Fitch will be monitoring whether notable deterioration is  observed in deposits, account openings, primary checking customers, or wealth  and investment management client assets. WFC's ratings could be impacted as the  strength of its franchise is an important rating driver. Further, outsized  earnings decline relative to peers may also point to an impact to the franchise  from recent events, which could also have negative rating implications.  Fitch expects any further fines or litigation costs will be manageable in the  context of the company's superior earnings profile. However, failure to maintain  earnings at above peer levels will pressure WFC's ratings, as its earning  profile is one of the key rating drivers. The strength of the earnings stream  provides for solid capital generation capabilities, which will help absorb  unexpected losses. WFC has already announced the elimination of product sales  goals in retail banking, effective Oct. 1, 2016. It is unclear what implications  a potentially cautious approach to sales throughout the organization may cause  for WFC's revenues.  WFC's ratings may also be impacted by an observable shift in its strategy to  higher-risk activities. Fitch is sensitive to a shift in the bank's risk  appetite given external earnings pressures stemming from the need to hold more  long-term debt for the proposed TLAC rule or from the need to hold higher  capital levels given its G-SIB surcharge.  If WFC were to meaningfully increase its capital markets activities to a size in  line with those of other large trading banks or be on a trajectory to do so,  there may be negative rating implications given the increased volatility and  risk associated with trading activities, although Fitch views this as unlikely  over the rating horizon. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings for WFC and its operating companies' subordinated debt, trust  preferred securities, and preferred stock are sensitive to any change to WFC's  VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The long- and short-term deposit ratings are sensitive to any change to WFC's  long- and short-term IDR.  HOLDING COMPANY  Should WFC's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company VR from the ratings of the operating companies.  SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY  The IDRs and ratings of Wells Fargo Canada Corp., Wells Fargo Bank  International, and Wells Fargo Securities International Limited are sensitive to  the same factors that might drive a change in WFC's IDR. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Since WFC's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively,  there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable  future.  Additionally, due to the linkage in ratings between WFC and Wells Fargo Bank  International, if Wells Fargo Bank International were to become less  strategically important to WFC, its ratings may be impacted.

Following the vote, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel told reporters: ""The city's disappointed in Wells Fargo.""Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner's office, which included Wells Fargo in a pool of senior underwriters for bond sales, said on Sunday the state would not be using the bank for debt deals ""until further notice.""Illinois Treasurer Michael Frerichs on Monday suspended $30 billion in state investment activity with the bank. Those activities include investments in Wells Fargo debt and bank broker/dealer services. Also on Wednesday, Connecticut's state treasurer Denise Nappier told Reuters in a statement that Morgan Stanley was added as a co-bookrunner for an October bond sale because of troubles at Wells Fargo.""The addition of Morgan Stanley ... was made in an abundance of caution to help ensure the success of the sale,"" the statement said. ""Wells Fargo had been assigned as the sole bookrunner prior to the recent revelations of regulatory actions against the bank.""In addition to outright sanctions, the states of Massachusetts and Oregon, as well as the city of New York, have  said they would press for reforms at the bank, await results of investigations while also reviewing their business relationship with the firm.

727,"   By Antony Currie | NEW YORK  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Wells Fargo is circling the stagecoaches around Chief Executive John Stumpf's top deputy. The $1.9 trillion lender just handed more power to President and Chief Operating Officer Tim Sloan, with three new senior executives and an expanded financial-technology group reporting to him. That ostensibly puts Sloan in even better position to succeed his boss. It's not clear, however, why a man so closely linked to the fake-accounts scandal should be CEO.Sloan has been a member of Wells Fargo's operating committee for most of this decade, including when the bank started to fire 5,300 people for their roles in opening some 2 million bogus bank and credit-card accounts. His involvement might have been somewhat excused had he stayed head of commercial or wholesale banking, where he spent most of his career. As chief administrative officer between 2010 and 2011, however, Sloan's role included overseeing Wells Fargo's human resources and reputation management. He then became finance chief for three years. And one of his direct reports when he was promoted to COO last year was Carrie Tolstedt, who ran the offending community-banking division until earlier this year.That makes Sloan a member of the inner circle that would have known about the wrongdoing from its early days and tried to deal with it. This group hardly covered itself in glory: it was still handing out pink slips in 2016, five years after the first bankers were shown the door. Stumpf and Tolstedt already have ceded compensation for the mess. Internal probes by the board and regulators may yet implicate Sloan and others. Stumpf has no more than two years left at the helm, based on the company's retirement-age rules. If after all the dust settles on the rot at Wells Fargo it sticks with its internal heir apparent, the bank will have to make the case for him.

736,"   By Dan Freed and E. Scott Reckard  Embroiled in a scandal over unauthorized customer accounts, Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) faces a steep challenge in overhauling its hard-charging sales culture without gutting profits.Until recently, Wells staffers labored under ambitious quotas while executives boasted to Wall Street about “cross-selling” each customer multiple accounts.That system collapsed with revelations that thousands of employees opened as many as 2 million accounts without customer permission, leading to a $185 million fine in September. But the problems ahead extend far beyond regulatory penalties, investigations and lawsuits.Executives will have to dismantle and rebuild systems of sales incentives and performance management that date back two decades, said retail banking experts, including two consultants who have worked for Wells Fargo. That will require heavy spending on hiring, training and installing safeguards against abuses.""They have to retrain their entire sales culture going back years,"" said Paul Miller, an analyst at FBR Capital markets. ""It's a huge job.""Wells Fargo spokesman Oscar Suris declined to comment for this story. On Monday, bank CEO John Stumpf and President Tim Sloan led a conference call with 500 executives to lay out responses to the scandal, including the addition of 2,000 risk management employees and a series of branch tours by the new head of retail banking, according to the Wall Street Journal. Management said the bank had lost some retail banking business and could lose more. “It’s going to be harder for awhile, and we get that,"" Sloan said, according to the Journal.   Dan Kleinman - a San Francisco-based consultant who has worked with Wells Fargo on and off since the 1970s - predicted it would take the bank 3-5 years to rebuild its sales and management structures, which he called a ""Herculean task.”Retraining could involve as many as 100,000 staffers at more than 6,000 locations. Some other potential costs are less obvious, such as recruiting and retaining the necessary talent. ""The question is whether the type of folks you want as employees will even work for the bank,"" Kleinman said. ""Its reputation is soiled.”SLASHED PROFIT FORECASTS  Most stock analysts covering Wells Fargo have cut profit forecasts, citing fallout from the scandal. Fitch Ratings also cut the bank's credit rating outlook to ""negative,"" citing potential profit erosion.The bank ditched its sales quotas on Oct. 1, amid political pressure. Stumpf has said he still ""loves"" cross-selling, but he used the word sparingly while fielding withering questions from the Senate Banking Committee. Stumpf explained that it was “shorthand for deepening relationships.""Some industry experts agree that the bank’s failures stem more from poor management than from the mere idea of selling customers multiple accounts, which isn’t unique to Wells.Citigroup Inc (C.N) predecessor Citicorp was one of the first companies to encourage cross-selling in banking in the late 1970s under former CEO Walter Wriston, according to financial journalist and author Philip Zweig, whose biography of Wriston was published in 1996.""There's nothing inherently wrong with cross-selling,"" Zweig said. ""The Wells Fargo scandal is the result of greed, perverse incentives, lack of controls ... and just plain bad management.""SHORT-SIGHTED STRATEGY  Wells Fargo embraced cross-selling about two decades ago, as “supermarket” banking gained popularity as a business model. By 1999, Wells Fargo's annual report referred to ""stores"" rather than ""branches.""Kleinman, a sales compensation expert who worked at Wells Fargo in the 1970s and 1980s, saw the shift in corporate culture taking hold by 2003, when he returned as a consultant.Retail operations were headed at the time by Stumpf, then executive vice president of community banking, and Carrie Tolstedt, then regional banking executive vice president. Kleinman recalled being summoned to a big meeting with large audio-visual displays on sales strategy. “I walked into basically a corporate sales event, pumping people up, very different than the culture I had seen before,” he said.Now Stumpf is battling to survive as CEO. Tolstedt retired as head of community banking in July amid investigations into the bank’s high-pressure sale culture. Her $125 million severance package has since sparked widespread criticism. The two executives forfeited $41 million and $19 million in unvested stock, respectively, in response to the blowback.Michael Moebs - a Wells Fargo executive in the 1970s and later a consultant to the bank for two decades - said the bank’s quota system would have been more appropriate for selling cars than car loans. Because retail banks sell ongoing services, measuring long-term customer service and satisfaction is far more important than short-term sales figures, said Moebs, now a banking consultant based in Lake Bluff, Ill.  “You're not just selling a product, but establishing a relationship,"" he said.A CRUCIAL ‘PIVOT’ Since Wells agreed to a regulatory settlement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Sept. 8, executives have denied that the bank's sales quotas and culture caused the widespread abuses. Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry has said Wells Fargo's customers were still happy and its employees were productive.""I think we can make this pivot in a way that protects our business model,"" he said at an investor conference last month. Wells has tried before to curtail gaming of sales quotas. In 2014, the bank monitored certain statistics as indicators of unauthorized account openings, one former Los Angeles-area branch manager told Reuters.In a “quality sales report card,” the bank set limits on the number of accounts that went unused - but the limits were so high as to undercut any serious reform, said the former manager, who declined to be identified because he now works for a Wells competitor. The bank directed managers, for instance, to ensure that no more than 45 percent of debit cards went without activation, and no more than 27.5 percent of new accounts went unfunded, the former manager said. The ""report cards"" were also cited in a 2015 federal lawsuit filed in San Francisco by employees alleging unauthorized account openings.Suris, the Wells Fargo spokesman, declined to comment on the bank's efforts to track unused accounts.Moebs, the consultant, said any effective reform effort would include more sophisticated employee incentives, such as bonuses that vest over several years with sustained growth in sales and customer satisfaction.The cost of such efforts would cut into short-term profits, he said, but with the ultimate payoff of customer and employee loyalty.""Like the rebuilding of any sports team,” Moebs said, “it takes time, money and talent.""

737,"   By Sarah N. Lynch | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Former Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) general manager Claudia Ponce de Leon filed a whistleblower complaint in December 2011 with federal labor regulators, alleging she was fired for telling superiors about employees opening unauthorized accounts. Nearly five years later, she has not been interviewed by investigators at the Labor Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), said her attorney Yosef Peretz.Her complaint claiming retaliation by Wells Fargo for reporting potential misconduct is one of several dozens filed against the bank over the last 14 years, Reuters has found.Their existence shows U.S. government regulators are still not meeting targets set by law -- a problem that was also flagged in a critical internal report issued in September 2015.As of Oct. 6, the agency had yet to close out 34 of the 91 complaints it has received since fiscal year 2002 from Wells Fargo employees alleging they faced retaliation after reporting potential wrongdoing, according to department data obtained through a Reuters public records request.    The department did not disclose details of the claims or the dates they were filed, and it remained unclear how many were related to the ongoing scandal involving Wells staffers opening as many as 2 million accounts without customer permission. It is also unclear how those 91 complaints against Wells Fargo compares with other corporations. The bank last month agreed to pay $190 million in fines and customer restitution in a settlement with the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau and other regulators. In late September, Reuters identified Ponce de Leon and at least four other former Wells Fargo employees who reported to OSHA between 2009 and 2014 that they were fired for raising concerns about the opening of unauthorized accounts and credit cards. Of the five OSHA complaints seen by Reuters, Ponce de Leon's case has been pending since December 2011, and another 2014 case was initially dismissed by an OSHA investigator on grounds that were later reversed on appeal by a Labor Department administrative law judge. The bank ultimately reached a settlement with the employee in 2015.The three other complaints - one in 2009 and two in 2010 - were transferred to state and federal courts, respectively. One employee of the Labor Department involved with the cases  has since filed his own whistleblower claim against the agency, alleging his office has a history of mishandling cases. His complaint does not reference the Wells Fargo complaints specifically. ""It's absolutely outrageous that whistleblowers contacted OSHA as early as 2009 about potential fraud at Wells Fargo, and yet these government bureaucrats failed to do their job,"" said    Sen. David Vitter, a Louisiana Republican who has been looking into how Wells Fargo's sales practices have impacted small business owners.   Labor Department Secretary Thomas Perez said last month that the department has launched a ""top-to-bottom"" review of prior Wells Fargo whistleblower complaints. Agency spokesman Jesse Lawder said it is the department's policy not to comment on specific whistleblower cases, but said the review aims to ""ensure whistleblowers receive the protections and remedies afforded them."" Richele Messick, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, could not comment on individual cases, but said the bank ""does not tolerate retaliation against team members who report their concerns and will take measures to protect team members from retaliation."" From fiscal year 2005 through 2015, less than two percent of all whistleblower complaints filed with OSHA were won on the merits, federal statistics show. The rest were either settled, dismissed or transferred to federal courts.    Lawyers who represent whistleblowers say OSHA investigators face challenges. One  problem is the ""crushing case load,"" which can lead to significant delays, said attorney Jason Zuckerman.OSHA, which received 3,288 whistleblower cases in fiscal year 2015, currently has 88 full-time investigators across the country in 10 regional offices.INTERNAL CRITICISM OSHA refers whistleblower complaints to the relevant federal regulators to investigate. But the office does not always refer them promptly, or sometimes at all, the Labor Department's inspector general found last year. An earlier audit in September 2010 found that 80 percent of complaints it reviewed were not properly investigated, meaning OSHA staff did not take steps such as interviewing the employee, obtaining a witness list or allowing the employee to refute the employer's defense.    The subsequent audit in September 2015 noted improvements, finding that 18 percent of complaints reviewed failed to meet certain investigative criteria.    Still, it also found that 72 percent of all of OSHA's investigations were not performed within the 30, 60 or 90-day time frames specified by various whistleblower protection laws. OSHA disputed some of those findings at the time, saying the audit relied on ""inaccurate data"" to determine how well it referred cases to other regulators.Labor Department spokeswoman Amanda McClure said OSHA's practice is to send copies of complaints when it receives them and its findings at the conclusion of the investigation to either the Securities and Exchange Commission or the CFPB, depending on which federal whistleblower law applies.It is not clear whether OSHA, which received complaints of the unauthorized account openings at Wells Fargo dating at least as far as 2009, referred the matters to federal banking regulators, such as the CFPB and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The CFPB, a new agency launched in July 2011, has said it did not start investigating the issue until it received tips from whistleblowers in mid-2013.   The OCC has said it first learned about the issues after it  received a ""small number"" of complaints from consumers and bank employees in March 2012. Those complaints and media reports in December 2013 led the regulator to step up its supervision of Wells Fargo. An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment on whether OSHA had referred the complaints about Wells Fargo's sales practices.     A CFPB spokesman declined to comment on whether the office had received any OSHA referrals involving Wells sales abuses.SITTING IN A STACK OF FILES Darrell Whitman - a former OSHA investigator in the San Francisco office from 2010-2015 - was assigned to three of the five cases examined by Reuters from former Wells Fargo employees alleging retaliation for reporting improper sales tactics.    Whitman said he only briefly dealt with Ponce de Leon's 2011 case before it was transferred to another investigator, and he was instructed to close the two 2010 cases because they were slated to be transferred to a federal court. Another investigator assigned at one point to Ponce de Leon's case, Susan Kamlet, told Reuters the case sat in a stack of other files and that her manager controlled which cases had priority.Now the former OSHA investigators are making their own claims of retaliation. Whitman alleges he was fired for raising concerns about the agency's mishandling of whistleblower complaints, and Kamlet says she was fired for supporting his accounts and for raising concerns about a particular case she was investigating.Whitman has since filed a whistleblower complaint of his own with the Office of Special Counsel, an office that investigates retaliation against federal employees. His complaint is still pending. The Labor Department spokeswoman and the Office of Special Counsel declined to comment. (Reporting by Sarah N.

740,"  (Recasts with share moves, comment)By Dan FreedThe Tim Sloan era has begun at Wells Fargo  but the old problems remain.The newly installed chief executive faces a plethora of challenges following a sales practices scandal that felled his predecessor John Stumpf.He needs to restore the bank's reputation after revelations that staff opened as many as two million accounts without customers' knowledge to meet internal sales goals and he has to navigate a litany of federal and state investigations arising from those revelations.Wall Street will be his first port of call when he presents  third-quarter results on Friday.Investors are seeking reassurance that a suddenly chastened Wells Fargo can rebuild its reputation and retain profits while overhauling the hard-charging sales culture at the heart of the scandal over unauthorized accounts.Sloan's nearly 30 years with Wells, largely spent on the corporate and institutional side of the bank, and his moderate temperament make him an experienced pair of hands.But as chief operating officer of the bank since November 2015, he had oversight over Wells' retail division where the unauthorized accounts were created, some of them during his tenure as COO.Such proximity will make it difficult to silence critics in Washington who are also investigating the scandal and have said it proves that some large banks should be broken up.""I remain concerned that incoming CEO Tim Sloan is also culpable in the recent scandal, serving in a central role in the chain of command that ought to have stopped this misconduct from happening,"" said Maxine Waters, the top Democrat of the House Financial Services Committee, in a statement. Wells' shares gave back the gains accrued on Wednesday in after-hours trading when Stumpf's departure was announced and were last down nearly two percent to $44.47. The stock is nearly 11 percent below the level it was trading at before the scandal broke.CALCULATING THE TAB Wall Street is trying to get a handle on what a long list of probes and lawsuits regarding the bank's opening of unauthorized customer accounts will ultimately cost.So far the tab has been relatively small: Wells agreed to a $190 million settlement last month, representing less than 1 percent of its annual earnings. But that deal itself led to a range of other inquiries the San Francisco-based bank is now contending with. Wells Fargo is expected to say how much money it has set aside for legal costs it can reasonably predict when management discusses results on Friday. At least nine separate regulators, prosecutors, enforcement agencies and congressional committees appear to be looking into the bank's actions, according to a Sept. 26 Bernstein Research report. That comes in addition to private lawsuits from shareholders, customers and former workers.Wells' settlement on Sept. 8 with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and a Los Angeles prosecutor revealed that the bank fired 5,300 employees for improper practices and is now working to retool risk-management protocol as well as pay incentives and training for workers.Former employees have described a pressure-cooker sales culture inside the bank where managers had browbeat staff into hitting aggressive daily sales quotas, which in turn led some workers to create unauthorized accounts.As government authorities examine Wells Fargo, it is likely they will find abuses in other parts of the bank beyond retail customers, said Harvey Pitt, founder of consulting firm Kalorama Partners and a former chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.""The damage to customers could be much more significant,"" said Pitt. Earlier this month, Reuters reported a probe by U.S. Senator David Vitter has found 10,000 small business customers were also victims of improper practices.A Wells Fargo spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.CUTTING FORECASTS It is difficult to estimate the total cost of the probes and litigation Wells will face over the unauthorized accounts, analysts said. Some matters could drag on for years before being resolved, and there are a range of possible outcomes.Even so, most analysts have cut profit forecasts for Wells Fargo, citing fallout from the scandal. The average estimate for Wells Fargo's 2017 net income is now $20.8 billion, down $300 million since Sept. 7, according to Thomson Reuters data.State and local municipalities including Illinois, California, Seattle and Chicago have publicly cut ties with Wells. While some analysts expect other government entities to make similar moves, the impact on Wells Fargo's revenues appears immaterial at this point.Less than 1 percent of Wells Fargo revenue comes from working with local governments, non-profit hospitals and universities, according to a presentation the bank made to investors earlier this year.The bank has also lost some retail customers, though Wells is still opening more accounts than it is closing, senior executives said on an internal call on Monday that was reported by the Wall Street Journal.(Additional reporting by Elizabeth Dilts)",2016-10-13,WFC,"Thu Oct 13, 2016 | 12:20pm EDT",Old problems overshadow new era at Wells Fargo,http://www.reuters.com//article/wells-fargo-accounts-idUSL1N1CJ190?type=companyNews

744,"   By Mary Kane  The Wells Fargo scandal over the bank’s opening fake credit card and bank accounts for unwitting customers continues to stoke populist outrage. There’s viral footage of Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts berating Wells Fargo chief executive and board chairman John Stumpf during a Senate hearing. He blamed $12-an-hour employees for the entire mess. Stumpf weathered another grilling, this one in the House of Representatives. But he abruptly resigned on Wednesday.Saturday Night Live pivoted off the scandal with a sly musical parody of the Broadway classic The Music Man. But the arriving Wells Fargo wagon that excited River City townspeople sing about in the SNL version is carrying financial instruments -- not musical ones for the new band. This Wells Fargo man is bringing bank accounts, credit cards and predatory loans.Federal regulators say Wells Fargo’s real life sales practices created a pressure-cooker bank culture in which employees strived to meet stiff quotas by opening phantom accounts for customers without first gaining their permission. Some customers only learned about their phony accounts when they were charged penalty fees or were contacted by debt collectors. In response, Wells fired 5,300 low-salaried workers, and the government slapped it with a record $185 million in fines.For some Americans, however, such shady financial practices aren’t that surprising. They seem all-too similar to the frustrations they face daily in trying to manage their money.This is the world of America’s unbanked and underbanked. The nearly 90 million people who have little or no connection to mainstream financial institutions and who often lack emergency savings and credit histories. Hidden fees, undisclosed loan terms and unexpected charges are standard features of their financial lives.Wells’ misdeeds, which so angered Congress, pale in comparison to the predatory nature of the financial services many working-class borrowers must rely on, including installment loans with 300 percent interest rates or quick cash tied to a car title. They are often pushed deeper into debt as they turn to online loans, prepaid debit cards, payday loans, car-title loans, pawnshops or check-cashing stores that can charge punishing fees. Yet they don’t have a lot of safe, inexpensive consumer-loan alternatives.Prepaid cardholders have been complaining for the past five years about high fees and problems with protecting their accounts. Last week, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau came out with new rules to protect cardholders, which require issuers to disclose fees more clearly and to limit losses to consumers if their cards are lost or stolen. The cards, which have exploded in popularity in the past few years, are sold online or in stores like 7-Eleven and Target. Customers load money onto the cards and use them in place of a checking account. People who are regularly charged bank-overdraft fees often opt to use the cards instead.But in two separate incidents over the past year, consumers were temporarily locked out of their accounts because of a technical glitch. Users of a Wal-Mart-branded prepaid card and the RushCard, which was launched by hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons, were unable to gain access to their money for a week or longer in some cases. Finally, cardholders took to social media to complain that they couldn’t pay for food or gas.Now imagine the reaction if middle-class consumers had trouble withdrawing cash from bank ATMs for more than a week.That’s not the only problem with prepaid cards. Consumers need to double-check that their cards carry government-backed insurance, something bank customers can take for granted. They also may not realize that some prepaid issuers charge $3 to speak to a customer service representative, or even to check a card’s remaining balance at an ATM. The Wells scandal has led many to call for stronger consumer protection for banking customers. Advocates have for years been seeking basic safeguards for people who rely on a prepaid card, given that it lacks many financial protections that are standard for checking accounts and bank debit and credit cards.The new CFPB rules help to bring the cards “out of the shadows,” as Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center, put it.But not entirely. The Washington Post noted that the financial protection bureau did not require all prepaid card companies to insure funds with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Instead, they just have to warn consumers when funds aren’t insured.The rules, which take effect in October 2017, don’t address the kinds of technical outages that customers experienced with the RushCard and others, according to the Post. Glitches hit prepaid cardholders harder because they usually don’t have another credit card to pull out of their wallet. Their money is frozen until the outage is fixed. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is also moving to regulate payday and other consumer loans. When borrowers take out an online payday loan, for example, they often don’t realize they could be charged unexpected fees, or perhaps lose their bank account entirely if they fall behind on payments.When a payment is late, payday lenders are able to deduct money directly from a borrower’s bank account. But payments are often late because borrowers are short of cash. The result is that half of online borrowers wind up with an average of $185 in bank overdraft fees on their accounts, a recent report found, because at least one lender’s debit attempt fails.Other ideas are being considered. The United States Postal Service, according to one proposal, could begin to provide basic banking and financial services. This program would both help the underbanked and revive the many struggling post offices across the nation.  Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont supported this plan during the primaries. It now is part of the Democratic Party platform.People who are totally unbanked amount to some 15 percent of all consumers, or 37 million adults, which is just shy of California’s population, Pew Charitable Trusts found. Estimates of all underserved consumers, including those with bank accounts but who also rely on check cashers and pawnshops, range as high as 88 million.It’s harder to measure what they pay for living on the financial margins.((Mary Kane is a business writer who focuses on fringe financial services.

746,"   By Dan Freed and Elizabeth Dilts | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Wells Fargo & Co's veteran chairman and chief executive officer, John Stumpf, abruptly departed on Wednesday bowing to  pressure over its sales tactics that has damaged the bank's reputation and put Wall Street under renewed scrutiny.San Francisco-based Wells Fargo said Stumpf, 63, was retiring and would be replaced as chief executive by President and Chief Operating Officer Tim Sloan, 56.The bank is splitting the role of chairman and CEO with Stephen Sanger, its lead director, becoming chairman.Stumpf's exit leaves Sloan with a steep challenge in rebuilding its reputation and overhauling its hard-charging sales culture without gutting profits. The new CEO will also contend with ongoing regulatory investigations and private litigation.The departure is a stunning reversal of fortune for Stumpf, who successfully navigated Wells through the financial crisis and built it into the world's most valuable bank with a focus on Main Street-style lending that was the envy of Wall Street.""I have decided it is best for the company that I step aside,"" he said in a statement.The bank's shares, which have slumped in the wake of the scandal, rose 2 percent in after-hours trading after the bank announced Stumpf's exit.Sloan said his immediate priority was to restore trust in the bank. Long considered Stumpf's successor, Sloan has spent most of his career at Wells working with corporations and institutional investors not the retail division, where the fraudulent accounts were opened.But as the former CFO, and president and COO of the company since November, he has been responsible for the entire company, including the retail bank at the heart of the scandal.Carrie Tolstedt, the woman who ran the retail division when the misconduct occurred, reported to Sloan from November of last year. She left the bank last month.""They had three goals in replacing Stumpf: speed, integrity, and competence. If you want to move very fast and find someone intimately familiar with the business, you've got to hire an insider,"" said Peter Conti-Brown, a business ethics and law professor at University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business.""If you want to hire someone with unimpeachable integrity, that's going to take time to find,"" Conti-Brown said. Sloan will preside over the bank's third-quarter earnings on Friday.FALL FROM GRACE Stumpf's fall from grace started with a $185 million regulatory settlement between the bank, regulatory authorities and a Los Angeles prosecutor over its staff opening as many as 2 million accounts without customers' knowledge. The misconduct, carried out by low-level branch staff to meet internal sales targets, shattered the bank's folksy image and a raft of federal and state investigations followed.Stumpf was summoned before the U.S. Senate and faced calls for his resignation after repeatedly deferring responsibility to low level workers and decision-making authority to his board of directors. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren called him a ""gutless leader"" who ""should be criminally investigated.""A week after that hearing, he agreed to forgo $41 million in unvested stock awards.However, that was not enough and at a second hearing, some lawmakers called for the bank to be broken up.California State Treasurer John Chiang, who announced a year-long ban on state business with Wells Fargo, released a statement praising Stumpf's resignation.""Based on his duck, dodge, and deny performance in the wake of admissions that his bank had fleeced legions of its own customers, he was not - and would never be - the change agent leader Wells Fargo so desperately needs,"" Chiang said in the statement.John Thielen, who grew up with Stumpf in Piers, Minnesota where he was a year behind the future CEO in school, said he felt sorry for Stumpf.""He's in hot water, but I think he put himself there,"" Thielen told Reuters in a recent interview that preceded Stumpf's resignation.

754,"   By David Henry and Dan Freed | NEW YORK  NEW YORK JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N) trounced third-quarter estimates on Friday on a sharp rebound in trading revenues while Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) barely beat expectations as a sales scandal engulfed the bank.Wells Fargo is under pressure to keep its profit engine humming while dismantling the aggressive sales culture at the heart of its woes, since unlike JPMorgan and Citigroup it does not have a big trading arm.""We're prepared for things to get worse before they get better,"" Chief Executive Tim Sloan, who took over as boss on Wednesday after John Stumpf, the bank's veteran leader, announced he was leaving amid a public furor over the scandal.Revelations that Wells' branch staff had opened as many as 2 million accounts without customers' knowledge to meet internal sales targets has shattered the bank's folksy image.Once a Wall Street darling for its ability to sell multiple products to individual customers, Wells Fargo said on Friday that new account openings had dropped sharply.New consumer checking accounts were 30 percent lower than in August, and applications for consumer credit cards fell 30 percent in September from the prior month.Wells Fargo's staff are in a period of flux after the bank scrapped sales targets for branches last month and in a note following Sloan's presentation, Brian Kleinhanzl, an analyst at KBW, said, “Management doesn’t know what the consumer bank will look like in the future."" The bank has said the scandal will minimally affect its wealth management business and was unlikely to alter its plans to return capital to shareholders.On Friday, the state of Ohio joined a growing list of municipalities to suspend business relationships with Wells Fargo. The bank makes less than 1 percent of its revenue from working with local governments but Ohio's decision is a blow, coming days after Stumpf, a lightning rod for much of the criticism around the scandal, had departed. Sloan must navigate federal and state investigations in coming months. The scandal has renewed left-leaning lawmakers' attacks on Wall Street and bolstered their mission to introduce stricter oversight.JPMORGAN MOMENTUM CONTINUES While Wells Fargo's overall profit dropped for a fourth straight quarter, net income in the third quarter topped estimates, helped in part by lower-than-expected loan-loss provisions. JPMorgan and Citi also beat expectations as bond trading roared back in the third quarter, boosted by Brexit-inspired volatility along with changing expectations for monetary policy in the United States, Europe and Japan as well as money market reforms.Banks got a fillip from a rise in the London interbank offered rate, which moved to a seven-year high during the quarter as U.S. money market funds scaled back holdings of short-term bank debt in advance of new U.S. regulations.JPMorgan's chief financial officer, Marianne Lake, said the fourth quarter so far is showing positive signs.""The momentum that I just characterized as fairly broad and fairly consistent across the (third) quarter, has somewhat continued so far,"" she told journalists.JPMorgan's after-tax income dropped 7.6 percent after recording a tax expense, compared with a rare tax benefit of $2.2 billion a year earlier. But revenues and profits both topped analysts' estimates. Citigroup, the fourth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, beat expectations for third-quarter net profit after trading revenue surged 35 percent.While net income fell 11 percent to $1.24 per share, it exceeded the average estimate of $1.16 per share. Total adjusted revenue fell 4 percent to $17.76 billion, but beat the average estimate of $17.36 billion.The strong trading performance helped U.S. financial stocks snap a three-day losing streak, with markets-focused bank shares such as Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) up 2 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively, ahead of their results next week. Citigroup was up over 0.8 percent in late trade after earlier rising as much as 3 percent. JPMorgan tipped into negative territory after earlier gaining as much as 2 percent. Wells Fargo was up 0.25 percent. The S&P financial index .SPSY gained 0.85 percent.The British government's tougher line on immigration in the wake of the Brexit vote has bankers preparing for a scenario in which London loses access to the single market, meaning they would have to move parts of their operations elsewhere in Europe.""As a result, we will be starting to build out technology systems and operations in Europe,"" JPMorgan's Lake said.

757,"   By Elizabeth Dilts | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Wells Fargo & Co's wealth management unit has changed the way it reports cross-selling, the strategy at the heart of the scandal over its aggressive sales targets, and now reporting assets referred from bank employees.The wealth management business reported a gain of $1 billion in ""referred investment assets"" in the third quarter after referrals from employees in bank branches, according to corporate filings. The figure is in line with prior trends, the bank said on Friday.Cross-selling, or getting customers to buy products and services from several business lines, was previously reported as a figure that showed the average number of accounts held by a client household if that client also had retail bank accounts, like checking or savings accounts.In August 2015, the last quarter for which it was reported, the bank said the average wealth management client household had 10.52 accounts, the highest average account number of any of the bank's business divisions.  Meanwhile, Wells Fargo said total profits dropped for the fourth straight quarter as it set aside funds for potential legal costs from a bogus-account scandal that led to its chief executive officer stepping down.The wealth business reported profit jumped 16 percent over the previous quarter to $677 million on higher asset-based fees and a greater percentage of brokers' paychecks being deferred. Cross-selling is a widespread practice at banks and brokerages, but the affair at Wells Fargo's community bank raised questions about whether it is appropriate to set aggressive sales targets for employees, and whether customers really need all the products offered.Massachusetts regulators recently charged Morgan Stanley with ""dishonest and unethical conduct"" for having pushed its brokers to sell loans to their clients.  Last quarter, Wells Fargo's wealth and investment management unit said it was ""evaluating changes in our cross-sell methodology to better align our metrics with ongoing changes in WIM's business and products,"" according to corporate filings.Wells Fargo did not immediately respond to request for comment.

758,"   By Richa Naidu and Dan Freed  Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, reported its first profit increase in three quarters on Monday, foiling expectations for another drop, as bond trading surged and expenses fell.Like rivals JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N), Bank of America enjoyed a boost from a resurgence in trading. That came as clients scrambled to reposition after Britain's surprise June vote to leave the European Union, and changing expectations for monetary policy in the United States, Europe and Japan.Chief Executive Brian Moynihan's cost-cutting campaign also paid off as expenses fell in each of its four major business segments.On a pretax basis, quarterly profit was at its highest in a decade. Net income attributable to shareholders rose 6.6 percent to $4.45 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from a year ago. Earnings per share rose to 41 cents, from 38 cents in the same period of 2015. Analysts, on average, had estimated a decline to 34 cents a share.Revenue grew 3 percent to $21.64 billion, beating the $20.97 billion expected by analysts.Net profit in Bank of America's trading-focused Global Markets arm jumped 34 percent from a year earlier as revenue from dealing fixed-income securities, currencies and commodities surged 39 percent. Equity trading revenue fell 17 percent.  Last week, JPMorgan reported a 48 percent increase in bond trading and Citi posted a 35 percent gain. Trading in stocks rose 1 percent and fell 34 percent respectively at JPMorgan and Citi.Like Bank of America, JMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo beat third-quarter profit and revenue forecasts but their net earnings declined; JPMorgan Chase & Co's (JPM.N) by 7.6 percent, Citigroup Inc's (C.N) by 10.5 percent and Wells Fargo & Co's (WFC.N) by 3.7 percent.Shares of Bank of America were little changed, up 0.15 percent in afternoon trading. Ahead of Monday, the stock had shed 4.9 percent since the start of the year, compared to a 2.5 percent decline in the KBW banking index .BKX. DUAL ROLES After scandal-ridden Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) separated its chief executive and chairman roles last week with the retirement of John Stumpf, Moynihan was asked during a conference call on Monday whether he expected renewed pressure to give up his dual role from regulators or shareholders.""Our lead independent director duty is as strong as anybody's in the industry,"" said Moynihan, who had faced down a shareholder vote last year over whether to split the roles. He added that he felt ""comfortable"" with the bank's current governance.  Bank of America's large stock of deposits and rate-sensitive mortgage securities make it particularly dependent on a rise in interest rates to boost profits.To compensate for stubbornly low interest rates, Moynihan made trimming costs a top priority, saying in July he would cut annual expenses by another $5 billion by 2018, which would take the total to about $53 billion from about $58 billion in 2015.In the third quarter, non-interest expenses fell 3.3 percent to $13.48 billion as headcount fell by 3 percent.Like rivals, Bank of America got a boost from a rise in the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, a benchmark for more than $300 trillion worth of financial products worldwide.Libor moved to a seven-year high during the third quarter as U.S. money market funds scaled back holdings in short-term bank debt in advance of new regulations.   Bank of America's net interest income rose 3 percent to $10.20 billion, the first increase in three quarters.Like JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, BofA set aside more money to cover potential bad loans. The bank's provisions rose 5.5 percent to $850 million in the quarter.Income from investment banking rose 13.3 percent to $1.46 billion, driven by higher debt and equity issuance activity. Revenue for advising on deals tumbled 19 percent as companies held off making acquisitions amid political uncertainty in the United States and Brexit-related volatility in Britain.Adjusted revenue from Bank of America's wealth and investment management unit, which includes Merrill Lynch, fell 1.7 percent to $4.38 billion, but a 6 percent drop in non-interest expenses helped to boost net income by 10 percent.The wealth business, which has been a stable source of revenue growth when trading and investment banking revenues have fluctuated, is undergoing its own changes, with a new boss, longtime executive Andy Sieg, expected to take over in 2017 and amid a regulatory overhaul of financial advice in the United States.

""We value the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’ business and will work to earn it back,"" the bank said in a statement.  Last month, Wells Fargo agreed to pay a $190 million settlement over its staff opening as many as 2 million accounts without customers' knowledge. The misconduct triggered a raft of federal and state investigations and led to the resignation last week of its chief executive and chairman, John Stumpf. Earlier this month following the scandal, Massachusetts, as well as Oregon and the city of New York, said they were reviewing their business relationships with the firm.

In addition to highlighting potential security risks inherent to such interbank transfers, Banco del Austro's lawsuit was also seen by legal experts as a key test of whether a so-called correspondent bank - in this case Wells Fargo - could be held liable for authorizing authenticated SWIFT transfer messages. In Tuesday's ruling Kaplan threw out breach of contract and negligence claims against Wells Fargo but denied the U.S. bank's bid to dismiss alleged violations of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, which governs whether fund transfer security procedures are ""commercially reasonable.""Kaplan said the court could not ""rule as a matter of law that use of the SWIFT system, with nothing more, constituted a commercially reasonable security procedure in the context of this particular customer-bank relationship.""Wells Fargo, which has previously maintained that it properly processed the wire instructions via authenticated SWIFT messages, could not be immediately reached for comment on Tuesday's ruling.

786,"   By Dan Freed and Jonathan Stempel  Wells Fargo & Co's effort to recover from one of the worst scandals in its nearly 200-year history will face a major test next week, when Warren Buffett is expected to weigh in.Buffett, who chairs Wells Fargo's largest shareholder, Berkshire Hathaway Inc, had said he would wait until November to comment on the issue of the bank having created up to 2 million unauthorized customer accounts. Staff at Wells Fargo, the third-largest U.S. bank, had opened these accounts in retail customers' names without their knowledge in order to boost their sales figures, regulators alleged in a Sept. 8 settlement.Berkshire, which owns about 10 percent of Wells Fargo, will file a quarterly report next Friday that typically includes details about its largest holdings.Buffett can influence a stock price or even the makeup of a broader shareholder base by putting his stamp of approval on a company, or removing it.Disclosing the status of the Wells Fargo investment could have a big impact, analysts and investors said. The bank's stock was initially hit hard by the accounts debacle, but has recovered somewhat since its chief executive, John Stumpf, was replaced on Oct. 12.The scandal has also triggered monetary penalties, compensation clawbacks, lost business and damage to Wells Fargo's reputation.KEY SHAREHOLDER ""You can believe that Buffett had input into that whole thing: every decision that's been made"" since the scandal erupted, said Nancy Bush, an independent stock analyst with NAB Research.Bush did not believe Buffett had reduced his stake in Wells Fargo, but said that ""would be a big deal,"" and that the quarterly report will be ""closely watched."" Berkshire did not respond to requests for comment.The Omaha, Nebraska-based company began investing in Wells Fargo in 1989, and quickly built a 10 percent stake at a cost of $289 million.The percentage stake fell over time, until Buffett began ramping it up more than a decade ago. Berkshire eventually acquired roughly half a billion shares, reaching the 10 percent threshold again in March. Berkshire soon asked the U.S. Federal Reserve for permission to buy more.Buffett is known as the ""Oracle of Omaha"" for his sharp-sighted investments, and has a reputation for propriety.He took to the helm of Salomon Brothers in 1991 to repair its standing after the Wall Street bank was accused of illegal Treasury auction bidding. In testimony before Congress that year, Buffett said he would be understanding of employees who lose money, but admonished: ""Lose a shred of reputation for the firm, and I will be ruthless."" Buffett has not made any public statements about the Wells Fargo scandal, but CNBC reported in late September that he had spoken with Stumpf, and believed management had underestimated the extent of its problems.""This is the kind of conduct Buffett hates, and I don't expect him to pull any punches with respect to what went on,"" said James Armstrong, president of Henry H. Armstrong Associates, a Pittsburgh-based money manager that owns $147 million of Berkshire stock.COMPLICATED EXIT Wells Fargo was, until recently, the most valuable bank by market capitalization globally. Its stock fell as much as 12 percent in the four weeks after it agreed on Sept. 8 to pay $185 million to settle charges by regulators and a Los Angeles prosecutor regarding the sham accounts.Its shares have rebounded somewhat since Stumpf's departure, with the stock closing at $46.41 on Thursday, up more than 6 percent from an Oct. 4 trough. However, Wells Fargo remains a laggard, down 14.6 percent this year compared with a 2.8 percent rise for the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index.

788,"   By Dena Aubin | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) has agreed to pay $50 million to settle a racketeering lawsuit accusing it of overcharging hundreds of thousands of homeowners for appraisals ordered after they defaulted on their mortgage loans. The proposed settlement, which requires court approval, was disclosed in a filing on Friday in an Oakland, California federal court. If approved, it will resolve nationwide claims that Wells Fargo charged much more than it paid for third-party appraisals, exploiting borrowers who could least afford it and driving them further into default.Wells Fargo's settlement of the lawsuit comes as the bank is still recoiling from a scandal over sales targets that drove employees to create unauthorized accounts for customers. Multiple lawsuits over those practices are pending.Spokesman Tom Goyda said Wells Fargo believes its appraisal practices were proper and disagreed with the lawsuit's claims  but settled to avoid further litigation. Plaintiffs' lawyer Roland Tellis said: ""We’re very pleased to have negotiated a settlement that achieves our litigation goals.""About 250,000 homeowners are covered by the proposed deal, he said.  Mortgage agreements allow banks to charge homeowners for the appraisals if they default on their mortgage loans, but Wells Fargo added large mark-ups to the amounts its third-party vendors charged, the 2012 lawsuit said. Wells Fargo typically charged $95 to $125 for the type of expedited appraisal at issue, when the actual cost was $50 or less, the complaint said. The charges added hundreds or thousands of dollars to borrower's mortgage loans over time, the lawsuit said.  Customers did not know they had been victimized because the charges were described on statements with cryptic labels such as ""other charges,"" the lawsuit said.The plaintiffs had sought triple damages under the U.S. Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. The lawsuit said sending invoices and statements with the fraudulently concealed fees constituted mail and wire fraud sufficient to allege racketeering.  In court filings, lawyers for Wells had called those claims ""far-fetched."" The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and courts have recognized that fees similar to Wells Fargo's can include a profit margin, the lawyers said.The case is: Bias et al v Wells Fargo & Co, U.S. District Court, California Northern District, no 12-cv-664",2016-10-31,WFC,"Mon Oct 31, 2016 | 3:43pm EDT",Wells Fargo agrees to $50 mln settlement over homeowner fees,http://www.reuters.com//article/wellsfargo-settlement-idUSL1N1D11I2?type=companyNews

802,"   By Dan Freed  Wells Fargo & Co's (WFC.N) CEO Tim Sloan said on Thursday a comprehensive review of the bank's sales practices would be done 'relatively quickly' and unveiled a series of immediate changes at the bank's retail unit under new division boss Mary Mack.Management is reaching out to employees who were wrongly fired, while continuing to review sales practices across the bank, and changing compensation plans to avoid incentivizing bad behavior. It is also ramping up marketing efforts after having slowed them in the wake of the problems, Mack told an industry conference in Boston, her first with analysts since taking over the retail business. The bank, which earlier said in a regulatory filing that legal costs could exceed reserves by $1.7 billion, has also hired an outside consultant to guide changes to the retail business. The retail unit's new risk chief now reports into the broader company's risk chief, rather than to Mack. The bank also said it created a new 'Change Leader' position in the unit to focus on 'what great customer experience looks like,' according to Mack and Sloan's presentation.""We're going to leave no stone unturned,"" said Sloan. ""I don't want there to be a question about how we interact with customers at Wells Fargo,"" he added. ""We're going to put that to rest. That's going to be done in a very comprehensive way and it's going to be done relatively quickly, but it's going to be done right.""An independent consultant is now reviewing sales practices across the whole bank, Sloan said, without identifying the company. Because most of Wells Fargo's senior leadership has been at the bank for a long time, they may have inadvertently contributed to some of its problems, he said.Wells Fargo's period of atonement follows a $185 million settlement on Sept. 8 with federal regulators and a Los Angeles prosecutor regarding its opening as many as 2 million accounts in retail customers' names without their permission. At the time, the bank said it fired 5,300 employees for improper sales practices over a period of five years, but since then reports have surfaced of employees also being fired for raising red flags or not meeting aggressive sales quotas imposed by their managers.Wells Fargo welcomes back employees fired 'inappropriately' if they would like to return, Sloan said. He took the reins on Oct. 12 from former CEO John Stumpf, who abruptly left the bank under harsh scrutiny for its practices. Mack became head of the retail unit in July, before the scandal came to light. She replaced Carrie Tolstedt, who forfeited $19 million in stock in September following a public uproar over the sales issues. Stumpf gave up $41 million. Even with the settlement, the management shakeup and the steps is taking to improve, Wells Fargo's problems are not over.The bank faces probes from several other regulators and authorities, including the U.S. Department of Justice and congressional committees. The Securities and Exchange Commission is also examining the bank, Wells said in its filing on Thursday.Wells' $1.7 billion estimate of its potential legal expense shortfall is up from a $1 billion estimate in August.

806,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Friday said third-quarter profit dropped 24 percent from a year earlier, when it recorded a large one-time gain, but acquisitions helped boost operating profit at the conglomerate run by billionaire Warren Buffett.The company also reported a $22.1 billion stake in Wells Fargo & Co as of Sept. 30, suggesting it kept its 10 percent ownership position even as the bank became embroiled in a scandal over its creation of unauthorized customer accounts. Berkshire is Wells Fargo's largest shareholder.Quarterly net income for Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire fell to $7.2 billion, or $4,379 per Class A share, from $9.43 billion, or $5,737 per share, a year earlier.Operating profit, which excludes investment and derivative gains and losses, rose 7 percent to $4.85 billion, or $2,951 per share, from $4.55 billion, or $2,769 per share.That missed the average $3,058.10 per share forecast of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, in part reflecting weaker results at the Geico auto insurer and BNSF railroad, and falling demand from customers in industrial sectors.Results included a $1.6 billion gain when Mars Inc bought Berkshire's preferred stock investment in its Wrigley chewing gum business. Last year's results included a $4.4 billion gain related to the food company Kraft Heinz Co.Revenue was nearly unchanged at $59.1 billion. Book value per share, Buffett's preferred measure of growth, rose 2 percent from the end of June to $163,783.Berkshire also ended September with $84.8 billion of cash, despite having completed a $32.1 billion purchase of aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts Corp in January that was a key factor behind the boost in operating profit.In a change, Buffett highlighted the cash hoard in Berkshire's press release accompanying results.""He has $85 billion of cash earning nothing,"" said Steven Check, who invests $1.1 billion, of which 30 percent is in Berkshire, at Check Capital Management Inc in Costa Mesa, California. ""It gives Berkshire a lot of pent-up firepower for more acquisitions."" WELLS FARGO Since taking over Berkshire in 1965, Buffett has built a conglomerate with roughly 90 businesses including Brooks running shoes, Dairy Queen ice cream and Fruit of the Loom underwear.Berkshire also owns dozens of companies' stocks, including Apple Inc, Coca-Cola Co and International Business Machines Corp.Though the value of the Wells Fargo investment fell from $23.7 billion at the end of June, the decline can be explained by the more than 6 percent drop in the bank's share price. That suggests that Berkshire has kept its roughly 500 million shares in the third-largest U.S. bank.Buffett has over the years repeatedly praised Wells Fargo, whose stock Berkshire has owned since 1989, and this year asked the U.S. Federal Reserve for permission to buy more.But he also warned that companies guard against the kind of reputational damage that Wells Fargo has suffered over the sham accounts, estimated to number up to 2 million, which have prompted a variety of potentially costly regulatory probes. Buffett has said he would talk this month about the scandal, which emerged on Sept. 8 when Wells Fargo agreed to pay $185 million in fines to settle charges by U.S. regulators and a Los Angeles prosecutor.BNSF STRUGGLES  Berkshire's operating businesses posted mixed results.Overall insurance profit fell 11 percent to $1.12 billion, and included a 34 percent drop from underwriting.Geico saw pre-tax underwriting gains slide by 47 percent in the quarter, as higher losses from storms and accidents offset increases in premium rates.But float, or the amount of insurance premiums collected before claims are paid and which help fund Berkshire's growth, rose to $91 billion from $90 billion at the end of June.Profit from manufacturing, service and retailing companies rose 45 percent to $1.7 billion, as the addition of Precision helped offset ""sluggish demand"" for industrial products from the oil and gas and heavy equipment industries.BNSF saw profit fall 12 percent to $1.02 billion, hurt by a decline in coal and petroleum shipments that has dampened results this year and which Berkshire expects to persist.The Berkshire Hathaway Energy unit saw profit rise 19 percent to $932 million, helped by higher electricity margins at its MidAmerican Energy unit.In Friday trading, Berkshire Class A shares fell $456, or 0.2 percent, to $214,545 and Class B shares fell 69 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $142.95.

812,"   By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday indicated it could allow Miami to pursue lawsuits accusing major banks of predatory mortgage lending to black and Hispanic home buyers resulting in loan defaults that drove down city tax revenues and property values.The eight justices heard arguments in appeals filed by Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo & Co challenging a lower court's decision to permit the lawsuits by the Florida city against the banks. The cases were filed under the Fair Housing Act, a federal law outlawing discrimination in housing. In September 2015, the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a lower court's decision to dismiss such lawsuits by the city against Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup Inc. Citigroup decided not to appeal to the Supreme Court. If the court splits 4-4, the 11th Circuit ruling would stand and Miami would prevail, but no national precedent would be set.Based on the questions asked by the justices, it appeared unlikely the banks would gain the five votes needed to win the case outright. But it was possible that a ruling for Miami could allow the lawsuits to move forward while narrowing the scope of the cases and potentially lowering the amount of damages the city could win.Chief Justice John Roberts seemed most skeptical of the city's lawsuit, at one point questioning whether a loss of property taxes could count as a direct injury that could give rise to a lawsuit. Roberts said the city's alleged injuries are ""derivative of the injury to the homeowners who had the subprime mortgages and who suffered the foreclosure and so on."" Fellow conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy, who could cast the key vote to avoid a 4-4 split, seemed somewhat sympathetic to the banks, particularly over the amount of damages they could face. Liberal Justice Elena Kagan was among those who seemed open to the case moving forward, saying the Fair Housing Act was designed to address harms to communities, not just individuals. ""Who better than the city to recognize that interest and assert it?"" Kagan said. The banks have said a ruling favoring Miami would lead to a surge of similar suits.The court is due to rule by the end of June. Miami accused Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Citigroup of steering non-white borrowers into higher-cost loans they often could not afford, even if they had good credit.The city said the banks' conduct caused Miami to lose property tax revenues, drove down property values and required the city to pay the costs of repairing and maintaining properties that went into foreclosure due to discriminatory lending.Several U.S. cities, including Los Angeles and Oakland, have launched similar lawsuits.

Another, Gamco CEO Mario Gabelli, would not discuss the board's performance. However, he said he would welcome Warren Buffett, whose company is Wells Fargo's top investor, becoming a director.Reuters contacted more than two dozen of the top 100 Wells Fargo investors to determine whether the sales scandal affected their views on the stock. Five - the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS), New York City Retirement Systems, union-affiliated CtW Investment Group and fund managers Gardner, Russo & Gardner and Gamco Investors Inc - offered comments. Others declined to be interviewed or did not respond.Investors who spoke to Reuters directly own or advise others who own about 71 million Wells Fargo shares, 1.4 percent of all outstanding stock, worth about $3.7 billion as of Friday's close.One key criticism: the board was slow to tackle and disclose sales practices that led to the opening of as many as 2 million accounts without customers' permission.Shareholders also said they had trouble understanding who was responsible for what on various board committees.For instance, the finance committee oversees ""financial risk"" and ""reputation risk,"" according to its charter. However, there is also a separate risk committee, and a corporate responsibility committee that ""monitor(s) the company's reputation generally."" Committee chairs are supposed to coordinate to avoid unnecessary duplication.""Until we get a bit more of this information it's hard to know whether the board should change or who should be held accountable,"" Anne Sheehan, director of corporate governance at CalSTRS, told Reuters.CalSTRS had just under $500 million worth of Wells Fargo stock in its most recent disclosure.Three of the shareholders told Reuters it was too early to tell whether they would bring any of the issues to a vote at the annual shareholder meeting in April or take any other action if the results of the bank's internal investigation and their conversations with the board proved unsatisfactory.Shares of Wells Fargo, the third-largest U.S. bank, lost as much as 12 percent of their value in the weeks after the scandal erupted. The stock began to recover after former Chairman and CEO John Stumpf resigned on Oct. 12. Tim Sloan replaced him as CEO and independent director Stephen Sanger became chairman.In step with other banks, Wells Fargo's stock has soared since the U.S. presidential election. The bank's shares are down 2.1 percent so far this year compared with a 12.1 percent gain for the S&P 500 Banks Index. A Wells Fargo spokesman declined to comment for this story and said neither Sloan nor Stumpf were available. A spokesman at Sard Verbinnen representing outside directors declined to comment, as did Buffett. Individual board members either declined to comment, did not return requests for comment, or could not be reached.TAKING ACTION Since Wells Fargo reached a settlement with regulators on Sept. 8, it has launched an internal probe, apologized to customers and employees, changed compensation plans and hired a consultant to review sales practices.A seldom-used clawback provision was also triggered to recover $41 million in stock compensation from Stumpf and $19 million from Carrie Tolstedt, who ran the retail banking unit in which 5,300 employees were fired for improper account openings.Earlier this month, Sloan said management would ""leave no stone unturned"" in its review and that the bank would learn from its mistakes. Encouraged by Wells Fargo's response to the crisis, Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck has recommended its shares, saying management is strong and the board is ""taking action.""In a CNN interview last week, Buffett said he did not sell any Wells Fargo shares because he has faith in the bank over the long term - as well as Sloan, whom he described as ""exactly right"" for the CEO job.

821,"   By Olivia Oran  Wells Fargo & Co is set to announce a partnership with SigFig for clients to use the robo-adviser's technology and wealth management investment tools.    The announcement is expected on Tuesday, the bank said, with Wells likely to roll out a pilot version of the service during the first half of 2017. ""As we continue to invest in technology that serves the evolving needs of our clients and our advisors, this offering will mark an important step forward in delivering financial advice to the next generation of investors, while building a long-term pipeline for our full-service business,"" said David Carroll, head of wealth and investment management at Wells Fargo.     Wall Street banks and investment firms are increasingly building or buying robo-advisers to provide automated investment advice through web-based platforms at a lower cost than traditional financial advisers.  Unlike Betterment and Wealthfront which have focused on catering directly to young, tech-savvy millennials, SigFig has been forging relationships with banks. UBS Group AG said in May it had bought an undisclosed stake in SigFig. The two companies also said they would form a research lab to collaborate on new wealth technology. Wells' strategy of putting SigFig in the hands of its investing customers is different than that of UBS, which is rolling out the service for its financial advisers to help construct investment portfolios and other activities that can be automated.     Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp are building their own technologies, while BlackRock Inc acquired FutureAdvisor last August. The digital wealth management market could top $20 trillion in assets by 2020, according to consulting firm A.T. Kearney.

822,"   By Jonathan Stempel and Jeffrey Dastin | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Monday said it has bought shares in the four biggest U.S. airlines: American Airlines Group Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc, Southwest Airlines Co and United Continental Holdings Inc.The investments mark an unexpected reversal for Berkshire, which has avoided the airline sector for nearly two decades after a troubled investment in the former US Air Group, a forerunner to American.They also expand Berkshire's bet on the U.S. economy, and in particular transportation. Berkshire already owns the BNSF railroad and the NetJets luxury plane unit, and in January paid $32.1 billion for aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts.According to a regulatory filing, Berkshire as of Sept. 30 owned 21.8 million American shares worth $797 million, 6.3 million Delta shares worth $249.3 million, and 4.5 million United shares worth $237.8 million.Buffett told CNBC television that Berkshire later invested in Southwest, and was disclosing that stake to avoid misleading investors into believing he was avoiding the carrier.It is unclear whether Buffett or one of his deputies, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, invested in the airlines.Shares often rise when investors perceive that Berkshire has given them its imprimatur.Buffett usually handles larger Berkshire investments such as Kraft Heinz Co, Wells Fargo & Co, Coca-Cola Co and International Business Machines Corp.His Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate also owns roughly 90 companies such as BNSF, Geico car insurance and Dairy Queen ice cream.The airline investments are ""really important for investor confidence"" in that sector, said Adam Hackel, an airline analyst at Imperial Capital LLC in New York. Berkshire did not respond to requests for comment.In after-hours trading, American shares rose 3.8 percent, Delta 3.4 percent, Southwest 3.3 percent and United 2.2 percent.U.S. airlines have benefited in recent years from lower fuel costs, labor peace, higher fees from checked bags and other once-free services, and reduced competition through mergers.Such factors helped the four largest U.S. carriers post a record $21.7 billion combined profit in 2015, and command more than two-thirds of the domestic market. WRIGHT BROTHERS, WRONG INVESTMENT Berkshire had ventured into airlines in 1989 when Buffett bought $358 million of USAir preferred stock, but he quickly regretted that investment.In 1997, he told Berkshire shareholders he had misjudged how USAir would ""increasingly feel the effects of an unregulated, fiercely-competitive market whereas its cost structure was a holdover from the days when regulation protected profits.""Eleven years later, Buffett felt no better, calling airlines a capital-intensive business that earned little or no money.""A durable competitive advantage has proven elusive ever since the days of the Wright Brothers,"" he wrote in his February 2008 shareholder letter. ""Indeed, if a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down."" Buffett nonetheless admitted to having sold the USAir stock, in 1998, at a ""hefty gain.""Orville Wright died in 1948, more than 44 years after he and his brother Wilbur flew their plane at Kitty Hawk, N.C.American and Delta said they welcomed Berkshire as an investor, and American said it ""reinforces our view that our industry has fundamentally changed in a profound and lasting way.""Southwest declined to comment. United had no immediate comment.Berkshire on Monday also disclosed other portfolio changes.It slashed its stake in Wal-Mart Stores Inc by roughly two-thirds to 13 million shares. Berkshire had begun paring its stake in the world's largest retailer earlier this year, after more than a decade of ownership.Separately, Berkshire reduced its stake in pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Inc, and exited an investment in Canadian oil and gas producer Suncor Energy Inc.

823,"   By Dan Freed and Richa Naidu  Wells Fargo & Co's (WFC.N) account openings slowed in October following a sales scandal that shattered the bank's folksy image, triggered federal and state investigations, and cost the bank's chief executive his job.October consumer account openings slumped 27 percent from September and were down 44 percent from a year earlier, Wells Fargo said on Thursday. New credit card applications fell 35 percent from November and 50 percent from a year ago.""Because the sales practices settlement was announced on Sept. 8, October data reflects the first full month of impact,"" Mary Mack, head of Wells Fargo's community banking business, said in a statement.On a conference call with analysts, Mack said the decline in new account openings had stabilized but would remain at a lower level throughout the remainder of the year.The bank agreed in September to pay regulators $185 million to settle charges that its staff opened as many as 2 million accounts without customers' knowledge. Reuters reported in October that thousands of small business customers were also affected by the misconduct. The revenue impact from the decline in new account openings will be small, Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said on the call. He estimated that if new credit card applications stay at the same level through the rest of the fourth quarter, it might shave $20-25 million off 2017 revenue estimated by analysts to be more than $91 billion. Shrewsberry said it was too early to estimate the expense impact, which will include litigation and increased costs for compliance and risk management. Since the scandal, Wells Fargo has launched an internal probe, apologized to customers and employees, changed compensation plans and hired a consultant to review sales practices. Thursday's update on retail banking activity, part of an effort to win back the trust of investors, was an ""ongoing commitment to transparency,"" Chief Executive Tim Sloan said in a statement. The bank has also said it would eliminate sales goals for its retail banking business sooner than planned. Former employees have blamed pressure to meet aggressive daily sales quotas for their role in creating the unauthorized accounts. ""We recognize we have work to do and we are focused on strengthening our relationships with existing customers and building new ones with potential customers,"" Mack said.The bank said survey results of consumers' satisfaction with their most recent visit fell to 73.9 percent in October from 77.4 percent a year earlier.Wells Fargo shares were up 1.1 percent in late morning trading Thursday, roughly in line with gains in other U.S. banking giants, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

827,"   By Elizabeth Dilts | NEW YORK  NEW YORK For the first time since UBS Group AG bought PaineWebber 16 years ago, the world's largest wealth manager's U.S. business has a smaller workforce than an independent rival, Raymond James Financial.But does Tom Naratil, president of UBS's Wealth Management Americas, care?""No. We don't,"" Naratil told Reuters on Wednesday. ""For six years, we've said it was all about the productivity of advisers and not the number of advisers."" In June, Naratil launched plans to cut the firm's costly recruiting efforts by 40 percent, streamline broker's compensation and eliminate some middle management.The cuts are part of a broader effort to boost lagging revenue. Some of the money saved from recruiting will go to pay existing advisers bonuses for growing their business. It is already working, Naratil said, pointing to the record revenues, income and pre-tax profit margins reported in the third quarter.There are costs to leaving the recruiting game amid a decade-long trend of advisers moving from Wall Street brokerages to independent outfits, like Raymond James. St. Petersburg, Florida-based Raymond James reported it had 7,146 advisers across its employee and independent channels in the third quarter, compared to UBS's 7,087. ""We don't need to wake up every morning and pray for the independent adviser model to fail in order for us to succeed,"" said Naratil, who took on the top job in January.The cuts, combined with an expected increase in the Federal Reserve's interest rate in December will help the firm reach its goal of 15-25 percent pre-tax profit margins, Naratil said.Additionally, the uncertainty for some investors created by the surprise election of Republican Donald Trump as U.S. president is also good for business, said the former PaineWebber bond trader.  A UBS survey of 1,200 wealthy investors found that half missed money-making opportunities because they raised cash or moved into conservative investments ahead of the election. ""Any kind of uncertainty that people have as a result of geopolitical events or domestic events is good for the advice markets,"" said Naratil, who declined to say whether UBS had been in touch with Trump's transition team. Naratil also declined to comment on the firm's plans to comply with the Labor Department's Fiduciary Rule, which is designed to protect retirement savers by requiring that brokers put their clients' best interests ahead of their own bottom line. It is set to take effect in April. Rival firms like Morgan Stanley and Bank of America's Merrill Lynch announced their plans last month. It is unclear if Trump will try to delay implementation of the rule. Regulators have also narrowed in on the securities industry since the sales scandal at Wells Fargo & Co's retail bank, which opened 2 million accounts for customers without their knowledge. Groups like the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority have ordered brokerages to hand over information about bonuses that brokers can earn for meeting sales targets.Naratil said UBS has examined its sales goals and bonuses.""We don't see anything similar"" to what went on at Wells Fargo's retail bank, Naratil said. ""I don't think it is a problem across the wealth management industry as a whole.""

836,"   By Suzanne Barlyn | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Nov 24 Wells Fargo & Co has asked a U.S. court to order dozens of customers who are suing the bank over the opening of unauthorized accounts to resolve their disputes in private arbitrations instead of court, according to legal documents.The motion, filed in the U.S. District Court in Utah on Wednesday, is in response to the first class action lawsuit filed against Wells since it agreed to pay $185 million in penalties and $5 million to customers for opening up to 2 million deposit and credit-card accounts in their names without their permission.The scandal has shaken Wells, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets. Its former Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf stepped down amid the furor, it has been put under tougher regulatory scrutiny and its reputation has been damaged as it faces multiple probes.The move to enforce the mandatory arbitration clauses comes as Wells Fargo has launched an advertising campaign to win back customer loyalty in the wake of the scandal. No one from Wells Fargo was immediately available to comment on the filing.In a written response to questions from U.S. lawmakers, published last week, the bank said it would stand by its arbitration policy but was offering free mediation services to affected customers.Mandatory arbitration rules inserted into account-opening agreements prohibit customers from joining class actions or suing Wells Fargo. Instead, the agreements require individual, closed-door arbitration. Mandating arbitration when signing up for financial products has become standard practice after a 2011 U.S. Supreme Court decision validated the practice. But customer advocates say it improperly denies customers the legal protections of court proceedings, such as the right to appeal, and helps to conceal corporate misconduct from the public and regulators because documents and hearings are not made public.Customers trying to recover small sums of money are also unlikely to find lawyers to represent them in arbitration, critics say, and the cases do not set a legal precedent to help other affected individuals. Last year, a court dismissed an earlier lawsuit against Wells Fargo, saying that customers had signed arbitration clauses when opening their accounts.The bank has come under fire over its mandatory arbitration clauses from Democratic lawmakers in Congress, including Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a brainchild of Warren, is considering rules to ban banks, credit card issuers and other companies from forcing customers to submit to arbitration and waive their right to join class action lawsuits.But the CFPB could find its powers scaled back by President-elect Donald Trump and a Republican-led Congress, according to members of both political parties, lobbyists and lawyers.

837,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Wells Fargo & Co faces a new U.S. lawsuit claiming that it funneled more than $3 billion of employee retirement savings into expensive, underperforming proprietary mutual funds to enrich itself.The proposed class-action lawsuit, filed on Tuesday in federal court in Minnesota, accused the third-largest U.S. bank of ""self-dealing and imprudent investing"" by steering 401(k)contributions to its Wells Fargo Dow Jones Target Date funds.The lawsuit, filed by employees led by John Meiners, from St. Louis, seeks to recoup excess fees and unrealized profits stemming from Wells Fargo's alleged breach of fiduciary duties to all 401(k) participants over the last six years, the complaint said.A Wells Fargo spokesman had no immediate comment on Friday.Wells Fargo already faces many lawsuits over its opening of unauthorized customer accounts, in a scandal that led to last month's departure of the San Francisco-based bank's longtime chief executive, John Stumpf.Target date funds, also known as lifecycle funds, blend mutual funds that invest in stocks, bonds and cash, shifting the mix based on investors' expected retirement dates. According to the complaint, Wells Fargo's target date funds cost 2.5 times more than similar funds from such rivals as Fidelity Investments and Vanguard Group.In the complaint, Meiners said the difference reflected the layering of an extra set of fees to run the funds, on top of fees to manage the underlying indexed funds.Despite this, assets allegedly grew in part because Wells Fargo made its target date funds a default investment option, and provided an ""easy"" and ""quick"" enrollment feature.

838,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) faces a new U.S. lawsuit claiming that it funneled more than $3 billion of employee retirement savings into expensive, underperforming proprietary mutual funds to enrich itself.The proposed class-action lawsuit, filed on Tuesday in federal court in Minnesota, accused the third-largest U.S. bank of ""self-dealing and imprudent investing"" by steering 401(k)contributions to its Wells Fargo Dow Jones Target Date funds.The lawsuit, filed by employees led by John Meiners, from St. Louis, seeks to recoup excess fees and unrealized profits stemming from Wells Fargo's alleged breach of fiduciary duties to all 401(k) participants over the last six years, the complaint said.A Wells Fargo spokesman had no immediate comment on Friday.Wells Fargo already faces many lawsuits over its opening of unauthorized customer accounts, in a scandal that led to last month's departure of the San Francisco-based bank's longtime chief executive, John Stumpf.Target date funds, also known as lifecycle funds, blend mutual funds that invest in stocks, bonds and cash, shifting the mix based on investors' expected retirement dates. According to the complaint, Wells Fargo's target date funds cost 2.5 times more than similar funds from such rivals as Fidelity Investments and Vanguard Group.In the complaint, Meiners said the difference reflected the layering of an extra set of fees to run the funds, on top of fees to manage the underlying indexed funds.Despite this, assets allegedly grew in part because Wells Fargo made its target date funds a default investment option, and provided an ""easy"" and ""quick"" enrollment feature.This ""generated substantial revenues for Wells Fargo"" and provided ""critical seed money that kept the funds afloat by boosting market share,"" the complaint said.

Its former Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf stepped down amid the furor, it has been put under tougher regulatory scrutiny and its reputation has been damaged as it faces multiple probes.The move to enforce the mandatory arbitration clauses comes as Wells Fargo has launched an advertising campaign to win back customer loyalty in the wake of the scandal.

852,"   By Dan Freed  James Strother, Wells Fargo & Co's (WFC.N) general counsel, who had originally planned to retire at year-end, will stay on indefinitely in the position to deal with fallout from the bank's sales scandal, according to a bank spokesman.""In light of recent events the decision was made to have Jim Strother remain with the company and continue to serve as our general counsel,"" said Peter Gilchrist, a Wells Fargo spokesman.The decision was made by the bank's board of directors and a search is under way for Strother's replacement, Gilchrist said.An email and call to Strother were not returned. The scandal pertains to Wells Fargo opening as many as 2 million accounts in customers' names without their permission. The bank is facing lawsuits from former employees and customers, as well as increased regulatory scrutiny.Strother became the San Francisco-based bank's top lawyer in 2003, and sat behind then-CEO John Stumpf at a bruising congressional hearing about the scandal in September. He has been at Wells Fargo and its predecessor, Norwest Corporation, since 1986.Strother was deeply involved in Wells Fargo's acquisition of Wachovia during the 2008 financial crisis. He also keeps a close eye on compliance issues, something that is not always a general counsel's responsibility. Wells Fargo reached a $190 million regulatory settlement over the phony accounts in September, and parted ways with Stumpf the following month.It is now working to answer questions from politicians and regulators, replace a flawed compensation system that incentivized employees to open phantom accounts, and repair its reputation among customers, including municipalities that have cut business ties. Because he turned 65 this year, Strother would ordinarily be required to retire at the end of the year, according to an internal policy at Wells Fargo affecting members of the bank's operating committee.However, the bank occasionally makes exceptions to this rule in extraordinary situations.

853,"   By Suzanne Barlyn  Legislation introduced by two Democratic lawmakers on Thursday would allow Wells Fargo & Co customers to go to court, instead of private arbitration, to resolve claims about accounts opened without authorization, according to a media release.The bill, which faces an uphill battle in Congress, is a challenge to Wells' effort to force plaintiffs in a lawsuit involving unauthorized accounts to resolve claims in closed-door arbitration proceedings.Wells, in a September settlement with the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other regulators, agreed to pay $185 million in penalties and $5 million to customers for opening up to 2 million deposit and credit-card accounts in their names without their permission.The Justice for Victims of Fraud Act of 2016, introduced by Senate Banking Committee Ranking Minority Member Sherrod Brown from Ohio and Representative Brad Sherman from California, takes aim at mandatory arbitration clauses in Wells Fargo account-opening agreements. Wells Fargo's agreements prohibit customers from joining class actions or suing the bank. Instead, they require individual, closed-door arbitration.The bill would allow individuals who had accounts opened without permission to sue Wells Fargo in court, even if they signed arbitration agreements for other legitimate Wells Fargo accounts, according to a statement from the lawmakers.Wells, on November 23, filed a motion in a U.S. District Court in Utah, asking a judge to order plaintiffs suing the bank about the accounts to resolve their disputes in private arbitrations instead of in court. The case was the first class action lawsuit filed against Wells since settling with regulators.Wells Fargo is providing free mediation services to resolve disputes, a spokesman said in a statement.  ""If a resolution is not reached, the arbitration clause...allows for a forum in which a customer has his or her dispute heard and resolved quickly and efficiently within a neutral, third-party legal process,"" the spokesman said.Last year, a court dismissed an earlier lawsuit against Wells Fargo, saying that customers had signed arbitration clauses when opening legitimate accounts.

854,"   By Ross Kerber and Dan Freed  Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) said on Thursday its board had amended bylaws to require that the bank separate the chairman and chief executive roles, a win for activists who had pressed for the change after a scandal over unauthorized customer accounts.The amendment also calls for the chairman and vice chairman of the board to be independent directors, and provides an annual retainer of $250,000 for the chairman and $100,000 for the vice chairman.Investors, including the state treasurers of Connecticut and Illinois, had filed a resolution calling on the bank to require an independent board chair.. The investors said the bank needs stronger oversight after it emerged in September that thousands of Wells' branch staff had opened as many as 2 million accounts without customers' consent to meet sales targets. The scandal led to the departure of former Chairman and Chief Executive John Stumpf on Oct. 12. President and Chief Operating Officer Tim Sloan replaced Stumpf as CEO, while lead independent director Stephen Sanger became chairman.  ""We believe formalizing this structure is the right decision at this time for the company and its investors, customers, and team members,"" Sanger said in a press release.Wells Fargo reached a $190 million regulatory settlement over the unauthorized accounts, though other government inquiries and investor lawsuits are still outstanding.Tim Smith, who leads shareholder engagement efforts at Walden Asset Management, which represents one of the filers of the shareholder resolution, said investors planned to withdraw it in response to the bank's action on Thursday. Of the new bylaw, Smith said via e-mail, ""We believe this is a best governance practice and empowers the Board in its role of overseeing management on behalf of investors.""It is common among the largest U.S. banks to combine the chairman and CEO jobs, as at JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), despite frequent pressure from activists to break up the jobs in the wake of the stumbles. Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) split up the titles after the financial crisis, then unilaterally changed its bylaws in 2014 to give CEO Brian Moynihan the chairman's title and held a shareholder vote the following year that authorized the change.A spokesman for Wells Fargo referred questions about the bylaw change to public relations firm Sard Verbinnen, which declined to comment.

855,"  NEW YORK Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) said it will continue to offer individual retirement accounts that pay brokers commissions and will adjust procedures to comply with a new U.S. financial regulation that requires companies to put clients' interests first, according to a memo sent to staff on Thursday.Wells became the latest bank brokerage to announce plans to adopt the U.S. Department of Labor's fiduciary rule, set to take effect in April. The regulation aims to eliminate conflicts of interest in the financial advice Americans receive on retirement accounts by requiring firms to change how brokers get paid.While there is some question as to whether industry groups or Republicans will succeed in delaying the start date of the rule, Wells Fargo's rivals Bank of America Corp's (BAC.N) Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) have already started making changes to comply with the rule. In the memo, Wells Fargo said it plans to continue offering commissions-paying accounts in a way that complies with the rule's ""best interest contract exemption,"" which allows firms to keep commissions-paying retirement products if they provide greater disclosure about fees to clients. The bank said it will provide more information on specific adjustments in the coming weeks, according to the memo. Merrill Lynch plans to discontinue retirement accounts that pay brokers commissions, while Morgan Stanley will keep offering commissions-paying accounts under the best interest contract exemption. Morgan Stanley has said it will meet the standards set by the new regulation by retraining brokers, having clients sign additional disclosure contracts, and adding new supervisory software.

857,"   By Patrick Rucker | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON A U.S. bank regulator is ready to fail Wells Fargo on a national scorecard for community lending, sources familiar with the decision said on Wednesday, in a move that could limit near-term expansion for the bank.Wells Fargo is due to be deemed a bank that ""needs to improve"" under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), a law meant to promote lending to poor neighborhoods. The move is a two-notch downgrade from the ""outstanding"" tag Wells Fargo has held since 2008 and the change would give regulators a greater say on day-to-day matters like whether they may open new branches.The ruling from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the main regulator for national banks, is due by early January, said the sources with knowledge of the plans.A Wells Fargo spokesperson declined to comment. A spokesman for the OCC also declined to comment. Wells Fargo has struggled since September to overcome its admission that employees wrongly created as many as 2 million accounts without customer authorization.A downgrade on the bank's community service score could further tarnish the reputation of the San Francisco-based lender at a time when it hopes to move beyond the scandal.Wells Fargo may win an appeal to the downgrade through an independent arm of the regulator but no decision has yet been made, said sources familiar with the process. Consumer advocates have faulted the OCC for letting eight years pass between reviewing Wells Fargo's commitment to community development.""Regulators could have downgraded Wells Fargo years ago and maybe that would have stopped some of this wrongdoing,"" said Paulina Gonzalez, head of the California Reinvestment Coalition. Following the 2008 housing market collapse, the OCC faulted several national banks for their community lending.Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) lost its ""outstanding"" grade in 2011 when the OCC faulted the lender for ""discriminatory or other illegal credit practices."" JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) also slipped one notch from ""outstanding"" to ""satisfactory"" in 2013.But industry and regulatory sources said they knew of no other case where a national bank had slipped two notches in a single review of CRA compliance.

858,"   By Dan Freed  Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) will see a near-term profit hit because of the sharp rise in interest rates, Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan said on Tuesday.The news may be somewhat surprising to investors, who have been bidding up shares of Wells Fargo and other banks in part because of the view that they are likely to benefit from rising interest rates. Ten-year treasury yields have risen to 2.38 percent on Tuesday from 1.78 percent on Nov. 4. Wells Fargo shares are up some 23 percent over the same period.Speaking at an investor conference, Sloan said the bank will, however, benefit in the longer term from rising interest rates. In the short term, certain securities the bank owns have declined in value, Sloan said. He said the bank is also likely to see its results negatively impacted from how it accounts for the effectiveness of its hedges due to the rate rise and currency fluctuations. While Sloan did not specify how big the impact on reported results would be, he pointed for comparison to a $379 million first-quarter hedge accounting gain from a sharp decline in interest rates and foreign currency moves.""So far interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations have moved even more than in Q1, and in the opposite direction,"" he said.

859,"   By Dan Freed  Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) Chairman Stephen Sanger and Vice Chair Elizabeth Duke have been named to a four-member committee that will lead an internal investigation into the bank's recent sales scandal, a person familiar with the matter said on Thursday.Rounding out the special committee's leadership, the person said, are Enrique Hernandez, chair of the board of directors' risk committee, and Donald James, a director who sits on the board's finance and risk committees.The source asked not to be identified as the full make-up of the committee has not been made public. All the directors of the special committee are independent in that they do not work for the company in an operational sense.Law firm Shearman & Sterling and the board's human resources committee will also work on the investigation, according to an announcement by Wells Fargo's board on Sept. 27. The human resources committee has five directors, including Sanger and James. A spokesman for Wells Fargo declined to comment and Sard Verbinnen, which represents the board, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Wells Fargo saw its shares battered in September and October following a $190 million settlement with two regulators and the City Attorney of Los Angeles over the creation of as many as 2 million accounts set up without customers' authorization.  The bank fired 5,300 branch employees over the matter, which also led to the resignation of former Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf. A host of investigations and lawsuits are still pending.Sanger, a former CEO of General Mills Inc (GIS.N), has served on Wells Fargo's board since 2003, while Duke, a former member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, has been a director since 2015. Both the chair and vice chair positions recently received pay increases. The chairman now receives $250,000 annually and the vice chair receives $100,000. The chair used to be paid $60,000 plus separate fees for chairing committees.  According to a Sept. 8 regulatory settlement, problematic sales practices at Wells Fargo go back to at least 2011.

860,"  NEW YORK U.S. insurer Prudential Financial (PRU.N) is investigating whether Wells Fargo (WFC.N) employees signed up customers for its life insurance policies without their knowledge, a spokesman said on Saturday.Sales practices at Wells Fargo have been under a spotlight since September when federal regulators ordered the San Francisco-based bank to pay $190 million in fines and restitution because they said its high pressure sales environment pushed employees to open as many as 2 million deposit and credit card accounts without customers' permission.Prudential has a partnership with Wells Fargo to sell a low-cost life insurance policy, known as MyTerm, to the bank's retail customers.Since bankers are not licensed to sell insurance, Wells Fargo employees were meant to direct customers to either self-service kiosks in branches or online to buy the insurance, without getting into specifics about the products. According to a wrongful termination suit filed in New Jersey state court this week by three former managers in Prudential's corporate investigation division, Wells Fargo employees appear to have signed up bank customers for the Prudential policies without the customers' knowledge or permission.In some cases, policies were opened and closed after a month or two and then reopened, and sometimes monthly fees were withdrawn from the accounts, according to evidence in the lawsuit. Scot Hoffman, a spokesman for Prudential Financial, said the insurer had been monitoring its business with Wells Fargo since last year. A customer survey had shown high lapse rates.The insurer expanded the review of how the product was sold after Wells Fargo was fined in September.""We anticipate reviewing this matter with our regulators in due course,” Hoffman said in a statement. The three managers say they were fired in November for trying to escalate their discoveries internally within Prudential.Hoffman said they were fired for, ""appropriate and legitimate reasons that were entirely unrelated to Prudential’s business with Wells Fargo and Prudential’s decision to examine sales of the MyTerm product."" A spokeswoman for Wells said the bank was investigating any alleged misconduct. ""As we have consistently reinforced, if we identify any instances where a customer received a product they didn’t ask for, we will make it right,"" Mary Eshet, a spokeswoman for the bank said in a statement.The lawsuit and the Prudential investigation were first reported by The New York Times.

Because about 200 of those employees were licensed to sell securities, they fall under the jurisdiction of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the securities industry's self-regulator.   A handful of Wells Fargo employees have sued the bank or filed complaints with regulators saying that they were fired only after they reported on the bogus accounts.In a letter last month to Wells Fargo Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan, Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren, Ron Wyden and Robert Menendez said that evidence they received from FINRA showed that the bank may have filed defamatory statements to retaliate against the employees for questioning the sales tactics.         Financial firms are required to notify FINRA when they terminate securities brokers and to describe why the employee was fired.   The descriptions in the documents can have sweeping impacts on a worker's ability to get hired elsewhere, and employees are supposed to be able to review the document before it is submitted to FINRA.

864,"   By Dan Freed  The top U.S. securities regulator has questioned Wells Fargo & Co over its accounting for a roughly $20 billion portfolio of troubled loans.In a letter sent in September that became public on Tuesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked the bank's controller, Richard Levy, to explain how Wells Fargo went about valuing the portfolio, which it acquired primarily by buying Wachovia.The SEC's questions, which may represent another headache for Wells Fargo following a sales scandal, relate to assumptions the bank made in determining how to value the loans. On a portfolio of so-called ""Pick-a-Pay"" mortgages, for example, the discussion focused on metrics such as borrower credit score and loan-to-value.Those valuation assumptions affect Wells Fargo's earnings in that, when banks acquire distressed assets, they must value them in a way that involves some guesswork about whether the loans will be repaid. The values can rise or fall significantly over time, depending partly on the accuracy of the guesswork, which in turn can lead to gains or losses.In recent months, stock analysts at firms including Keefe, Bruyette & Woods and Credit Suisse have raised questions about whether Wells Fargo's earnings are supported by underlying business growth or accounting maneuvers. In a Sept. 23 note, Credit Suisse's Susan Katzke said the bank's ""shares were pressured by debatable earnings quality,"" even before a sales scandal erupted on Sept. 8, hammering its stock.""There is this sense they are managing earnings and the way you can manage earnings is if you interpret accounting in beneficial ways at the appropriate moments,"" said Charles Peabody, analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading. ""I don't think that is necessarily a bad thing. The problem is that when you get on that treadmill it's hard to get off it."" Wells Fargo's Levy responded to the SEC's questions in detail in an October letter. His response included tables showing how and why values changed over time.In correspondence the next month, the SEC's senior assistant chief accountant, Stephanie Sullivan, said the agency had completed its review.Valuing such loans ""is challenging, and that is the answer that Wells Fargo is offering,"" said Judy Beckman, an accounting professor at the University of Rhode Island.    Spokesmen for the SEC and Wells Fargo declined to comment.    The SEC regularly questions companies on their earnings reports. The regulator sent 2,905 such letters to companies during the 12 month period ended June 30, according to a report from Ernst & Young. In September regulators ordered Wells Fargo to pay $190 million in fines and restitution to settle charges its employees created as many as 2 million deposit and credit card accounts without the consent of customers. The bank faced more trouble on Tuesday when it was the only major U.S. bank that failed to convince regulators it could go bankrupt without causing a major market disruption.

Tuesday's ruling means the bank may not establish international bank entities or acquire non-bank subsidiaries, regulators said.On Tuesday, regulators determined for a second time this year that the Wells Fargo ""living will"" fell short.Wells Fargo is one of eight leading banks that must outline how they would be unwound in an orderly way in bankruptcy. Wells Fargo was one of five banks to fail an initial assessment in April. State Street Corp (STT.N), JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Bank of New York Mellon [BKNYK.UL] and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) passed on Tuesday.Wells Fargo may submit an amended living will by March 31. The restrictions may then be lifted if the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation allow. ""We believe we will be able to address the concerns raised today in the March 2017 revised submission,"" the bank said in a statement.TOO BIG TO FAIL  Living wills were conceived in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis when the downfall of several Wall Street banks sent shockwaves through global markets.U.S. taxpayers had to prop up banks that were deemed ""too big to fail"" and Congress vowed that such a rescue would not happen again.Now that it has failed to satisfy regulators, Wells Fargo is on a regulatory path that could end with the bank being ordered to shrink in two years. The lender will have several chances to harden its business in the meantime and avoid such a measure.Regulators signaled that Wells Fargo's securities and investment banking unit is an area of concern and they threatened to cap its size if Wells cannot right itself.That business has grown increasingly important at the bank, but still accounts for just a fraction of total revenues.

San Francisco-based Wells Fargo reached a settlement with U.S. regulators and the Los Angeles city attorney in September.The Justice Department subpoena directs Guitron to bring all documents related to her employment at Wells, including any related to sales practices, discipline ""or other form of retaliation taken against you by Wells Fargo or Wells Fargo employees.""Guitron and her lawyer were not immediately available for comment. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of California, which issued the subpoena, declined comment.

Former staffers have publicly described a culture where they were pushed into hitting unrealistic sales targets and opened the sham accounts to do so.Wells Fargo chief executive John Stumpf resigned in October after intense questioning before Congress. Beyond the Justice Department probe, Wells Fargo is facing others from various lawmakers and regulators, including a criminal probe by the California attorney general's office.  Guitron and another personal banker, Judi Klosek, filed complaints with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, as well as a joint federal lawsuit in 2010, claiming Wells Fargo retaliated against them for blowing the whistle on similar conduct.Guitron alleged that managers responded by falsifying a paper trail that purported to document her poor performance, forbidding her from taking family medical leave and firing her improperly. A federal judge ultimately dismissed all of Guitron's claims, saying Wells Fargo was justified in firing her because she failed to meet sales quotas and refused to meet with management.
