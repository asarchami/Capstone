0,"   By Julia Fioretti | LONDON  LONDON A celebrated portrait by Francis Bacon of his lover and muse George Dyer could raise up to 30 million pounds ($49 million) on auction in London next month, Christie's said on Wednesday.A Bacon triptych sold last year set an auction record of $142 million.The ""Portrait of George Dyer Talking"" from 1966 is one of the most famous images of Bacon's lover and was exhibited at his Retrospective at the Grand Palais in Paris in 1971, a Christie's statement said.The Irish-born Bacon met Dyer in London's Soho district in 1963, drawn to him by his fragility and need for protection. An anxious, constant smoker and problematic drinker, Dyer went on to dominate Bacon portraits for the rest of the decade. Dyer committed suicide in 1971.The portrait will be offered at the Post-War and Contemporary Art Evening Auction on February 13 in London.""Francis Bacon's position at the forefront of 20th century painting was highlighted at Christie's in November when his triptych of Lucian Freud sold for $142 million and became the most valuable work of art sold at auction,"" said Francis Outred, head of post-war and contemporary art at Christie's. ""It is exciting to be able to follow this success by offering this tour-de-force portrait of George Dyer which presents a powerful portrait of arguably one of Bacon's greatest loves.""Dyer is shown sitting at the center of a revolving room against a backdrop of ""ruby red and luxuriant swathes of lilac"", while his body ""appears to unravel like cotton from a spinning bob"", the Christie's statement said. The tumultuous relationship between Dyer and Bacon was the subject of the 1998 BBC film ""Love Is the Devil: Study for a Portrait of Francis Bacon"", starring Derek Jacobi and Daniel Craig.The ""Portrait of George Dyer Talking"" was last auctioned at Christie's in New York in 2000, raising $6.6 million, a record prize for Bacon at the time.Bacon, famed for his graphically abstract and emotionally raw paintings, existentialist views and hard-drinking, bon vivant lifestyle, died in 1992 at the age of 82.(Editing by Michael Roddy/Mark Heinrich)",2014-01-16,WYNN,"Thu Jan 16, 2014 | 6:55am EST",Bacon portrait of lover seen selling for $49 million at auction,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-art-auction-bacon-idUSBREA0E0YQ20140116?type=companyNews
1,"   By Ross Kerber | BOSTON  BOSTON For some executives, corporate perks are getting just a little less exciting.A number of major U.S. companies are cutting back on glamorous luxuries like personal jet use, country-club memberships, and luxury rentals, recent corporate filings show. Often the shifts follow pressure from shareholders, who in recent years have criticized soaring executive pay and over-the-top perks.But it doesn't mean that the ""extras"" package that comes with a C-suite job is in decline - in many cases the surging value of more mundane freebies like financial planning assistance or life insurance is more than making up the difference.""Companies are really digging in on identifying what areas it makes sense to focus their benefits programs,"" said Robert Newbury, director at pay consulting firm Towers Watson. ""You will see companies spend less on areas that raise red flags with investors.""Take for instance casino mogul Steve Wynn. He began paying out of his own pocket in November for his Las Vegas luxury villa after years during which his company Wynn Resorts Ltd took care of the bill - which was more than $450,000 a year.""The new treatment of Mr. Wynn's villa is part of an overall change of executive compensation to ensure the company is aligned with best-in-market compensation practices,"" Wynn Resorts spokesman Michael Weaver said.At the same time, Wynn - who in December was featured on a ""Truly Outrageous CEO Perks"" list produced by the financial news service 24/7 Wall St because of the villa freebie - saw a company contribution to his insurance and benefits nearly double to $33,293 in 2013 from $18,125 in 2012.And he got ""merchandise discounts"" of $56,196, more than double the $23,057 he received in 2012. The filing did not give more details about what these discounts were for and Weaver declined to comment.For AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson the value of his ""other compensation"" - costs outside of traditional areas like salaries, bonuses and equity awards - dropped 35 percent in 2013 to $522,203, according to its proxy filed last month. The drop was mainly because he now reimburses the company for personal use of AT&T aircraft, a spokesman said.The policy is one of several that AT&T adopted to show ""its commitment to paying for performance and aligning executive pay with stockholder interests,"" the company said in a filing reporting the change in March 2013.The telecom giant has been slowly cracking down on perks in recent years - from 2011 onwards it stopped paying fees for executives' country club memberships. A decline in flying costs could also be seen at Facebook. CEO Mark Zuckerberg's cost for personal use of company aircraft was $650,164 last year, down almost half from $1.2 million in 2012. The aircraft were ""chartered in connection with Mr. Zuckerberg's overall security program,"" Facebook said in a filing, which did not give a reason for the decline. The company declined to comment.CURTAINS OPEN The changes are in line with broader trends in compensation, experts say.Towers Watson, for example, found just 36 percent of Fortune 500 CEOs got company aircraft for personal use in 2012, down from 53 percent in 2007. However, the median value for the personal use of aircraft among those who had the perk was $125,473 in 2012, up from $92,596 in 2007 - likely due to factors like higher fuel prices.""You would have to say this is one of the real successes of the critics of executive pay,"" said pay consultant Alan Johnson. ""They opened the curtains and everyone said, 'Oh my God, why we paying for all this?'""Banks in particular have backed away from perks that brought them heat from lawmakers and regulators as they got bailouts during the financial crisis. Morgan Stanley Inc paid $368,675 for then-CEO John Mack's personal use of company aircraft in 2008. But since then, Mack and his successor James Gorman paid out of their own pockets for such flights. Another Morgan Stanley executive, wealth-management head Gregory Fleming, has received no perks since 2011, a recent filing shows. Fleming worked at Merrill Lynch until 2009, around the time then Merrill CEO John Thain was criticized for a lavish office renovation that included a $35,000 ""commode on legs.""""Greg having lived through the John Thain era … I think that continues to be paramount in everybody's mind,"" said one bank executive close to Fleming.Fleming declined to comment.Still, cutting some of the flashier perks can be more symbolic than anything. Overall executive compensation continued to rise in 2013, though at a slower pace than in previous years, according to a review of early filings.Wynn, for example, made $19.6 million in compensation in 2013, up from $17.7 million in 2012.MUNDANE SPENDING UP  Indeed, about 60 percent of companies that have filed disclosures for 2013 actually raised ""other compensation"" spending, according to compensation data firm Equilar. The trend follows the pattern of past years and may reflect more spending on areas like security and financial planning.Towers Watson's survey last year found the median value of financial and tax planning assistance for CEOs rose to $15,000 in 2012 from $11,180 in 2007, for instance.And not everyone is booking less personal travel to their companies.At Verizon Communications Inc CEO Lowell McAdam got a 46 percent boost in ""other compensation"" to $780,874 in 2013. Of that $120,304 was for personal use of company aircraft, up from $89,467 in 2012. Verizon declined to comment.Nutrition and weight-loss company Herbalife also sharply boosted spending on personal jet use by its CEO Michael Johnson and his family. A company spokesman said the use of a private jet was for the family's personal security.Johnson and Herbalife have been under a lot of pressure from hedge fund manager William Ackman, who has had a big short bet against the company's shares and has accused it publicly of running a pyramid scheme. Herbalife strenuously denies the charge.Another perk is the chance to use a company's products.General Electric Co described a program that provides its home appliances ""upon request"" to top executives and directors. Rival Whirlpool Corp's filing outlined a similar deal for its directors who aren't executives. ""For evaluative purposes, Whirlpool permits non-employee directors to test Whirlpool products for home use,"" the company said in a filing.Also, California chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices Inc listed as gifts to its top executives the costs of Sony PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Xbox One game console systems - with $1,006 worth logged to CEO Rory Read.Both systems use AMD components. Hundreds of other company employees also received game consoles ""to acknowledge their contributions driving our strong financial performance,"" AMD spokesman Drew Prairie said via e-mail.(Reporting by Ross Kerber; additional reporting by Richard Valdmanis, Peter Rudegeair, and Lauren LaCapra; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Martin Howell)",2014-04-04,WYNN,"Fri Apr 4, 2014 | 4:22am EDT","Companies rein in flashy perks, find other rewards for CEOs",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-executives-salary-perks-insight-idUSBREA3308A20140404?type=companyNews
2,"  TOKYO Universal Entertainment Corp (6425.T) and its billionaire founder Kazuo Okada have filed a criminal complaint against Wynn Resorts Ltd (WYNN.O) and its CEO Steve Wynn in Japan on allegations of defamation.The complaint marks the latest salvo in a long-running feud between the two former business partners.Universal said in a statement on Wednesday that it submitted the complaint with the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office on April 24, accusing the U.S. casino operator and its CEO of ""defamation, harm to public trust and circulation of rumors"" in relation to the publication of an investigation into Universal's conduct in the Philippines.The investigation was commissioned by Wynn and made public in early 2012.In an emailed statement, Wynn said the criminal complaint was an attempt by Okada ""to create a distraction from the investigations pending against him"".Wynn said the complaint was related to a previously filed civil defamation case that a Tokyo court, ruling it should not be tried in Japan, dismissed last year. Universal is appealing that ruling.Universal filed the civil defamation case after Wynn published its investigation into Okada in February 2012, alleging his company improperly offered gifts and entertainment to gaming officials in South Korea and the Philippines.Universal has acknowledged spending a total of $110,000 over three years on such outlays, but maintains they did not constitute a violation of U.S. anti-bribery laws. Following the investigation, Wynn said Okada was unsuitable as a director of Wynn Resorts and redeemed Okada's 20 percent stake in Wynn Resorts at a discount.The battle between the former partners has been playing out in courts in the United States, Japan and the Philippines for more than two years.While Universal said in its statement that Tokyo prosecutors had accepted the complaint, it was unclear whether that would translate into an official investigation. To date nothing has come of a similar criminal complaint filed by Okada against Wynn in the Philippines in December 2012.The tussle between Okada and Wynn reaches a critical juncture in the coming days, when a six-month stay on discovery in their U.S. civil proceedings ends.A ""status check"" hearing before Clark County District Judge Elizabeth Gonzales is scheduled for May 8, according to the court's website.Gonzales had put the civil proceedings on hold to allow U.S. prosecutors to continue investigating Okada and his companies for possible bribery in the Philippines.

9,"  (Recasts with request for delay denied)By Elizabeth BarberBOSTON, July 2 Massachusetts gaming regulators unanimously denied a request from Boston's mayor on Wednesday to delay awarding a casino license near the city until November, saying that voters have the right to know where the casino will be built before heading to the polls.Mayor Marty Walsh had proposed putting the Boston-area casino licensing process on hold after the state's highest court ruled last week to allow a vote on whether to repeal the 2011 law that permitted three casinos to be licensed in the state. Eugene O'Flaherty, a lawyer for the city, said at the hearing on Wednesday that Boston could end up having ""needlessly expended significant amounts of money, time and effort"" trying to negotiate compensation agreements with casino giants Mohegan Sun and Wynn Resorts Ltd if voters go on to repeal the law allowing casinos.But officials on the Massachusetts Gaming Commission said state residents are entitled to know where the Boston-area casino will be built before voting in the fall. ""The voters will make their judgment with better information,"" commissioner Enrique Zuniga said.Commissioner James McHugh accused Boston of making repeated unilateral decisions in the casino licensing process, saying the city might seek to block the casino proposals regardless of the outcome of the referendum. Boston officials contend they are entitled to hold a citywide vote on casino projects in neighboring cities, which are closely linked to Boston.Voters in East Boston last year rejected a proposed casino backed by Caesars Entertainment Corp. Two casinos projects for cities abutting Boston - a Mohegan Sun development in Revere and Wynn's proposal in Everett - have since gone forward in the competition for the sole license available in eastern Massachusetts. The commission had been set to approve one of the two projects by September.Only one of the three casino licenses has been awarded, to Las Vegas developer MGM Resorts International, with formal licensing on hold pending the referendum.

10,"   By Elizabeth Barber | BOSTON, July 2  BOSTON, July 2 Boston's mayor is due to ask Massachusetts gaming regulators on Wednesday to put off awarding a casino license near the city until November, after a statewide ballot initiative on repealing the law allowing casinos in the state.Mayor Marty Walsh proposed putting the casino licensing process on hold following a ruling last week by the state's highest court allowing a vote on whether to repeal the 2011 law that permitted three casinos to be licensed in the state. The Massachusetts Gaming Commission will hear his case and possibly vote on it at a Wednesday meeting. Walsh has said it would be a poor use of time to try to negotiate compensation agreements with casino giants Mohegan Sun and Wynn Resorts Ltd, who are each vying to build a casino in neighboring cities, if state voters go on to repeal the law allowing casinos.""Given the uncertainty of expanded gaming in Massachusetts, the city emphasized that a stay was necessary to save the City from incurring considerable expenditure of time, money, and effort in connection with the ongoing proceedings,"" the city said in a legal brief submitted to the commission. Voters in East Boston last year rejected a proposed casino backed by Caesars Entertainment Corp. Two casino projects for cities abutting Boston - a Mohegan Sun development in Revere and Wynn's proposal in Everett - have since gone forward in the competition for the sole license available in eastern Massachusetts. The commission had been set to approve one of the two projects by September.Only one of the three casino licenses has been awarded, to Las Vegas developer MGM Resorts International, with formal licensing on hold pending the referendum.

Chanos and Kynikos Associates LP did not immediately respond on Friday to requests for comment.In the complaint, Wynn also said that he and Wynn Resorts have been ""thoroughly investigated"" on numerous occasions by gaming regulators in Nevada and Massachusetts, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and other government agencies, and that no official agency has identified reliable evidence of an FCPA violation.The complaint did not quote from the alleged slander or provide any surrounding context. ""When untrue statements about our company are made, we are vigilant in defending our reputation,"" Wynn Resorts spokesman Michael Weaver said in a statement. ""We have no further comment about our legal strategy.""Wynn's lawyer declined to comment.In July 2013, Wynn Resorts said the SEC decided to take no enforcement action after probing an allegation by Japanese billionaire Kazuo Okada that the company may have violated the FCPA by donating $135 million to a university in Macau, a major gambling hub where Wynn Resorts operates. Wynn Resorts forcibly redeemed Okada's 20 percent stake in the company in February 2012, accusing Okada of making improper payments to Philippine officials to advance a $2 billion casino project there. Okada and Wynn have traded allegations of illegal conduct in more than two years of U.S. litigation.On May 15, Chanos told CNBC television that he would ""no longer be long the Macau casinos,"" but declined to say whether he was conducting short sales related to Macau.Short-selling, which involves the sale of borrowed shares and subsequent repurchase, is a bet that a stock's price will go down.Chanos is known for having shorted Enron Corp stock many months before the energy trader's December 2001 bankruptcy.Wynn is worth $3.5 billion, Forbes magazine said on Friday.The case is Wynn et al v.

21,"   By Scott Malone | BOSTON  BOSTON Oct 4 Since high school, Lorita Lindemann has lived to the rhythm of horse racing - rising before dawn to tend her thoroughbred charges, cheering as they thunder down the track and working into the night to prepare them to compete again.As Boston's 79-year-old Suffolk Downs prepares to close on Saturday, a victim of declining attendance and online gambling, Lindemann and hundreds of trainers, grooms and jockeys face losing not just their jobs but also a way of life.""The horses need you 365 days a year. No holidays, no vacations,"" Lindemann, 40, said. ""The horses keep you single.""Many of her friends who make their living in the cluster of stables around the one-mile (1.6-km) Depression-era track, where Seabiscuit made his debut in 1935, cling to hopes that the track can be saved.An independent group, the New England Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Association, on Wednesday made a last-gasp pitch to the Massachusetts Gaming Commission to run Suffolk Downs next year. If the state rules in its favor by Nov. 15, the track could reopen.Suffolk Downs' decline underscores the decades-long waning of interest in horse racing in the United States. With attendance at the track in decline since the 1990s, officials have cut the racing calendar by more than half, to 65 dates a year from about 150.A few big tracks, such as Kentucky's Churchill Downs and New York's Belmont Park and Saratoga, attract the bulk of the fans and the bets. Across the United States, betting from the ground at thoroughbred race tracks has dropped by more than half, to $1.19 billion in 2013, down from $2.94 billion in 1996, according to data from the Jockey Club, which collects racing statistics.But the value of bets placed from afar, many of which go to the largest tracks, has risen by about $1 billion in that time. That partly offsets the total decline in betting on horses, which was $10.88 billion in 2013, a 6.5 percent drop from 1996.""Once, people would go to Suffolk Downs to watch the races because racing was a local thing,"" said Andrew Beyer, a journalist who has followed horse racing for decades and has written four books on the sport.""Now a horse player in New England is going to be much more interested in playing the races in New York or other major circuits,"" he said. CASINO BET Suffolk Downs had hoped to win one of the three Massachusetts casino licenses created by state lawmakers in 2011. A resort hotel with gambling, officials believed, would draw in new horse racing fans and help prop up the track financially. But the track lost out in its bid to a proposal by Las Vegas developer Wynn Resorts Ltd. Last month officials said Saturday would be the last day of racing.Some 850 people will lose their jobs, a figure that includes vendors, ticket takers and back-office staff as well as those who work with the horses.For the trainers and other horse people - many of whom took to the sport as children, have little more than a high school education and few other skills - a life that does not revolve around caring for their animals is a frightening prospect.""I tried a normal job, but it was not for me,"" said jockey Janelle Campbell, who started coming to track at the age of 8 when her aunt, Tammi Piermarini, also a jockey, began showing her around. ""I'll just have to find another track to ride at.""Cathy Chumbley, 65, spent a drizzly Thursday morning at the track with 19-year-old horse Dennis the Menace in her post as an outrider, charged with monitoring track safety and coming to the assistance of jockeys or horses in the event of an accident.The job was a late-career downshift for both Chumbley, who previously worked as a trainer, and Dennis, who used to race.""In horse racing, you just scale down, you don't retire,"" said Chumbley. ""It's scary. I was hoping to work another five to 10 years.""

30,"   By James Saft  Big fish Chinese gamblers afraid of a corruption crackdown and poorly paid Walmart workers in the United States might seem to have little in common.But in the global economy, they are in some ways two sides of the same coin, and to understand that is to understand more than why the two disparate groups were blamed for horrendous earnings at two very different companies: Walmart and Wynn Resorts.The globalization of the past 25 years has been kind to both companies, as cheap labor from China became integrated in the global economy, creating, among many phenomena, great new wealth in China and a buyer’s market for labor in the United States.Now we may be seeing the early stages of a partial reversal of some of those trends, as China seeks a new economic model and politics and economics in the United States are giving wage earners more bargaining power.Walmart's stock is down more than 12 percent since it said on Wednesday that earnings would fall 6-12 percent this year, a decline it blamed in part on higher wage bills. The retailer said in April it was bumping hourly pay up to at least $9 for all U.S. employees, with another dollar-per-hour hike to come in February. Overall, Walmart says it will spend $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion on higher wages and training next year.Wynn Resorts has a very different species of problem: too few Chinese high-rollers willing to be seen betting fortunes on the flip of a card. Not only are more gamblers now in fear of a crackdown on corruption underway in China, but President Xi Jinping’s efforts are creating a hostile environment for casinos in formerly wide-open Macau.“In my 45 years of experience, I’ve never seen anything like this before,” Wynn CEO Steve Wynn said on Thursday, describing the difficulty of what he called an “almost mystical” planning process on the Chinese-administered island.Wynn Resorts said profits fell more than a dollar per share to just 86 cents, driven by a 38 percent fall in Macau revenue and a near halving of the VIP junket business that brings rich gamblers to the tables from the Chinese mainland. Wynn shares, down more than 50 percent thus far this year, fell sharply in Asian trading before recovering somewhat the following day in U.S. hours.BUSINESS MODELS Gambling in Macau, to be sure, is particularly vulnerable to a number of trends in China. Not only is an economic slowdown hitting the cash flow of those who gamble, but the corruption crackdown has taken particular aim at the industry. So-called junkets, short trips to Macau, are seen both as a symbol of corruption and a means for officials and others to launder cash or simply to evade Chinese capital controls.Still both businesses - Walmart and Wynn Resorts - had business models that were part beneficiaries of and partly predicated on long-running global trends. As China rose, integrating its huge and underutilized labor force into the global economy, its share of world trade rose from less than 3 percent in 1990 to 12 percent today.Great wealth was created, both in China and the rest of the world.Macau, gambling and Wynn all were beneficiaries of occupying an intermediate space between tightly controlled capital and the rest of the world. Gamblers had good reason not just to want to live a little, but to want to get a bit offshore.On the other side of the world, Walmart did well out of selling goods, many of them made in China, cheaply to a middle- and lower-income clientele whose incomes were being whittled away in real terms as U.S. manufacturing jobs went offshore. Those U.S. workers were both keen to find a bargain and, lacking better-paid options, willing to work for comparatively little.China now is at or past a demographic tipping point, with little excess labor to absorb. The plan instead: to move toward a more domestically focused, consumer-based economy. That change ultimately may be successful, but in the meantime China sees the need to crack down on arrangements and practices, like the junkets, that it previously tolerated.Walmart, conversely, finds itself also affected by the same mega-trend of an aging China. Not only has U.S. unemployment fallen, potentially giving workers more negotiating power, but after decades of falling real wages, the U.S. political debate has changed, with more pressure for higher minimum wages.In other words, as surplus labor supply dries up in China and elsewhere, largely for demographic reasons, business models everywhere will come under pressure. Lower margins are likely for labor-intensive U.S. companies, and the pie will be divided differently, with different winners and losers in China.(James Saft is a Reuters columnist.

43,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, May 24 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Issuer Default Ratings  (IDRs) of Wynn Resorts, Ltd (WYNN) and all of its subsidiaries rated by Fitch at  'BB'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. The subsidiaries affirmed include Wynn Las  Vegas, LLC (Wynn Las Vegas), Wynn America, LLC (Wynn America), Wynn Macau, Ltd  (Wynn Macau) and Wynn Resorts (Macau), S.A. Fitch links all of the IDRs within  the WYNN corporate structure. The full list of rating actions is at the end of  this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch's affirmation of WYNN and the Stable Outlook reflect our view that WYNN  has a relatively clear glide path to reduce leverage to levels more commensurate  with its 'BB' IDR by 2019, by which time Wynn Palace will be ramped up and Wynn  Boston Harbor will be open a full year. Fitch forecasts 2019 consolidated gross  and net leverage at 6.0x and 4.5x, respectively, declining further to 5.6x and  3.9x by 2020. Fitch's forecast leverage metrics are solid for 'BB' IDR taking  into account WYNN's more diversified market exposure after the project  completions and the exceptional asset and brand quality of its asset portfolio.  In the interim, leverage will be high (net leverage above 6x) and there is  minimal cushion in the credit profile to absorb further operating deterioration  or WYNN ramping up shareholder-friendly activity. Fitch will focus more on WYNN's net leverage as opposed to gross leverage  through the development of Wynn Boston Harbor. Since first quarter 2015 (1Q15),  WYNN maintained $1 billion or more cash at the parent level (a partly  debt-funded distribution from Wynn Las Vegas helped establish the cash cushion).  Parent cash was $1.2 billion as of March 31, 2016, an increase from $1 billion  at March 31, 2015 with the increase coinciding with WYNN's reduction of its  parent-level dividends by about $400 million per year in response to the  weakness in Macau. Fitch recognizes the risk that WYNN may use the parent cash  to ramp up shareholder-friendly initiatives but, nevertheless, expects cash at  the parent level to remain high by historical standards (parent cash on average  was around $500 million 2006-2014).  Fitch's leverage forecasts assume modest increases in the parent level  dividends, minimal debt repayment and $2.9 billion of cash at the parent level  by year-end 2020. Absent better than expected operating performance, Fitch  gaining greater clarity with respect to the utilization of cash will be key to  maintaining WYNN's IDR at 'BB'. A prioritization of cash for debt reduction  and/or as a liquidity buffer will be consistent with the 'BB' IDR. Conversely,  cash depletion (or additional borrowing) related to share repurchases, special  dividends or the company taking on large-scale projects could pressure the IDR.   The affirmation also takes into account WYNN's history of taking bold measures  to shore up its balance sheet. Besides WYNN's recent dividend cut, other notable  actions include selling over $2 billion in equity through secondary offerings  since its 2002 IPO, including two issuances during the bottom of the last  recession, and passing on Singapore in order to focus on its developments in  Macau and Las Vegas.  DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE Fitch is positive on WYNN's existing development pipeline, which helps to  support Fitch's affirmation of the 'BB' IDR. Once complete, the projects will  provide for an operating mix more comparable to WYNN's global gaming peers  including Genting Berhad ('A-' IDR), MGM Resorts ('BB' IDR), and Las Vegas Sands  ('BBB-' IDR). Fitch's positive view on the development pipeline does not take  into account Wynn Paradise Park, which is yet to be approved by WYNN's board.  Wynn Boston Harbor will provide WYNN with diversification away from Macau and  Las Vegas and a near monopoly in a gateway metropolitan area. Fitch estimates  that Wynn Boston Harbor will make up 15% of WYNN's property EBITDA by 2019. It  will be the closest casino to the city of Boston, five miles from the Logan  International Airport, with the next-closest casinos about 40 miles south. Penn  National's slots-only Plainridge Park Casino opened in 2015 and Mashpee  Wampanoag Tribe's First Light Resort & Casino started construction in April 2016  and is backed by Genting Berhad.  The First Light casino will benefit from a 15% gaming tax compared to WYNN's  25%, which will provide First Light with a cost advantage to market more  aggressively to more distant and/or less valuable customers. Fitch's $315  million EBITDA forecast for Wynn Boston Harbor assumes Wynn's market share at  20%-60% in the counties closest to First Light and Plainridge and 85%-90% in  counties west and north of Boston. Fitch's forecast does not give Wynn Boston  Harbor any credit for international business that the casino could capture,  considering the proximity to Logan and WYNN's global marketing outreach.  Fitch believes that the $4.2 billion Wynn Palace will outperform other casino  developments on Cotai. Fitch attributes $370 million of incremental EBITDA to  Wynn Palace relative to the $100 million - $200 million Fitch attributes to  competitors' Macau projects. Fitch's stronger confidence in Wynn Palace takes  into account WYNN's ability to transfer underutilized resources to Cotai from  Peninsula including approximately 50 tables and $100 million of annualized labor  costs. Fitch also factors in Wynn Macau's relatively healthy mass market  utilization statistics thoughout the recent downturn. Wynn Macau's RevPAR is  only 7% lower relative to the peak level attained in 1H14 and remains high  relative to other Macau operators at $307 as of 1Q16. Mass market win per table  per day declined by 38% during this time, which is decent considering the number  of mass table games at Wynn Macau increased by 28% and market-wide mass market  revenues declined by about 30%.  Fitch's forecast assumes that WYNN's Macau gaming revenue market share increases  to about 13% by 2018 compared to 10% in 2010 and that Macau's market-wide gaming  revenue will decline by 5% in 2016 and will grow 6% thereafter. Fitch's Macau  forecast is conservative relative to WYNN's middle-case scenario estimate  discussed at April's investor day of approximately $650 million in incremental  EBITDA.  CREDIT RISKS In April 2016, the company increased its share buyback authorization by $420  million to $1 billion and announced its Wynn Paradise Park concept. While no  firm commitment exists for either initiative, both are viewed as potential  sources of credit risk by Fitch. Absent stronger than expected operating  performance in Las Vegas or Macau (most notably as it relates to the Wynn Palace  opening), large-scale repurchases could put pressure on WYNN's IDR, since Fitch  views WYNN's significant parent-level cash position as being a critical buttress  for the 'BB' IDR.  Buybacks would be a departure from using special dividends as an opportunistic  method of returning value to shareholders. On their 1Q16 call, management said  the purpose of the larger authorization was to increase flexibility to buy back  stock if the company though it was 'grossly over-sold'.    Wynn Paradise Park is an expansion of Wynn Las Vegas. The project is yet to be  approved by Wynn's board but management stated that the cost could be around  $1.5 billion. Wynn Paradise Park may include a 1,000-room hotel tower and a  recreational lake built where the golf course currently stands. The company's  management hopes to present the project at a July board meeting and no details  were provided as to the financing or timing.  WYNN proceeding with the project in the near term (i.e. 2016 or early 2017)  would be viewed negatively by Fitch given the company's thin cushion in the  credit profile relative to the 'BB' IDR to absorb another major project  developed parallel with Wynn Boston Harbor. Further, Wynn Paradise Park's  opening may coincide with 4,200 rooms potentially coming online across the  street when Genting's Resorts World Las Vegas and Crown's Alon open around 2019  (no official opening time has been announced for either project). If WYNN  proceeds with Wynn Paradise Park, Fitch will consider the project's timing,  cost, and the return on investment (ROI) prospects before considering rating  action.  An older risk is Kazuo Okada's lawsuit against WYNN related to the 2012  redemption of Okada's shares. The par amount of the promissory note Okada  received for his shares is $830 million below the market value of the redeemed  shares. Related to the Okada suit, which remains in the discovery phase, the  U.S. Department of Justice is looking into WYNN's donation to the University of  Macau. Prior investigations into the donation matter by the Nevada Gaming  Control Board and SEC were closed with no actions taken. IDRs LINKED Fitch links all of the IDRs within the WYNN corporate complex. The main  rationale is that all of WYNN's assets are strategically critical to the company  due to the cross-branding and marketing and that WYNN has the flexibility to  move cash freely between the subsidiaries. Financial covenants at WYNN's  subsidiaries do not materially restrict dividends. WYNN Las Vegas mortgage notes  have a distribution basket that equals 100% EBITDA minus 1.4x interest expense,  which roughly equals its FCF that will be used to help fund Wynn Boston Harbor.  The mortgage notes will be callable early next year. In Macau, a leverage  covenant governs dividends and Fitch estimates that WYNN is well within the  relevant threshold. The tax WYNN pays on Macau gaming revenues is counted as a  foreign tax credit in the U.S.; therefore, cash movement out of Macau is not a  material tax event for WYNN.  MARKET OUTLOOKS Fitch forecasts negative 5% market-wide gaming revenue growth in Macau for 2016,  which assumes modest sequential growth in the mass market and leaves room for  continued but milder weakness in the VIP segment. We expect WYNN to consolidate  market share in Macau with its Wynn Palace opening in 3Q16 and grow revenues at  a faster pace than the market in 2016 and 2017. Past that, Fitch expects  mid-single-digit growth in Macau led by China's rising middle class, the new  capacity in Macau and infrastructure projects in and around Macau.  In Las Vegas we expect the growing convention business, increasing air capacity  and lack of new room supply to drive RevPAR higher in the near term. Fitch  beleives that Crown's and Genting's projects are long-term positives for WYNN as  they would help to pull the center of gravity more north and away from Caesars  and MGM properties that are clustered towards the south. However, these projects  could place temporary pressure on WYNN's RevPAR as the market absorbs the new  capacity.  LAS VEGAS ISSUE SPECIFIC RATINGS Fitch rates Wynn Las Vegas' first mortgage notes (FMNs) due 2022 'BB+/RR2', a  notch above Wynn Las Vegas' IDR and the senior unsecured notes. The one-notch  uplift reflects the FMNs' springing lien, which kicks in if Wynn Las Vegas  grants a lien to other debt at Wynn Las Vegas. The unsecured notes have a  springing lien if the 2022 FMNs become secured or if Wynn Las Vegas grants a  lien to other debt in an amount greater than 15% of assets. The FMNs, which  carry a modest coupon but contain restrictive covenants, become callable at  102.688 in March 2017. If WYNN opts to call the FMNs, it can issue up to around  $450 million of secured debt per its unsecured notes' lien basket.   KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for WYNN include: --Las Vegas revenues grow about 1%-2% per year with margins staying at around  30%; --Wynn Macau generating about $1.075 billion of EBITDA in 2017, which factors in  about $580 million EBITDA at Wynn Palace and approximately 30% EBITDA decline at  the Peninsula property; --Approximately $320 million EBITDA at Wynn Boston Harbor in 2019;  --WYNN does not repurchase shares or develop Wynn Paradise Park. Regular parent  level dividends start to increase by about $100 million per year starting in  2018 with excess cash being accumulated at the parent level. RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include:  --Gross and net leverage sustaining above 5x and 4x, respectively, following the  opening of Wynn Boston Harbor; --Depletion of parent-level cash driven by shareholder-friendly activity, which  may include significant share buybacks, a sharp increase in dividends, or major  equity contributions to fund new developments;  --WYNN moving forward with Wynn Paradise Park, with negative rating action  parameters set around timing, cost, funding and a better clarity of the ROI  prospects; --Adverse resolution with respect to the Okada litigation; --Worse than expected operating performance in Las Vegas or Macau with more  acute sensitivity around the ramp-up of Wynn Palace.  Positive rating action is unlikely in the near term given WYNN's high leverage  but Fitch may consider an upgrade to 'BB+' as gross leverage starts to approach  4x and after net leverage sustains below 4x. Better than expected ramp up of  Wynn Palace, a favorable resolution to the Okada dispute and WYNN publically  articulating financial targets consistent with Fitch's upgrade thresholds could  accelerate the upgrade. LIQUIDITY WYNN's liquidity is strong. The company has $2.1 billion of cash, of which Fitch  estimates $200 million is used for cage-cash purposes. In addition, WYNN has  $252 million of investment securities, mostly short-term corporate debt.  Wynn Palace will open in July 2016 and thereafter Wynn Macau's cash flows ($600  million - $800 million annually) are free to be distributed to Wynn Resorts and  the minority shareholders. In light of Wynn Boston Harbor's increased budget  (now budgeted at $1.9 billion - $2.1 billion), Fitch estimates that the project  will require some cash contributions from the parent company in addition to the  $1.25 billion Wynn America credit facility and approximately $430 million in  aggregate distributions from Wynn Las Vegas through 2018. Wynn Resorts, the  parent, guarantees the completion of Wynn Boston Harbor and has $1.2 billion in  cash as of March 31, 2016.  There are no maturities until 2019 when Wynn America's $375 revolver matures and  Wynn Macau term loan starts to amortize. In 2020, Wynn America's $875 term loan  matures and the term loan amortization in Macau accelerates. Covenants are not a  concern.  Wynn America has a $200 million minimum EBITDA and 2.75x leverage test and there  is ample cushion relative to Fitch's forecasts for Wynn Boston Harbor. Wynn  Macau's credit facility has a leverage covenant, which is set at 5.5x for  year-end 2016 and 5.25x for year-end 2017. Wynn Macau covenants exclude the  unsecured notes issued by the Hong Kong-listed Wynn Macau, Ltd and Fitch expects  the covenant ratio to remain below 4x throughout Fitch's projection horizon.
