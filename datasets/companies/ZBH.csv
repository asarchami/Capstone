0,"   By Jessica Dye  Zimmer, an Indiana-based medical device manufacturer, is set to face the first trial amid nearly 1,000 lawsuits in federal court alleging that its NexGen Flex knee implants have a defect that make them prone to loosening, which can cause pain and a loss of movement. The trial for plaintiff Kathy Batty is scheduled to begin Tuesday before U.S. District Judge Rebecca Pallmeyer in the Northern District of Illinois, who presides over multidistrict litigation involving Zimmer's NexGen Flex knees.

1,  WASHINGTON Oct 19 The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday agreed to consider whether a $70 million jury award that Stryker Corp won against Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc for patent infringement should be tripled.The justices agreed to hear an appeal filed by Stryker after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said last December that the award should not be tripled. The court said Stryker had failed to show that the infringement of its patents for a surgical cleaning wand was willful.  The court also agreed to hear another case on the same issue in which Halo Electronics Inc is seeking triple damages from Pulse Electronics Corp for infringing its patents relating to circuit board transformers.

2,"   By Jessica Dye  Indiana-based medical device manufacturer Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc on Friday was cleared of liability in the first of more than 900 U.S. lawsuits to go to trial over claims that its NexGen Flex knee replacements were prone to painful, motion-impairing loosening.Following a three-week trial in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, jurors returned a verdict for Zimmer in the lawsuit brought by Kathy Batty, according to Zimmer spokeswoman Monica Kendrick.Batty, who suffers from degenerative joint disease, underwent a total knee replacement on both knees in 2009 using Zimmer's NexGen Flex system. Within a year, she said she began to experience severe pain, leading her to replace the implants in 2011. She and other plaintiffs had accused the company of designing a flawed product and failing to warn doctors about its potential risks. While the outcome of Batty's trial will not be binding on other cases, it is a critical early win for Zimmer in the consolidated federal litigation, which currently contains more than 900 cases. The victory is particularly significant because lead plaintiffs' lawyers had selected Batty's case for the first trial, signaling their belief that it was one of the ""strongest cases in this litigation,"" Kendrick said in a statement.Kendrick said the company was pleased with the verdict and looked forward to defending its NexGen Flex products ""in as many trials as are necessary."" Lead lawyers for Batty did not immediately return requests for comment. Zimmer's NexGen Flex was cleared for sale by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2007, and was designed to offer greater flexibility than standard knee devices.Plaintiffs said the marketing for the devices falsely implied that patients could engage in activities involving frequent knee flexing, when in fact the devices could not withstand the additional force and strain. They said that a flaw in the NexGen Flex design could cause it to loosen prematurely, requiring additional surgery to fix or replace. Zimmer has denied that the devices are defective and said they have a successful track record. It argued that Batty's alleged injuries may have been caused by other factors, such as infection.Zimmer Holdings Inc's $14 billion purchase of rival device maker Biomet was approved earlier this year, creating Zimmer Biomet.The case is Batty v.

14,"   By Andrew Chung | NEW YORK, June 13  NEW YORK, June 13 The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday said federal judges should have more discretion to boost penalties in patent infringement cases and ordered a lower appeals court to review whether Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc  willfully violated Stryker Corp patents on a surgical cleaning wand.In a unanimous opinion, the high court also ordered the appeals court in a separate case to review whether Pulse Electronics Corp willfully infringed Halo Electronics Inc's patents. The justices said that a test developed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., the nation's top patent court, was too rigid and allowed some egregious infringers to escape liability. Industry groups were closely following the cases because lowering the bar for judges to award enhanced damages could hand patent owners a potent new weapon to file infringement cases and push for licenses.

27,"   By Brendan Pierson  Medical device maker Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc has asked a federal appeals court to vacate a decision reinstating a jury's finding that Zimmer willfully infringed rival Stryker Corp's patents on a surgical cleaning wand. In a brief filed Wednesday in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, Zimmer cited a June Supreme Court ruling that set out a new standard giving judges more discretion in finding willfulness. Zimmer said it should have a chance to defend itself against Stryker's claim of willfulness under the new standard.

While traders doubt the Fed will raise interest rates this week, they will be looking for signs to firm up their convictions for a hike at the central bank's December meeting.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.08-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.07-to-1 ratio favored decliners.The S&P 500 posted 7 new 52-week highs and 6 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 37 new highs and 101 new lows.",2016-10-31,ZBH,"Mon Oct 31, 2016 | 3:23pm EDT","US STOCKS-Wall St treads water amid election doubts, M&A flurry",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-stocks-idUSL1N1D11FT?type=companyNews

33,"   By Joel Schectman | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. authorities will reach a settlement with medical device maker Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc over bribery allegations in the next four weeks, prosecutors said in a court filing Thursday.The new agreement would replace a 2012 settlement with the U.S. Justice Department over allegations that Biomet paid bribes to state-employed healthcare providers in Argentina, Brazil and China in order to win business. Prosecutors said in June that Biomet breached that agreement after the company came forward with new allegations of misconduct in Mexico and Brazil.The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act makes it a crime to bribe overseas officials to gain business. A spokesman for Indiana-based Biomet, which was acquired by Zimmer Holdings last year, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.On Thursday, prosecutors said they would soon reach a new agreement.  ""The parties have made substantial progress in those discussions and expect to resolve this matter within approximately four weeks,"" prosecutors said in the filing in Washington, D.C. federal court.
