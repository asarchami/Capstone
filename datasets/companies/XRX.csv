0,"  Xerox Corp (XRX.N), best known as a maker of printers and copiers, reported weaker-than-expected quarterly revenue as growth in its services business stalled.The services division, which manages businesses ranging from toll systems to healthcare programs, failed to register growth for the first time since 2009, when Xerox entered the business by buying Affiliated Computer Services Inc.The company has been focusing on the business, which brings in 55 percent of its revenue, as cost-conscious companies print less and personal computing moves to tablets and smartphones, putting pressure on its traditional printer and copier business.Revenue from business process outsourcing dropped 3 percent in the fourth quarter because of the loss of a high-margin federal contract to handle student loans last year and weakness in its customer care business, Chief Financial Officer Kathy Mikells said on a conference call.Growth in IT outsourcing slowed as Xerox won fewer deals in the quarter.Services revenue is expected to grow by about 1 percent in the current quarter, driven by BPO as the business signs on more customers and as the company closed its acquisition of Germany-based customer care services provider Invoco Holding GmbH last week, Mikells said. The company's operating margin shrank 1.3 percentage points to 9.3 percent in the fourth quarter as it had to spend more than expected to set up Medicaid management platforms and healthcare exchanges, and the loss of the student loan contract last year.Mikells said Xerox set up Medicaid management portals for New Hampshire and Alaska and healthcare exchanges for Nevada, among others, last year.Revenue from its printing business dropped 6 percent to $2.4 billion in the quarter ended December 31. The services business generated $3.0 billion in revenue. Total revenue dropped 3.4 percent to $5.57 billion.Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox slipped to $310 million, or 25 cents per share, from $334 million, or 26 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, the company earned 29 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 29 cents per share on revenue of $5.64 billion, according to Thomson ReutersI/B/E/S. The company also forecast adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of 23-25 cents per share for the three months to March 31, which was largely in line with analysts' average estimate of 24 cents per share.Xerox shares were down 2 percent at $11.50 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.(Reporting by Sruthi Ramakrishnan in Bangalore,)",2014-01-24,XRX,"Fri Jan 24, 2014 | 12:04pm EST",Xerox revenue misses estimate as services growth stalls,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-xerox-results-idUSBREA0N0SS20140124?type=companyNews

21,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, December 03 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings for Xerox  Corp. (Xerox) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Affiliated Computer Services,  Inc. (ACS), including the long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Fitch's actions affect $9.8 billion of debt,  including Xerox's undrawn $2 billion revolving credit facility (RCF).  KEY RATING DRIVERS Xerox's ratings and Stable Outlook reflect: --Fitch's expectations for improving operating results in Services to offset  revenue declines in Document Technology (DT), primarily black-and-white (B&W)  high-end production printing.  --Substantial recurring revenue from long-term services contracts, rentals and  financing, and supplies (86% of total revenue for the quarter ended Sept. 30,  2014). --Solid liquidity supported by $1 billion of cash at Sept. 30. 2014, an undrawn  $2 billion RCF due 2019, staggered debt maturities and consistent annual free  cash flow (FCF). Fitch believes FCF (post-dividends) will exceed $1.3 billion  annually over the intermediate term. --Fitch expectations for an increasingly diversified revenue mix from faster  growth in the Services segment and with declining exposure to the slower-growing  print industry. Services accounts for 57% of Xerox's total revenue.  --Xerox's conservative financial policies. Fitch believes management remains  committed to an investment-grade rating and has a track record of reducing debt  to offset declining financing assets, resulting in flat core leverage.  Fitch expects Xerox's core leverage, which excludes debt and operating EBITDA  related to financing activities, to remain below 1.5x through the intermediate  term. For the LTM ended Sept. 30, 2014, Fitch estimates core leverage was 1.3x.  For the same time period, core leverage, including off-balance-sheet debt, and  gross leverage was 1.5x and 2.5x, respectively.  Fitch's credit concerns center on: --Fitch expectations for ongoing revenue pressures in DT, which includes  equipment and supplies bundled with Document Outsourcing (DO) contracts. Fitch  forecasts mid-single-digit revenue declines for DT through the  intermediate-term. Revenues fell 5.5% year-over-year in the latest 12 months  (LTM) ending Sept. 30, 2014, due to weakness in B&W. Benefits from restructuring  resulting in higher DT operating margin will partially mitigate revenue  declines. Operating profit margin will exceed 12.5% through the intermediate  term, up from 10.8% in 2013.  --The aggregate $1.1 billion underfunding of worldwide defined benefit (DB)  pension plans as of year-end 2013, down from $1.8 billion in the prior year. The  higher funded status primarily reflects lower benefit obligations due to a 110-  and 20-basis point increase in the U.S. and non-U.S. discount rates,  respectively. Total contributions are expected to be $250 million in 2014 up  from $230 million in 2013.  --Pressured operating margin in the Services business. Fitch expects operating  margin to remain in the mid-9% range through at least 2015 but reach 10% in the  longer term, driven by greater contract bidding discipline. Fitch expects  Xerox's Services segment operating margin to decrease for the fourth consecutive  year in 2014 to just below 9% from 9.8% in 2013.  Cost overruns related to government healthcare contracts and the continued  run-off of certain higher margin business process outsourcing contracts,  consisting of student loan processing and customer care (CC) volume with a  telecom client post- acquisition, drove operating profit margin compression. RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: --Fitch's expectations for Services operating profit margin sustained below 9%;  --Sustained declines in DT more than offsetting growth in Services, resulting in  a material decline in financial performance and credit metrics. Positive rating actions are unlikely in the absence of: --A significant reduction in the funding shortfall for Xerox's worldwide defined  benefit pension plan;  --DT revenues levels which stabilize with expectations for sustained operating  profit margin near current levels;   --Revenue growth and margin expansion in Services that results in expectations  for FCF margin approaching 10%. Xerox's liquidity is solid, supported by $1 billion of cash at Sept. 30, 2014  and an undrawn $2 billion RCF that matures in March 2019. Fitch's expectation  for more than $1.5 billion of annual FCF also supports liquidity.  Total debt with equity credit was $7.8 billion on Sept. 30, 2014, consisting of  approximately $7.5 billion of senior unsecured debt and $349 million of  convertible preferred stock, which Fitch assigns 50% equity credit. As of Sept.  30, 2014, $4.2 billion, or 54%, of total debt, supported Xerox's financing  business based on a debt-to-equity ratio of 7:1 for the financing assets.  Xerox's net financing assets, consisting of receivables and equipment on  operating leases, totaled $4.8 billion compared with $5.2 billion in the prior  year.  Xerox's nearest debt maturities include $1 billion of senior notes due Feb. 15,  2015 and $250 million of senior notes due June 1, 2015.  Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Xerox --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Revolving credit facility (RCF) at 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'BBB'; --Commercial paper at 'F2'. ACS --IDR at 'BBB'; --Senior notes at 'BBB'.

67,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 11 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB-' rating to Xerox  Corporation's (Xerox) $1 billion senior unsecured term loan. Pro forma for the  term loan, Fitch rates $10.4 billion of total debt including the undrawn $2  billion revolving credit facility (RCF). Fitch's ratings on Xerox, including the  Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'BBB-', remain on Rating Watch Negative  pending clarification on the ultimate corporate and capital structure of Xerox  after it separates into two publicly traded companies (the separation). A full  list of current ratings follows at the end of this release. Xerox entered into the term loan, which will be drawn by April 1, 2016, with a  syndicate of banks. The term loan expires on the earlier of 364 days or upon  receipt of financing related to the separation. Xerox will use net proceeds from  the term loan to meet near-term bond maturities and for general corporate  purposes. KEY RATING DRIVERS The proposed separation effectively unwinds the 2010 acquisition of ACS,  separating the business process outsourcing (BPO) businesses associated with the  ACS deal from the legacy Xerox businesses, including the Document Technology  (DT) segment and the Document Outsourcing (DO) portion of the Services segment.  The legacy Xerox business accounts for roughly $11 billion (approximately 60% of  the total) of Xerox's 2015 consolidated revenues, while the BPO businesses  represent the remaining approximately $7 billion (approximately 40% of total).  The ratings reflect Fitch's belief that the separation reduces diversification,  scale and top-line growth prospects even as DT continues to face significant  long-term secular headwinds and BPO is in the midst of a multi-year  restructuring. The ratings also reflect Fitch's belief that alternative  scenarios (including a leveraging recapitalization, business sale, straight  separation of the DT and Services segment, or nothing) would be less  credit-friendly or would intensify event risk, were Xerox not to complete the  separation. Fitch's maintenance of the Negative Watch reflects the current lack of certainty  as to which of the two public companies will constitute the Remainco, as well as  the Remainco's ultimate structure and capitalization. Fitch believes legacy  Xerox is more likely to be Remainco, given legacy Xerox could be capitalized  with the majority of debt, including all financing business related debt, and  modest share of core debt aimed at preserving an investment-grade rating.  Fitch anticipates resolving the Negative Watch upon formalization of Remainco's  ultimate structure and capitalization. Were legacy Xerox to constitute the  Remainco, the Negative Watch could be removed and ratings affirmed at 'BBB-' if  Fitch believes the operating profile will strengthen from investments in DT  markets that yield legitimate prospects for the resumption of top-line growth in  the intermediate term.  Were the BPO businesses to constitute Remainco, Fitch believes the most likely  resolution of the Negative Watch would be a downgrade to non-investment grade.  While the BPO businesses have the operating profile of and could be capitalized  for low investment grade, we do not believe there is meaningful strategic  rationale. Also, given Carl Icahn will receive three board seats in connection  with Xerox's conclusion of its strategic and capital allocation review and that  ACS operated as non-investment grade prior to its acquisition by Xerox, Fitch  does not view an investment-grade capital structure as likely. Xerox announced it will separate into two public companies, driven by the  company's belief that a greater focus on its unique markets and sets of  customers will drive improved operating performance. Xerox did not disclose  costs associated with the separation but Fitch believes these will be limited to  unwinding currently shared general corporate, given the lack of market-facing,  technology and revenue synergies that exist between legacy Xerox and BPO. The  separation is subject to customary regulatory review and approvals and Xerox  expects to complete the separation by the end of 2016.  In connection with the plan to separate, Xerox also reached an agreement with  its largest shareholder, Carl Icahn, that will provide him with three seats on  the Board of Directors of the BPO company. Fitch notes the agreement does not  provide for any change to Xerox's current shareholder return policies prior to  separation.  Finally, Xerox announced a plan that will reduce annual costs by $2.4 billion on  a run-rate basis by the end of 2018. For the DT segment, restructuring is  essential to maintain operating income margins in the 12% to 14% range within  the context of secular revenue declines. For Services, cost reductions should  drive contract renewals and underpin the segment's efforts to achieve and  maintain industry-average operating income margin of more than 9%. Fitch expects near-term operating results will remain challenged by significant  currency headwinds and secular revenue declines in DT (mid-single digits) that  have been exacerbated by lower demand in developing markets, consistent with the  company's just announced full-year 2015 results. DO continues to grow in  constant currency driven by increased outsourcing trends and the BPO businesses  are poised to resume flat-to-normalized low single-digit constant currency  growth following multiple years of contract portfolio refinement. Fitch anticipates operating income margins will be flat-to-slightly higher,  driven by productivity and improving performance in Services, which is  structurally higher following the exit of unprofitable healthcare system builds.  Xerox expects $1 billion to $1.2 billion of pre-dividend free cash flow (FCF) in  2016 and to use roughly half for shareholder returns, including $300 million of  dividends. The remainder will be used for acquisitions and managing core  leverage.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Xerox include: --Low-single-digit negative revenue growth in constant currency, driven by  low-single-digit growth in DO, flat-to-slightly up growth in BPO and mid-single  digit negative growth in DT. --Flat-to slightly up operating income margin, driven by restructuring and BPO's  exit of healthcare system builds. --Use of 50% of pre-dividend FCF for shareholder returns, including more than  $300 million of dividends and the remaining for share repurchases. --Modest acquisition activity with other cash used for some core debt reduction  aimed at maintaining core leverage within 1.5x. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch believes negative rating actions could occur if the company provides  further clarity on the ultimate capitalization and financial policies for  Remainco that are not meaningfully more conservative than they are now, given  the company's reduced diversification, scale and top-line growth prospects. Fitch believes Xerox providing further clarity on the ultimate capitalization  and financial policies for Remainco that are meaningfully more conservative than  currently could result in affirmation of Remainco at 'BBB-'. LIQUIDITY Pro forma for net proceeds from the $1 billion term loan, Fitch believes Xerox's  liquidity was solid at Dec. 31, 2015 and consists of: --$2.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents; and --An undrawn $2 billion RCF expiring March 2019. Fitch's expectation for $1 billion of annual FCF also supports liquidity. Pro forma for the $1 billion term loan, total debt, including 50% equity credit  applied to the $349 million of convertible preferred stock, was $8.5 billion as  of Dec. 31, 2015. Nearly half of total debt, or $3.9 billion, supported Xerox's  financing business based on a debt-to-equity ratio of 7:1 for the financing  assets. Xerox's net financing assets, consisting of receivables and equipment on  operating leases, totaled $4.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2015, compared with $4.8  billion exiting the prior year. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch rates the $1 billion senior unsecured 364-day term loan 'BBB-'. Fitch currently rates Xerox: --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'BBB-'; --Short-term IDR 'F3'; --Revolving credit facility 'BBB-'; --Senior unsecured debt 'BBB-'; --Commercial paper 'F3'. The ratings are on Rating Watch Negative.

Cravath ranked second, having advised on $927 billion of announced deals.Barshay, who joined Cravath in 1991 after graduating from Columbia Law School, had been a major contributor to that law firm's success. Last year alone, he worked on transactions with a total value of more than $250 billion.His work in the last 12 months has included advising 3G Capital and H.J. Heinz on their $60 billion merger with Kraft, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA on its $107 billion acquisition of SABMiller Plc, and Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc on its pending $13.6 billion sale to Marriott International Inc. Barshay has also served as an adviser to many companies defending themselves against activist investors, including Avon Products Inc on its settlement agreement with Barington Capital, Qualcomm Inc against JANA Partners, and Xerox Corp against Carl Icahn.It was at Xerox in the last few months that Barshay got to work more closely with some of Paul Weiss's senior partners. He was advising Xerox, while Paul Weiss's Brad Karp and Robert Schumer were advising its board. This laid the ground for Barshay's move.""Paul Weiss's wide range of highest quality practices and extraordinary lawyers will be invaluable in serving the needs of our clients,"" Barshay said in a statement on Sunday. Paul Weiss's recent deals include advising Time Warner Cable Inc on its pending approximately $79 billion proposed merger with Charter Communications Inc, Exor SpA  on its $7 billion acquisition of PartnerRe Ltd, and Apollo Global Management on its $6.9 billion acquisition of ADT Corp. Paul Weiss is also known for its top corporate litigation and regulatory practices.Cravath is among the law firms that reward their partners based on seniority, rather than business generated, in a compensation system known in the legal industry as ""lockstep,"" designed to avoid disputes over who brought in which client. Barshay declined to comment on his compensation. Karp, who serves as Paul Weiss's chairman, also declined to comment on Barshay's compensation, but noted that his firm applied a modified lockstep structure that offers some flexibility in rewarding outstanding performers in any particular year.While Cravath refrains from advising activist investors, Paul Weiss has occasionally represented some hedge funds on activism matters in the past. However, Paul Weiss recently decided to no longer represent investors on activist campaigns, according to people familiar with the firm who asked not to be identified discussing internal strategy.For Barshay, this meant that there was no perceived conflict with his practice, a big part of which includes defending companies against activist investors.(Corrects misspelling of Cravath in second paragraph)",2016-04-04,XRX,"Mon Apr 4, 2016 | 9:48am EDT",Law firm Paul Weiss hires Cravath M&A rainmaker Barshay,http://www.reuters.com//article/paulweiss-moves-barshay-idUSL2N1770CM?type=companyNews

99,"   By Aishwarya Venugopal  Printer and copier maker Xerox Corp reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit as restructuring efforts ahead of its planned split into two companies helped cut costs. The company, which is splitting to separate its printer business from its business process outsourcing unit, said it slashed about 1,300 jobs globally in the second quarter.Xerox's total costs declined 6 percent to $4.24 billion. This included restructuring and related charges of $71 million, less than the $100 million the company had estimated in April.Shares of Xerox, which said it was on track to meet its annualized cost savings target of about $700 million for 2016, rose nearly 4 percent in early trading on Friday.Xerox said it expected one-time pretax separation costs of $175 million-$200 million, lower than the $200 million-$250 million it had estimated earlier. The company had about 131,800 employees as of June-end, down about 11,800 from the end of December.

107,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 11 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings expects to resolve the Watch Negative  and affirm Xerox Corporation's (Xerox) ratings, including the Long- and  Short-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDR), at 'BBB-/F3' upon its separation of  Conduent Incorporated (Conduent). Fitch expects the Rating Outlook will be  Negative.  Fitch's expected affirmation follows an Amendment to  Conduent's Registration  Statement on Form 10, which discloses Conduent's anticipated capital structure,  liquidity and cash transfer to Xerox upon separation. Conduent will transfer  approximately $2 billion to Xerox prior to separation, which we expect Xerox  will use for near-term debt reduction, resulting in core leverage (which  excludes profitability and debt associated with the equipment financing  business) below 1x.  Xerox will separate Conduent, which will be comprised of the Business Process  Outsourcing (BPO) businesses within Xerox's Services segment (excluding the  Document Outsourcing business, which will remain at Xerox) through a spin-off  transaction intended to be tax-free for Xerox shareholders for federal income  tax purposes. The separation unwinds legacy Xerox's 2010 acquisition of  Affiliated Computer Services Inc. (ACS) for $6 billion and is expected to be  completed at the end of calendar 2016. The expected affirmation and Negative Outlook reflect Fitch's expectations for: Secular Top-Line Headwinds: Fitch expects continued headwinds through the  intermediate term with pockets of growth in core markets insufficient to offset  the anticipation of mid- and low-teens rates of decline in core mid-range A3 and  MFP and high-end mono printers, respectively. Longer term, packaging, workflow  automation, printed electronics and 3D printing opportunities could be  significant but should require meaningful investments, including acquisitions. Solid Free Cash Flow: Fitch expects annual pre-dividend FCF (excluding changes  in financing assets) will remain solid from 75% annuity-based revenue, despite  top-line pressures. Pre-dividend FCF should range from $500 million to $1  billion beyond the near term, and will include separation-related charges and  cash restructuring. Fitch expects pension contributions and cash restructuring  could be $500 million over the next two years. Xerox continues generating the  majority of its revenue in the U.S., so Fitch expects longer-term domestic FCF  will be more than sufficient to support modest tuck-in acquisitions and debt  reduction or shareholder returns. Conservative Financial Policies: Fitch expects Xerox's financial policies will  remain conservative over the longer term, driven by the company's strategic  focus on maintaining an investment-grade rating to support the financing  business. In conjunction with the spin-off, Xerox plans to use the $2 billion  cash transfer from Conduent to repay near-term debt maturities, which Fitch  estimates would result in $4.5 billion to $5 billion of nominal debt, or $900  million to $1 billion of core debt. As a result, Fitch expects core leverage,  which excludes debt and profitability associated with the financing business,  will be 0.5x-1x post-separation.  Reduced Scale and Diversification: The separation reduces Xerox's scale, revenue  diversification and organic growth prospects. The BPO business represented  approximately 40% of 2015 revenue with minimal customer overlap and we believe  it is poised for low-single-digit positive organic revenue growth over the  longer term with profit margin expansion from restructuring. Pro forma for the  separation, Xerox will consist of Document Technologies (DT; two-thirds of  revenue), declining by mid-single digits with low double-digit profit margins,  and Document Outsourcing (DO; one-third), which is growing in the low- to  mid-single digits with profit margins in-line with DT. Cost Reduction Roadmap: Fitch expects Xerox's cost reduction roadmap will be  significant and ongoing in light of expectations for continued top-line  pressures. Still, the company will restructure aggressively and, as a  consequence, should maintain profit margin through the intermediate term and  position Xerox for profit margin expansion upon improved revenue performance.  Fitch estimates Xerox could take out more than $250 million of costs annually  through the intermediate term, largely through headcount reductions and  footprint optimization. A3 and DO Market Leadership: Fitch expects Xerox will continue to benefit from  market leadership in core markets, including A3 Mid-Range, High-End Color, and  Mono and Document Outsourcing.
