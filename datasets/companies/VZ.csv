7,"   By Natalie Harrison, Danielle Robinson and Michelle Sierra  NEW YORK, Jan 17 (IFR/RLPC) - Charter Communications  will test the capacity of the high-yield bond and leveraged loan market the way Verizon did in investment-grade if it is successful in its attempted takeover of Time Warner Cable (TWC).Its USD37.3bn hostile bid, based on an offer of USD132.50 a share, would require as much as USD24bn in debt financing.Although the details of the package still need to be ironed out, and could change if Charter increases its rejected offer or joins up with a rival such as Comcast, it will probably be structured as a Double B type credit with about six times leverage, bankers said.Regardless of the fine-tuning, the bonds and loans each have the potential to be record-breakers in terms of size. The bond component will probably overtake Sprint's USD6.5bn deal that was priced last year as the largest ever junk bond, while the loan piece could surpass HJ Heinz's USD9.5bn loan from last year - and even Clear Channel's USD10.7bn deal from 2008.With about USD60bn in debt, the combined company would also become the biggest high-yield issuer in the market - larger even than Telecom Italia - raising some questions as to how much investors will be able to own in the name.Despite this, bankers are confident the deal can be done - likening it to the USD28bn buyout of Heinz last year by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, which needed about USD14bn of new debt.Even another big potential deal in the market requiring jumbo financing shouldn't matter, something bankers have to consider given speculation that Sprint  - 80% owned by SoftBank Corp - may bid for T-Mobile.""This isn't going to be a seven times leveraged deal with no equity. It will have a Double B type capital structure, and investors say they need deals like this in size,"" said one debt capital markets banker. As one investor put it: ""The market is wide open.""PLAYING AROUND Charter, rated Ba3/BB- by Moody's and S&P, described the financing package as ""prudent, with a longer tenor than Charter today and low cost"".It has fully negotiated USD20.5bn in new debt and a USD3.5bn bridge loan with its four banks - Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs - and would also need to refinance existing debt of both companies if the deal goes through. ""There's bound to be a lot of playing around to see where the company can get the most benefit and the cheapest cost of capital,"" said one analyst.That almost certainly means that TWC's existing USD25bn bonds will stay in place. Currently rated Baa2/BBB/BBB, those bonds will be the cheapest debt Charter will have at its disposal, though they will almost certainly fall to junk status.Moody's is so far the only agency to place the ratings of the companies on review for downgrade.""I can't see any reason why those bonds will not be left in the capital structure. Just as in the Heinz buyout, they will be subordinated, and the new bonds will come in above them,"" said another leveraged finance banker. ""It makes no sense to take them out. They not only provide cheap debt, but they limit the amount of new debt that has to be raised.""With no change of control language in those bonds, their prices in secondary trading have sunk. In fact, they have been trading more like a Ba1 entity since talk of a bid first emerged last summer.There is some protection for bondholders that will affect the structure of the bond financing, but it's pretty negligible. Moody's reckons that only USD4bn-USD5bn of new secured debt can be added to the new capital structure due to indentures on the TWC bonds that cap the amount of additional liens of secured debt.The bottom line, though, is that this is just the first round of what is inevitably going to be a long process.Major TWC shareholders have said they would be receptive to a higher offer, but there's also a chance that other cable players such as Cox could surface with rival bids.Then there's Liberty Media. Analysts at CreditSights say Liberty could inject USD4bn to USD5bn of cash into Charter in order to maintain a 27% stake in the combined Charter/TWC entity - a move that would limit the amount of debt Charter would have to raise.Liberty has several pockets of liquidity it could tap, they say, including margin loans and the ability to raise incremental funds at SIRI. A cash injection of that magnitude could keep the Charter leverage only modestly above five times, with a quick roadmap back below that level through growth and synergies, CreditSights said.As the first analyst said: ""Whatever happens, TWC is now fully in play.""",2014-01-17,VZ,"Fri Jan 17, 2014 | 9:47am EST",Debt markets braced for Charter test,http://www.reuters.com//article/charter-timewarnercable-debt-idUSL5N0KR28F20140117?type=companyNews
8,"   By Liana B. Baker and Ronald Grover  Verizon Communications Inc's acquisition of Intel Corp's venture to create a web-based TV service may be the catalyst that pushes U.S. cable players to start similar products to fend off fast-growing video rivals such as Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc.The deal, announced on Tuesday, came two weeks after Sony Corp revealed it was working on its own cable-like video service and makes it likely that Internet-delivered TV services may be getting closer after attempts from Apple Inc and other technology companies.Amazon has also considering an online TV service, and has been talking with content owners about licensing TV networks, according to the Wall Street Journal.Verizon said it acquired Intel Corp's OnCue service for an undisclosed sum to accelerate its push into next-generation video services, including integrating it with its FiOS product, the fiber-based Internet and TV offering that has 5.3 million video subscribers, about 5 percent of pay TV households.In a more ambitious move, Verizon also says it intends to deliver ""over the top to any device,"" which almost certainly would kick off a race to capture eyeballs that will force cable operators to offer standalone services outside their service territories.""For Verizon this could be an opportunity for them to offer a triple play to subscribers in the rest of the country,"" said Blair Westlake, who until recently headed Microsoft Corp's media and entertainment group. ""If you're a Comcast that may get you thinking that it's time to start offering video in other markets as well.""Verizon has the brand, marketing dollars and customer relationships to make it a viable threat to cable operators, said UBS analyst John Hodulik.There is a likely market waiting for it as well. North American consumers will spend $6 billion in 2014 on entertainment from over-the-top services such as Netflix, more than twice what they spent in 2010, according to PwC's annual entertainment and media forecast. Cable TV operators, meanwhile, are losing video subscribers to satellite and telecom operators, according to SNL Kagan, putting pressure on their operating margins due to rising programming costs.CABLE WARS If Verizon's move prompts a similar bid from cable companies, it would upset a decades-long balance in the cable TV industry, which operates in near monopoly status with markets carefully carved up by local governments. Customers could choose between Comcast and Time Warner Cable for their video service, or Verizon for that matter.Comcast may be furthest along with a potential over-the-top service with its Xfinity X1 platform, which allows a subscriber to its traditional video service to toggle between live and on-demand programming with a slick interface. A Comcast spokeswoman said the company is focused on getting that product released across its markets and not on an ""over-the-top"" service.""If Comcast really launches one, it starts a war between all the different cable companies that are already incumbents,"" said BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield. ""That probably means they fight over price, service and features that are great for the consumer.""It won't be easy for a new entrant to get started, however. Content owners so far have not granted cable operators the digital rights to sell their shows outside their markets.That has not stopped both cable and satellite companies from eyeing the opportunity. Both Time Warner Cable Inc and satellite operator DirecTV bid on Hulu - the video streaming site owned by Walt Disney Co's ABC network, Comcast's NBCUniversal and Fox parent Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. Hulu's owners, the major content companies, decided instead to invest in it rather than sell it. Charter, which has made a bid to buy No. 2 cable provider Time Warner Cable, has openly floated the idea. ""We may sell subscriptions everywhere,"" Charter Chief Executive Officer Tom Rutledge said in an November conference call, responding to a question about Charter's streaming TV application.Cable's competitors aren't sitting idle. DirecTV CEO Mike White has said the No. 1 satellite operator is working on an ""over-the-top"" video package to suit niche audiences, such as Hispanic or kids programming. DirecTV's rival Dish Network Corp is also eyeing the online opportunity.""We're thinking of over the top too,"" Dish CEO Joe Clayton said on the sidelines of the Consumer Electronics Show in early January.Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson research, is skeptical that online video newcomers such as Sony can be profitable enough to take on the incumbents. When folks start using huge amounts of bandwidth for TV viewing, he predicts Internet bills will jump as providers start charging by usage.""A virtual provider like Sony could be left with a me-too service,"" Moffett says, ""and an even higher total cost to the end user than the Pay TV subscription they would be hoping to replace.""For some cable operators, this could mean opportunity emerging from the chaos. Cablevision Systems Corp CEO James Dolan, for one, has said he sees a future in which cable operators no longer use their wires to offer video service and instead just offer broadband Internet, which makes more money.(Reporting by Liana B.

24,"  WASHINGTON Jan 30 U.S. wireless providers like AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc on Thursday received a nod from regulators to test a transition of the telephone industry away from traditional analog networks to digital ones.The Federal Communications Commission unanimously voted in favor of trials, in which telecommunications companies would test switching telephone services from existing circuit-switch technology to an alternative Internet protocol-based one to see how the change may affect consumers.The experiments approved by the FCC would not test the new technology - it is already being used - and would not determine law and policy regulating it, FCC staff said. The trials would seek to establish, among other things, how consumers welcome the change and how new technology performs in emergency situations, including in remote locations.""What we're doing here is a big deal. This is an important moment,"" FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said. ""We today invite service providers to propose voluntary experiments for all-IP networks."" The move in part grants the application by AT&T to conduct IP transition tests as companies that offer landline phone services seek to ultimately replace their old copper wires with newer technology like fiber or wireless. ""We cannot continue requiring service providers to invest in both old networks and new networks forever,"" Commissioner Ajit Pai, a Republican, said.Some consumers, particularly in rural or hard-to-reach areas, have complained about poor connectivity of their IP-based services. Advocates have also expressed concerns about the impact of the transition on consumers with disabilities. ""I think we must be mindful of the impact this transition has on consumers -- their needs, their expectations and their willingness to embrace network change,"" said Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat.The trials will be voluntary, and regulators require that the experiments ""cover areas with different population densities and demographics, different topologies, and/or different seasonal and meteorological conditions.""

25,"  WASHINGTON Feb 3 The Federal Communications Commission, doubling its investment in high-speed Internet at schools, on Monday pledged an additional $2 billion over two years for improving broadband networks in schools and libraries.The investment comes through E-Rate, a subsidy program funded by fees Americans pay on their monthly phone bills that helps schools and libraries get discounts on Internet services and digital devices.Created in 1996, E-Rate has been giving schools around $2.4 billion a year. But demand has far exceeded that amount, FCC officials have said, and of all E-Rate funding, only about half has gone toward equipping schools and libraries with true high-speed Internet access, the agency said.In what FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler called a ""business-like approach,"" the agency would reshuffle how it spends the current E-Rate funds to prioritize high-capacity Internet connections over other purposes and to improve the program's efficiency and management. While most experts agree on the benefits and the need to modernize E-Rate, opinions have differed on how to fund the changes.At first the additional funds will come from unused money from previous years, the FCC said in detailing its plans to boost spending on high-speed Internet. Later, funds would come from reforms the FCC is considering for the E-Rate program, such as no longer paying for outdated technologies, including paging or dial-up Internet. The effort is part of President Barack Obama's push to connect 99 percent of U.S. schools to high-speed broadband and wireless Internet within five years to spur use of digital technology in the classrooms.Nearly all U.S. schools have access to basic Internet, the FCC said, but the speed and quality at many is far from ideal. The new funds would be targeted toward ""the most urgent Internet upgrade needs,"" the agency said. The FCC said its increased investment in high-speed Internet will connect 20 million students at 15,000 schools. Wheeler is expected to address the changes further in a speech later this week.The White House is working with companies such as tech giants Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp, and wireless providers Sprint Corp and Verizon Communications Inc on other ways to improve digital experiences in American schools.Schools and libraries are clamoring for faster Internet speeds to promote digital learning, which has been shown to improve test scores and graduation rates.",2014-02-03,VZ,"Mon Feb 3, 2014 | 5:32pm EST",U.S. boosting investment in high-speed Internet in schools by $2 bln,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-fcc-erate-idUSL2N0L81LD20140203?type=companyNews
26,"  WASHINGTON Feb 3 Sprint Corp Chairman Masayoshi Son is slated to meet with Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler on Monday, an FCC official said, as the No. 3 U.S. wireless provider mulls a potential bid for smaller rival T-Mobile US Inc.Son's Tokyo-based SoftBank Corp acquired Sprint last year and has recently been in talks to acquire T-Mobile US, sources have told Reuters.FCC chiefs routinely meet with industry executives in sessions that often cover a wide range of topics. Sprint Chief Executive Dan Hesse was also scheduled to attend Monday's meeting, the FCC official said, speaking anonymously because the FCC chairman's schedule is not public.Son in recent weeks has been pushing for more consolidation in a U.S. wireless market dominated by four major providers: Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T Inc, Sprint and T-Mobile. Sprint has been interested in combining with T-Mobile for years and top executives from both companies have argued that consolidation was necessary in the U.S. wireless market, as cooperation in infrastructure and equipment orders would create a stronger rival against the biggest players, Verizon and AT&T. However, the deal would face strong headwinds in getting regulators' approval at the Justice Department and the FCC.U.S. antitrust chief, William Baer, last week reiterated his skepticism toward any mergers between any of the two top four wireless phone companies. Baer and Wheeler have both hailed the 2011 rejection of a merger between AT&T and T-Mobile as yielding a more competitive market that is better for consumers.AT&T over the weekend announced a plan to cut prices on its large shared data plans in the latest sign that the rivalry between the top U.S. cellular players may be triggering increased discounting.",2014-02-03,VZ,"Mon Feb 3, 2014 | 10:30am EST",Sprint chairman to meet with top U.S. telecom regulator Monday,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-sprint-fcc-idUSL2N0L80LP20140203?type=companyNews
27,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating to  Verizon Communications Inc.'s (NYSE: VZ) proposed notes, consisting of euro or  sterling notes, or a combination thereof. VZ's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is  'A-' and the Rating Outlook is Stable. The primary use of proceeds from the offering will be to finance, in part, the  company's acquisition of Vodafone Group, PLC's (Vodafone) 45% interest in Cellco  Partnership (which does business as Verizon Wireless). Net proceeds so used will  reduce anticipated borrowings under the company's term loan, which provides for  up to $12 billion in borrowings to finance the acquisition. To the extent  offering proceeds are not used to finance the acquisition, they will be used for  general corporate purposes.  KEY RATING DRIVERS --In February 2014, VZ's proposed $130 billion acquisition of Vodafone's 45%  interest in Cellco Partnership (which does business as Verizon Wireless) is  expected to close. Shareholders of both companies have approved the transaction.  The transaction remains subject to the approval of the High Court of Justice of  England and Wales, and other closing conditions. --The acquisition pressures VZ's near-term credit metrics, pushing pro forma  leverage at closing to approximately 2.7x. Subsequent to the close of the  acquisition, Fitch expects VZ to materially reduce debt over the next few years.  EBITDA growth, combined with debt reductions is expected to reduce leverage to  approximately 2x by the end of 2016, which Fitch believes is appropriate for an  'A-' rating. --Fitch is cognizant that leverage will be outside an appropriate range for an  'A-' rating for several years. However, Fitch has a high level of confidence  metrics will return to a level appropriate for the rating due to the company's  strong position in the wireless industry and the significant cash flows  generated by the wireless business, in combination with management's commitment  to delever. Management's commitment to delevering has been shown in the past by  the aggressive delevering following the acquisition of Alltel Corporation in  early 2009. Other supporting factors include the absence of operations-related  execution risk. --A key to debt reduction over the next several years will be the continued  generation of strong free cash flow (FCF) at Verizon Wireless (VZW). VZW's  simple FCF (EBITDA less capital spending) in 2013 was approximately $24.8  billion. VZ's consolidated FCF (after dividends and capital spending but before  distributions to Vodafone) was $16.3 billion in 2013. Fitch estimates FCF will  be at least 50% lower in 2014 as a result of transaction-related interest costs,  higher dividend requirements due to the shares issued to Vodafone equity holders  and higher cash taxes.  --The strong competitive position of VZW as evidenced by industry-low churn  rates, high margins and the most developed LTE network in the U.S. support  expectations for VZ's cash flow stability and the longer rating horizon embodied  in the rating.  VZ's gross leverage at year-end 2013 was 2.2x, with total debt at $93.6 billion.  Consolidated cash balances of $53.5 billion on Dec. 31, 2013 include proceeds  from the $49 billion of debt issued in September 2013 to finance the  transaction, and as a result net leverage was only 1.0x.  To finance the remainder of the transaction, VZ will draw on a $12 billion term  loan, with anticipated borrowings on the loan reduced by any proceeds from the  current offering. The term loan's principal financial covenant requires leverage  to be 3.5x or less but falls away upon achieving 'A-' ratings, as defined in the  agreement. VZ's liquidity is supported by a $6.2 billion credit facility, and Fitch expects  the company to maintain aggregate CP balances within a level fully backed by the  facility. The credit facility has no ratings triggers or other restrictive  covenants, such as leverage or interest coverage tests. In August 2013, the  facility was extended for a year and now matures in August 2017. After the  effect of letters of credit (LOCs), approximately $6.1 billion is available on  the facility. In October 2013, VZ entered into a $2 billion 364-day revolving  credit facility, which may be drawn upon after the wireless transaction closes.  The 364-day facility has a 3.5x leverage covenant. On a consolidated basis, VZ  and its subsidiaries have scheduled debt maturities of approximately $3.2  billion and $2.6 billion in 2014 and 2015, respectively. In 2014, Fitch expects consolidated capital spending to range from $16.5 billion  to $17 billion, comparable to or slightly higher than the $16.6 billion spent in  2013. Investment in the wireless network continues to be an area of emphasis due  to the strong demand for 4G LTE capacity for rapidly growing data services.  RATING SENSITIVITIES A positive rating action could occur if: --Fitch believes a positive rating action is unlikely in the foreseeable future,  given the leverage incurred in the Vodafone transaction. A negative rating action could occur if: --Operating performance causes delevering to take place at a materially slower  than anticipated pace. --A weakening of VZW's competitive position that would jeopardize the stability  of cash flows.

""They are about to shrink their share count by a significant amount,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter told Reuters.The buyback is likely to reduce the number of shares by 4.5 million, Pachter said.The company had 27.6 million shares outstanding as of Dec. 31.Outerwall, looking to cut costs, said in December that it would reduce its workforce by 8.5 percent and discontinue three new ventures - Rubi coffee kiosks, Crisp Market food kiosks and Star Studio photo booths. ""We do expect to generate $22 million of annualized savings beginning this quarter from the restructuring actions we announced in December,"" Chief Financial Officer Galen Smith  told analysts on a conference call.The company on Thursday named Mark Horak as president of its Redbox division, replacing Anne Saunders. Horak comes from Warner Bros Home Entertainment Inc, an unit of Time Warner Inc .Warner Bros Home Entertainment provides services such as video-on-demand and subscriptions for its videos via cable, satellite, online and mobile channels.Outerwall also owns and operates about 20,300 coin-counting kiosks, where consumers feed loose change into the kiosks, which count the change and then dispense vouchers. The company's net income marginally fell to $22.7 million, or 82 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, from $22.9 million, or 75 cents per share, a year earlier.Adjusted core diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.68 per share.Analysts had expected adjusted earnings of $1.22 per share on revenue of $596.1 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose 5.4 percent to $593.7 million but missed the average analyst estimate of $596.1 million.Redbox revenue rose marginally to $496.4 million, and Coinstar unit revenue rose 8.4 percent to $80.7 million.Outerwall forecast first-quarter core diluted share from continuing operations of 77 cents to 97 cents per share on consolidated revenue of $570 million to $600 million.Analysts on average were expecting adjusted earnings of $1.29 per share on revenue of $607.1 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Shares of the company closed at $63.64 on the Nasdaq on Thursday.

29,"  * U.S. joint venture exit to return billions to UK market* Citi estimates minimum $8 bln to return to UK by end-Feb* FTSE 100 could get a 2-3 pct boost, buck 2014 lag* Vodafone may fall if funds hold too much vs index weightBy Simon Jessop and Sudip Kar-GuptaLONDON, Feb 11 Britain's sluggish stock market could get a boost as Vodafone investors sell the Verizon  shares they acquired through a $130 billion buyout of the telecom's U.S. joint venture.Verizon's takeover of Verizon Wireless, the third-biggest deal in corporate history, tees up an $84 billion payout in cash and shares at the end of February, which many may look to reinvest in UK stocks.The market impact will ripple through currencies, funding markets, cash markets and derivatives, and could boost prices for stocks ranging from Vodafone's sector peer BT to the smallest stocks in the FTSE All-Share index. The UK funds which hold many Vodafone shares often have a remit to invest in UK companies, either actively or by passively tracking indices such as the FTSE 100 or the FTSE All-Share.""For some of these funds, it could be 2-3 percent of their fund's AuM (assets under management) returned to them in cash. Their mandates might dictate that this is too much for them not to reinvest it straight away,"" said Ben Lynch, Citi's Global Head of Centralised Risk Trading.While the impact is hard to gauge, some estimate the FTSE 100 could gain as much as 3 percent from the flow and move back into profit for the year from its current 1.5 percent loss.On Feb. 19, the cash/stock ratio for the deal is announced and on Feb. 21, Vodafone shareholders will get a cash tranche amounting to 30 percent of the deal total in dollars, which UK holders may need to convert to pounds and reinvest. While active managers can begin positioning straight away, FTSE trackers will have to wait until Feb. 25 before reinvesting the proceeds of the share portion of the deal.Given that, and the fact the cash portion does not clear until early March, some may choose to buy FTSE futures before exchanging into a cash position later, Lynch said.How much of that money comes back to the UK market is not absolute, but Lynch said ""at a minimum that's about $8 billion"" from European passive investors ""but it could quickly get up to $35 billion over those two tranches"", dependent on what active funds choose to do. Which companies get a slice of the pie and how that affects their share price will depend on who is spending and when.Income funds, for example, may look to replicate the bumper dividend yield offered by Vodafone by investing in large blue-chips such as BP, Royal Dutch Shell and GlaxoSmithKline.Peter Botham, chief investment officer at Brown Shipley, which manages around 3.5 billion pounds, said ""the vast majority of private clients"" would likely make such a play.As well as influencing the dollar-pound exchange rate, options pricing in currencies, stocks and indexes, it could also result in Vodafone being sold off if some funds end up owning too much of the stock relative to its index weight.Hobart Capital director Justin Haque recommended buying the FTSE 100 while selling dollars and Vodafone and Verizon shares, adding in a note to clients that ""the money shift will be eye-watering"".Those who track or benchmark themselves against the FTSE All-Share index, meanwhile, may look to bump up their holdings in smaller companies, many of which have relatively low traded volumes and could therefore get a proportionately bigger boost.Others, particularly active fund managers, may choose to park the funds in cash and wait for better opportunities, such as a potential Lloyds Banking Group share sale in March or April, said Lynch.",2014-02-11,VZ,"Tue Feb 11, 2014 | 10:11am EST",Vodafone windfall to give FTSE a February fillip,http://www.reuters.com//article/ftse-vodafone-idUSL5N0LG17H20140211?type=companyNews

An S&P 500 retail index .SPXRT gained more than 1 percent for a second day.After the bell, shares of J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N) climbed 12.8 percent to $6.72 as the U.S. department store chain forecast more improvement in its comparable sales and gross profit margin this fiscal year.The S&P 500 once again briefly broke above its 2013 year-end closing level of 1,848.36, which has served as resistance, but failed to hold above it, analysts said. The index remained down 0.2 percent for the year.""From a technical perspective, we're battling with the year-to-date break-even mark on the S&P,"" said Todd Salamone, vice president of research at Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati, Ohio. ""It just seems ... there's no firm commitment to drive the S&P back above this particular level.""But he said the market also seems to be biding time until Thursday, when Yellen addresses the Senate Banking Committee in semiannual testimony about monetary policy. This appearance, originally set for February 13, had to be postponed when Washington was walloped with the heaviest snowfall of the season.Her comments will be scrutinized for insight into how much an unexpectedly cold winter has affected economic activity, and for confirmation that the Fed will maintain its stimulus-trimming schedule.

Wednesday's strong retail performance came a day after upbeat results from Macy's (M.N) and Home Depot (HD.N). Home Depot shares on Wednesday closed up 0.9 percent at $81.71 after rising to $82.71, a lifetime high. Macy's stock jumped 3 percent to close at $57.96, off a 52-week high at $58.65. On the economic front, new home sales surged to a 5-1/2-year high in January, far exceeding expectations. While much recent data has been below forecasts, analysts have attributed that to bad weather rather than worsening fundamentals. The housing data could support that interpretation.The day's decliners included First Solar Inc (FSLR.O), whose shares fell a day after the U.S. solar panel maker reported that its fourth-quarter net income fell 58 percent. First Solar's stock slid 9.1 percent to end Wednesday's session at $52.74.Among other after-the-bell movers, shares of Autodesk (ADSK.O) rose 3.7 percent to $56.76 following the release of the computer-aided design (CAD) software maker's results.About 6.9 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 7 billion average so far this month, according to data from BATS Global Markets.Advancers beat decliners by a ratio of slightly more than 3 to 2 on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq.(Editing by Bernadette Baum, Nick Zieminski and Jan Paschal)",2014-02-26,VZ,"Wed Feb 26, 2014 | 6:15pm EST",S&P 500 ends near flat; retailers fly for a second day,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-markets-stocks-idUSBREA080LL20140226?type=companyNews
45,"   By Caroline Valetkevitch | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The S&P 500 closed at a record on Thursday and ended in positive territory for the year after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said harsh weather seems to be to behind recent U.S. economic softness.That gave some relief to investors who supported the view that heavy snowstorms and unusually cold weather - and not worsening fundamentals - were to blame for weak U.S. employment, retail sales and other data.The advance lifted the S&P 500 above its 2013 year-end closing level of 1,848.36, which has served as resistance in recent sessions.""The market was worried. She could have excluded weather and perhaps talked more about the soft patch,"" said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial, which is based in Newark, New Jersey.""I think she gave the market some comfort that she thought it was probably mostly due to weather-related issues.""Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, Yellen also said the Fed would watch carefully to make sure weather was indeed behind the recent weakness. But she said it would take a ""significant change"" to the economy's prospects for the central bank to put plans to reduce its bond-buying program on hold.Some retailers scored sharp gains for a third session, with the shares of J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N) and others jumping after the companies posted strong results. Mylan Inc (MYL.O) gave one of the biggest boosts to both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Mylan's shares shot up 9.4 percent to end at $56.27 after the U.S. generic drugmaker gave a 2014 forecast above Wall Street's estimates.

47,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 28 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating to the  following debt issues for Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ): --$3.3 billion term loan due 2017; --$3.3 billion term loan due 2019; --$2 billion 364-day revolving credit facility due February 2015. Fitch currently rates VZ's IDR 'A-' with a Stable Rating Outlook. Proceeds from the term loans formed part of the $130 billion in consideration  used to acquire Vodafone Group, PLC's (Vodafone) 45% interest in Cellco  Partnership (which does business as Verizon Wireless) on Feb. 21, 2014.  KEY RATING DRIVERS --The acquisition of the remaining Verizon Wireless (VZW) stake pressures VZ's  near-term credit metrics, pushing pro forma leverage at closing to approximately  2.7x. Subsequent to the close of the acquisition, Fitch expects VZ to materially  reduce debt over the next few years. EBITDA growth, combined with debt  reductions is expected to reduce leverage to approximately 2x by the end of  2016. Fitch believes this level is appropriate for an 'A-' rating. --Fitch is cognizant that leverage will be outside an appropriate range for an  'A-' rating for several years. That said, Fitch has a high level of confidence  metrics will return to a level appropriate for the rating due to VZ's strong  position in the wireless industry and the significant cash flows generated by  the wireless business. This is in combination with Verizon management's  commitment to delever, evident by the aggressive delevering following the  acquisition of Alltel Corporation in early 2009. Other supporting factors  include the absence of operations-related execution risk. --A key to debt reduction over the next several years will be the continued  generation of strong free cash flow (FCF) at VZW. VZW's simple FCF (EBITDA less  capital spending) in 2013 was approximately $24.8 billion. VZ's consolidated FCF  (after dividends and capital spending but before distributions to Vodafone) was  $16.3 billion in 2013. Fitch estimates FCF will be at least 50% lower in 2014 as  a result of transaction-related interest costs, higher dividend requirements due  to the shares issued to Vodafone equity holders and higher cash taxes.  --The strong competitive position of VZW as evidenced by industry-low churn  rates, high margins and the most developed LTE network in the U.S. support  expectations for VZ's cash flow stability and the longer rating horizon embodied  in the rating.  VZ's gross leverage at year-end 2013 was 2.2x, with total debt at $93.6 billion.  Consolidated cash balances of $53.5 billion on Dec. 31, 2013 include proceeds  from the $49 billion of debt issued in September 2013 to finance the  transaction. As a result net leverage was only 1.0x.  VZ's liquidity is supported by a $6.2 billion credit facility. Fitch expects VZ  to maintain aggregate CP balances within a level fully backed by the facility.  The credit facility has no ratings triggers or other restrictive covenants, such  as leverage or interest coverage tests. In August 2013, the facility was  extended for a year and now matures in August 2017. After the effect of letters  of credit (LOCs), approximately $6.1 billion is available on the facility. The 364-day revolving credit facility has a 3.5x leverage covenant, as do the  term loans. The term loans leverage covenant falls away upon achieving 'A-'  ratings, as defined in the agreement. On a consolidated basis, VZ and its  subsidiaries have scheduled debt maturities of approximately $3.2 billion and  $2.6 billion in 2014 and 2015, respectively. In 2014, Fitch expects consolidated capital spending to range from $16.5 billion  to $17 billion, comparable to or slightly higher than the $16.6 billion spent in  2013. Investment in the wireless network continues to be an area of emphasis due  to the strong demand for 4G LTE capacity for rapidly growing data services.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch believes a positive rating action is unlikely in the foreseeable future,  given the leverage incurred in the Vodafone transaction. Conversely, Fitch may take negative rating action if: --Operating performance causes delevering to take place at a materially slower  than anticipated pace; --A weakening of VZW's competitive position that would jeopardize the stability  of cash flows.

48,"   By Marina Lopes | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Verizon Communications is in talks with content providers to deliver web-based TV services to mobile platforms, chief executive Lowell McAdam, said at an investor conference on Tuesday.A day earlier, Dish Network Corp and Walt Disney Co announced a landmark deal that will allow the No. 2 satellite TV provider to deliver Disney-owned network content online, outside of a traditional TV subscription.Verizon's goal ""is to work with the content providers,"" saidMcAdam at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media & Telecom Conference.

50,"  By Nicola LeskeNEW YORK, March 5 Masayoshi Son isn't used to taking no for an answer. But the Softbank Corp chief's pleas for a merger of the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless carriers seem to be falling on deaf ears.It is no secret that Son, known to have threatened self-immolation to get his way in the past, wants to combine Sprint Corp, which Softbank acquired last year, with T-Mobile US Inc as part of his vision to create a global industry leader.Son plans to lay out his broader vision for the U.S. wireless communications industry at the Chamber of Commerce in Washington, D.C. next Tuesday. Speculation is rife that he will talk about a bid for T-Mobile, although a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday that was not the plan.Anticipation about a merger has already pushed up shares of Sprint and T-Mobile 15.6 percent and 18.3 percent, respectively, since Dec. 13, when media reports first emerged about Softbank's interest in pursuing a deal as soon as the first half of 2014.Three sources familiar with the undertakings of the companies involved spoke on condition of anonymity for this article because they are not authorized to speak publicly about them.Son's advisors are telling him to cool his heels for the time being, given the low odds of gaining antitrust approval, after they met lawmakers and regulators over the past several weeks in Washington and consulted with T-Mobile's parent company, Deutsche Telekom.Son, who has eyed T-Mobile for years, would rather move sooner than later, before T-Mobile gets stronger and more expensive. He reiterated his interest in a deal just last week at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, according to the people familiar with the matter.""Everyone wants to do this deal; Sprint does, DT does, Softbank does, the investors want it, the customers want it; only the regulators don't want it,"" one of the sources said. Whether customers actually want or would benefit from a merger is debatable. Some consumer advocacy groups have warned it could result in higher prices, job losses and fewer choices for consumers.Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler also expressed his skepticism about a potential merger in meetings with Son and Sprint Chief Executive Dan Hesse on Feb. 3, according to an FCC official briefed on the matter.His viewpoint echoed earlier comments from William Baer, assistant attorney general for the antitrust division of the U.S. Department of Justice. Baer, at a meeting of the New York State Bar Association on Jan. 30, gave long odds to a regulatory approval of mergers between any two of the top four wireless phone companies.U.S. regulators previously rejected AT&T Inc's $39 billion takeover bid for T-Mobile US in 2011. They have since argued that T-Mobile US has grown stronger, proving that the market can sustain four companies. Additionally, the FCC is under pressure to maximize revenue from a spectrum auction scheduled for mid-2015. Proceeds from the auction will be used to compensate broadcasters and to contribute toward the building of a $7 billion national public safety communications network.For the auction, TV stations will voluntarily relinquish their low-frequency airwaves but their willingness to sell depends on the prices they can get, a reason for regulators to seek as many bidders as possible.Such airwaves can cover greater distances and penetrate walls and buildings more easily than high frequency spectrum, which makes them highly coveted, especially by wireless carriers Sprint and T-Mobile, which have less low-frequency spectrum than AT&T and Verizon Communications Inc.Deutsche Telekom would like to sell T-Mobile because it sees its fourth position in the United States, behind Verizon, AT&T and Sprint, as limiting long-term profitability. It does not want a repeat performance of its failed attempt to sell the unit to AT&T.Deutsche Telekom's new CEO Timotheus Hoettges was a key negotiator in that deal and knows the risks and costs involved in a failure better than anyone. He negotiated a breakup fee of cash and spectrum that amounted to $6 billion, but the company had to contend with an exodus of customers amid the uncertainty of waiting for regulatory approval that in the end never came. CULTURAL DIFFERENCES To be sure, Son, who once threatened to set himself on fire as he pushed Japanese regulators to let him set up a high speed Internet service, has shown he does not give up easily. That is why people close to Son still have not ruled out the possibility he will try a merger anyway this year.One of the sources, who has worked with Son, said he is learning how U.S. politics work and is still working on making his case despite the odds.""He's learning to deal with politics,"" the person said. ""His English is good but it's not nuanced so he says exactly what he thinks and that can be challenging in D.C. politics,"" the person added.Softbank's arguments are that a combination of the third and fourth mobile operators would create a strong competitor to AT&T and Verizon, the industry leaders.Looking outside the United States, Son can point to Britain and Australia as well as his home turf of Japan where regulators approved mergers between third- and fourth-ranking mobile players.Son has also argued that to build the super-fast network he envisions for the United States, it would only be economically viable were it to serve a larger subscriber base.Representatives for Softbank and Sprint have declined to comment on any potential deal with T-Mobile.",2014-03-05,VZ,"Wed Mar 5, 2014 | 6:22pm EST","DEALTALK-Softbank CEO's merger plans for Sprint, T-Mobile face long odds",http://www.reuters.com//article/softbank-son-sprint-tmobile-idUSL1N0M21UX20140305?type=companyNews

53,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 10 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating to Verizon  Communications Inc.'s (NYSE: VZ) proposed senior unsecured debt offering. Fitch currently rates VZ's IDR 'A-' with a Stable Rating Outlook. Proceeds from the notes will be used to fund notes tendered in connection with  concurrent, March 10, 2014 tender offers for up to $8.2 billion of outstanding  higher-cost debt previously issued by VZ or certain of its subsidiaries. If  proceeds exceed amounts needed to fund the notes tendered, the remaining  proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. KEY RATING DRIVERS --The February 2014 acquisition of the remaining Verizon Wireless (VZW) stake  pressures VZ's near-term credit metrics, pushing pro forma leverage at closing  to approximately 2.7x. With the close of the acquisition, Fitch expects VZ to  materially reduce debt over the next few years. EBITDA growth, combined with  debt reductions is expected to reduce leverage to approximately 2x by the end of  2016. Fitch believes this level is appropriate for an 'A-' rating. --While leverage will be outside an appropriate range for an 'A-' rating for  several years, Fitch believes metrics will return to a level appropriate for the  rating due to VZ's strong position in the wireless industry and the significant  cash flows generated by the wireless business. This is in combination with  Verizon management's commitment to delever, as evidenced by the aggressive  delevering following the acquisition of Alltel Corporation in early 2009. Other  supporting factors include the absence of operations-related execution risk. --A key to debt reduction over the next several years will be the continued  generation of strong free cash flow (FCF) at VZW. VZW's simple FCF (EBITDA less  capital spending) in 2013 was approximately $24.8 billion. VZ's consolidated FCF  (after dividends and capital spending but before distributions to Vodafone) was  $16.3 billion in 2013. Fitch estimates FCF will be at least 50% lower in 2014 as  a result of transaction-related interest costs, higher dividend requirements due  to the shares issued to Vodafone equity holders and higher cash taxes. --The strong competitive position of VZW as evidenced by industry-low churn  rates, high margins and the most developed LTE network in the U.S. support  expectations for VZ's cash flow stability and the longer rating horizon embodied  in the rating. VZ's gross leverage at year-end 2013 was 2.2x, with total debt at $93.6 billion.  Consolidated cash balances of $53.5 billion on Dec. 31, 2013 include proceeds  from the $49 billion of debt issued in September 2013 to finance the  transaction. As a result net leverage was only 1.0x. VZ's liquidity is supported by a $6.2 billion credit facility. Fitch expects VZ  to maintain aggregate CP balances within a level fully backed by the facility.  The credit facility has no ratings triggers or other restrictive covenants, such  as leverage or interest coverage tests. In August 2013, the facility was  extended for a year and now matures in August 2017. After the effect of letters  of credit (LOCs), approximately $6.1 billion is available on the facility. To provide additional liquidity, a $2 billion, 364-day revolving credit facility  became effective in February 2014. This facility has a 3.5x leverage covenant.  On a consolidated basis, VZ and its subsidiaries have scheduled debt maturities  of approximately $3.2 billion and $2.6 billion in 2014 and 2015, respectively. In 2014, Fitch expects consolidated capital spending to range from $16.5 billion  to $17 billion, comparable to or slightly higher than the $16.6 billion spent in  2013. Investment in the wireless network continues to be an area of emphasis due  to the strong demand for 4G LTE capacity for rapidly growing data services. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch believes a positive rating action is unlikely in the foreseeable future,  given the leverage incurred in the Vodafone transaction. Conversely, Fitch may take negative rating action if: --Operating performance causes delevering to take place at a materially slower  than anticipated pace; --A weakening of VZW's competitive position that would jeopardize the stability  of cash flows.

55,"  March 11 Japan's SoftBank Corp is still trying to buy T-Mobile US Inc and merge it with its U.S. wireless carrier Sprint Corp, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son said, even though U.S. regulators appear set against a deal.Son told U.S. TV show host Charlie Rose in an interview that if the deal goes through, he would launch a price war to break what he called a duopoly by dominant U.S. carriers AT&T Inc  and Verizon Communications Inc.""We would like to make the deal happen, but there are steps and details that we have to work out,"" said Son, who had previously declined to comment on whether Softbank was in talks to buy T-Mobile. ""We have to give it a shot."" Excerpts of the interview with the PBS network show were posted on YouTube. The show is scheduled to be broadcast late on Monday in the United States.The possibility of a merger between T-Mobile and Sprint, which was acquired by Softbank last year, was given the cold shoulder by regulators, with Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler expressing scepticism in meetings with Son and Sprint Chief Executive Dan Hesse on Feb. 3, according to an FCC official briefed on the matter. Regulators are concerned that reducing the number of major wireless carriers to three from four would hinder competition, but Son has argued that competition would be more robust if a  third strong player is created through the merger of smaller firms Sprint and T-Mobile. Softbank is now focused on convincing the parties involved with the merits of a merger, a senior company executive said, adding that any moves towards pursuing a deal were now on hold. The official declined to be named because he was not authorised to speak about the matter publicly.Son plans to present his vision for the U.S. wireless communications industry in a speech in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, although a person familiar with the matter said he would not talk about a bid for T-Mobile.",2014-03-11,VZ,"Tue Mar 11, 2014 | 3:10am EDT",SoftBank CEO says still keen to merge U.S. Sprint and T-Mobile,http://www.reuters.com//article/softbank-son-tmobile-idUSL3N0M81B820140311?type=companyNews
56,"  By Jim Finkle and Susan HeaveyBOSTON/WASHINGTON, March 13 Target Corp's  security software detected potentially malicious activity during last year's massive data breach, but its staff decided not to take immediate action, the No. 3. U.S. retailer said on Thursday.""With the benefit of hindsight, we are investigating whether if different judgments had been made the outcome may have been different,"" company spokeswoman Molly Snyder said in a statement.The disclosure came after Bloomberg Businessweek reported on Thursday that Target's security team in Bangalore had received alerts from a FireEye Inc security system on Nov. 30 after the attack was launched and sent them to Target headquarters in Minneapolis.The FireEye reports indicated malicious software had appeared in the system, according to a person whom Bloomberg Businessweek had consulted on Target's investigation but was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.The alert from FireEye labeled the threat with the generic name ""malware.binary,"" according to Bloomberg Businessweek. Two security experts who advise organizations in responding to cyber attacks and both have experience using FireEye technology said that security personnel typically don't get excited about such generic alerts because FireEye does not provide much information about those threats.The experts said that they believed it was likely that Target's security team received hundreds of such alerts on a daily basis, which would have made it tough to have singled out that threat as being particularly malicious.""They are bombarded with alerts. They get so many that they just don't respond to everything,"" said Shane Shook, an executive with Cylance Inc. ""It is completely understandable how this happened."" John Strand, owner of Black Hills Information Security, said that it was easy to paint Target as being incompetent, given the severity of the breach, but that it was not fair to do so.""Target is a huge organization. They probably get hundreds of these alerts a day,"" he said. ""We can always look for someone to blame. Sometimes it just doesn't work that way.""Target Chief Financial Officer John Mulligan told a congressional committee in February that the company only began investigating after on Dec. 12, when the U.S. Justice Department warned the company about suspicious activity involving payment cards. Within three days, nearly all the malicious software had been removed from Target's cash registers, he said. FOLLOW-UP DIDN'T SEEM WARRANTED ""Through our investigation, we learned that after these criminals entered our network, a small amount of their activity was logged and surfaced to our team. That activity was evaluated and acted upon,"" Snyder said. ""Based on their interpretation and evaluation of that activity, the team determined that it did not warrant immediate follow up.""Target shares fell 2 percent to $59.86 in late afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange after the company released the statement.Some 40 million payment card records were stolen from the retailer, along with 70 million other records with customer information such as addresses and telephone numbers. Congress is investigating the breach along with lapses at other retailers, and credit card companies were pushing for better security.Target also faces dozens of potential class-action lawsuits and action from banks that could seek reimbursement for millions of dollars in losses due to fraud and the cost of card replacements.A spokesman for FireEye declined to comment. FireEye  shares were up 1.8 percent at $79.05 on Nasdaq.Representatives for the U.S. Secret Service and Verizon Communications Inc, which are investigating Target's breach, declined to comment.FireEye has a function that automatically deletes malicious software, but it had been turned off by Target's security team before the hackers' attack, the Bloomberg report said, citing two people who audited FireEye's role after the breach.Shook and Strand said that the vast majority of FireEye's customers turn off that functionality because it is known for incorrectly flagging data as malware, which can halt email and Web traffic for business users.""FireEye ... is cutting edge,"" Strand said. ""But it takes love and care and feeding. You have to watch it and monitor it.""",2014-03-13,VZ,"Thu Mar 13, 2014 | 6:36pm EDT",UPDATE 2-Target says it declined to act on early alert of cyber breach,http://www.reuters.com//article/target-breach-idUSL2N0MA1MW20140313?type=companyNews

58,"  March 17 Vodafone Group Plc agreed to buy Spain's largest cable operator Ono for 7.2 billion euros ($10 billion) in the latest move by the British group to expand its European operations with a broadband offering.Having reaped a $130 billion windfall by selling its stake in Verizon Wireless to its partner Verizon Communications Inc , Vodafone was left with an acquisition war chest of as much as $40 billion even after distributing the majority of the sale proceeds to shareholders and investing billions in its network.Following is a chronology of key recent events involving Vodafone:* Feb 13 - Vodafone and Bharti Airtel buy Indian airwaves worth about $3 billion each in a hotly contested auction.* Feb 10 - Vodafone chief Vittorio Colao says group could have the capacity to spend between $30 billion and $40 billion on acquisitions in coming years and no deal should be too big if it makes strategic sense.

59,"  * Bond backing SFR buy to roadshow next week* Details emerge on maturities and pricing* Deal dubbed ""High-yield's Verizon""By Robert SmithLONDON, April 11 (IFR) - Numericable and Altice will start marketing a huge 10bn-equivalent high-yield bond package backing the acquisition of SFR on Monday, according to a banker close to the deal.On Saturday Numericable emerged victorious after a long bidding war with Bouygues for French telecom unit SFR, which Vivendi is disposing of. Numericable announced the 6.55bn loan component of the deal on Wednesday and has been meeting loan investors throughout this week.On Monday it will begin meeting bond investors to market 6.04bn-equivalent of bonds at the Numericable operating company level and 4.15bn-equivalent of bonds at the Altice holding company level. The tranches will be split into euro and dollars.JP Morgan is left-lead on the opco bond and Goldman Sachs left-lead on the holdco bond.Maturities have not been formally announced and are subject to change, but most of the debt will be for eight-years. The opco bond should have five-year, eight-year and 10-year maturities, according to the banker, while the holdco issue should be solely eight-years. HIGH-YIELD'S VERIZON The deal's size is virtually unprecedented in the European high-yield market, and will rapidly eclipse Wind Telecom's 3.75bn-equivalent deal on Tuesday, the previous largest European high-yield bond of 2014.Still, demand is expected to be fierce. ""Loads of people are already putting in orders for the deal and it's not even been formally announced yet,"" said the banker.""This could be the Verizon of the high-yield market.""Much like Verizon's US$49bn investment grade bond priced last year, market sources expect Numericable and Altice will have to pay up to clear such a large amount of paper. ""Most people are pegging it at a low 6% yield for the opco and low 8% yield for the holdco,"" said a high-yield investor.""The opco could come inside 5% but I don't think it will. They need to pay us to clear so many billions of bonds in one go.""Pricing on the holdco bond is complicated by the fact that it not only sits above Numericable but also sits above Altice VII. Altice VII is the entity that has raised debt financing over the past year and contains its cable businesses in Israel, Portugal, and the French Overseas Territories among others.The banker said that, as a result, there are a range of opinions on price and no one is sure quite where final pricing will end up. ""Wind's deal this week is probably the best comp, and no one expected that to come as tight as 7%,"" he added.PIK TOGGLE OPTION? The investor argued that as the Altice holdco sits above a lot of existing debt with the ability to trap cash, then it would have made more sense to issue a PIK toggle.PIK toggles are a variation on payment-in-kind notes, which pay coupons in cash if the issuer can, while leaving it the option of allowing interest to accrue on the principal if it cannot.""A PIK toggle would have given the company more flexibility, but it's not needed as they are very comfortable on being able to pay cash,"" said the banker.""A 4bn PIK toggle would be a very difficult deal to sell to investors anyway.""German vehicle parts supplier Schaeffler issued the largest publicly placed PIK toggle last year, and at 1.5bn-equivalent this was not even half size of the Altice holdco bond.The Altice Group is a multinational cable and telecommunications company with a presence in France, Israel, Belgium & Luxembourg, Portugal, French Overseas Territories and Switzerland.

60,"  * Deal dubbed ""high-yield's Verizon""* Altice bond uses complex holdco structure* Bonds to price after Easter break, demand expected to be strong   (Adds quotes, background)By Robert SmithLONDON, April 14 (IFR) - Numericable and Altice will test the limits of the high-yield bond market later this month with a 10bn-equivalent bond financing for their acquisition of French telecom unit SFR from Vivendi.The jumbo bond package, which has been dubbed ""the Verizon of the high-yield market"", will be split into 6.04bn-equivalent of bonds at the Numericable operating company level, and 4.15bn-equivalent of bonds at the Altice holding company level. Both will be split into euro and dollar tranches.These kind of sizes tend to be seen in the investment-grade market, which has shown great depth for M&A financing in the past, but they are far less common in high-yield.As IFR reported on Friday, the Numericable bond is split into five-, eight- and 10-year tranches, while the Altice bond is solely eight-year debt.The Numericable bonds are senior secured first lien notes, split into five-year non-call two, eight-year non-call three and 10-year non-call five tranches. The five-year bond will have 500m and US$920m tranches, while the eight- and 10-year bonds will both be split into 1bn and US$2bn tranches.The Altice bonds are eight-year non-call three senior notes, but the dollar and euro split is yet to be determined.Despite its large size, demand for the deal is expected to be fierce. A banker close to the trade said on Friday that many investors were already putting in orders, even though the bond had not yet been officially announced.""People are already saying this could be the Verizon of the high-yield market,"" he added. Verizon made history in September 2013 with a record-breaking US$49bn deal that received more than US$100bn of orders.The liquidity in the European high-yield market is deepening, with European high-yield bond funds seeing an unbroken streak of weekly inflows for the past seven months, according to JP Morgan data.Italy's Wind Telecom 3.75bn-equivalent senior bond deal that priced last week is testament to this much improved liquidity, with one banker saying that orders for the 1.75bn euro tranche alone topped 10bn. COMPLEX STRUCTURE The deal's complex structure will require intense credit work for potential investors, however. Numericable's bond offering memorandum is more than 650 pages long, while the Altice offering memorandum runs to nearly double that at more than 1,100 pages.The Altice holdco bond is particularly complex, as it not only sits above the new Numericable-SFR business but also Altice International, which has operations in far-flung geographies such as Israel and the Dominican Republic.The Numericable-SFR business will have net debt of 11.7bn-equivalent, while Altice International has net debt of 3.5bn-equivalent. Investors will have to be confident that there will be enough cash left over after servicing this debt to pay the coupons on the new 4.15bn-equivalent debt at the holdco level.Altice estimates that the holdco will incur cash interest  expenses of 325m, but that 967m of cash from Numericable-SFR and Altice International will be left over to service this.Investor meetings start today in London, with a lunch hosted by Altice's founder Patrick Drahi. Altice's CEO Dexter Goei and its CFO Dennis Okhuijsen will also be in attendance, as will Numericable's CEO Eric Denoyer and its CFO Thierry Lemaitre.A second meeting in London will follow on Tuesday morning, before the roadshow moves to the United States from Tuesday to Thursday. A final day of meetings will be held after the Easter break on April 22 in Paris and Frankfurt, with pricing of the deal expected on April 23.JP Morgan is lead-left bookrunner on the Numericable opco bond, while Goldman Sachs is lead-left on the Altice holdco bond. The pair are global coordinators on both tranches, along with Deutsche Bank. Deutsche Bank is left-lead on the EUR6.55bn-equivalent loan component on the deal.

61,"   By Alina Selyukh | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The top U.S. telecommunications regulator on Thursday reasserted his commitment to helping smaller national wireless carriers get access to valuable lower-frequency airwaves in the upcoming spectrum auction.Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler, in a letter to Representative John Barrow, reaffirmed his plans to restrict how much spectrum the biggest U.S. carriers, Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc, could buy in the auction scheduled for mid-2015.""The Incentive Auction offers the opportunity, possibly the last for years to come, to make low-band spectrum available to any mobile wireless provider, in any market, that is willing and able to compete at auction,"" Wheeler wrote to Barrow.""At the same time, a priority of the auction should be to assure that companies that already possess low-band spectrum do not exploit the auction to keep competitors from accessing the spectrum necessary to provide competition,"" he also wrote.Wheeler's letter comes a day after AT&T, the No. 2 wireless provider, threatened to sit out the auction altogether over the regulator's proposed restrictions.Wheeler's plan would reserve part of the spectrum, up to 30 megahertz, in each market for bidding only by carriers that control less than one-third of low-frequency airwaves there. The reserve would kick in only after the auction reaches a particular trigger, which will be established in coming months, according to people briefed on the proposal. The plan is expected to be formally circulated at the FCC later this month and voted on at the May 15 public meeting.The rules would benefit the No. 3 and No. 4 nation-wide carriers Sprint Corp and T-Mobile USA as they would largely restrict Verizon and AT&T, which Wheeler said control some two-thirds of those frequencies across the country.In the letter, Wheeler argued that the smaller national carriers need a boost in getting low-band spectrum to provide more and better rural coverage, and to correct what he called ""the historical accident of previous spectrum assignments."" Critics have argued that Sprint and T-Mobile both had a chance to acquire more low-band spectrum in the past but for various reasons chose not to  so. They also say that restricting the biggest providers amounts to regulators picking winners and losers.AT&T, in a filing disclosed on Wednesday, expressed concerns that having 30 MHz of spectrum out of bounds for some carriers may mean that in some markets, only one restricted bidder - presumably either AT&T or Verizon - would have an opportunity to buy a block of airwaves large enough to deploy LTE technology.""Such restrictions would put AT&T in an untenable position, forcing AT&T to reevaluate its potential participation in the auction,"" Joan Marsh, AT&T's vice president of federal regulator, said in the filing. Though AT&T's threat of auction boycott on Wednesday was seen by some observers as a bluff, lack of the carrier's participation could put a squeeze on how much cash the FCC raises in the sale of airwaves.Congress has required the FCC to raise enough money to pay back TV stations for giving up the airwaves that will be sold in the auction and fund a new $7 billion public safety network.""Companies are free to advocate the views that are in their best interest, but the public interest is not measured against the business model of one or two companies; it is measured against the ability of the market to deliver the benefits of competition to Americans in urban, suburban and rural America alike,"" an FCC official said on Thursday.Wheeler's letter was in response to one on Monday from Barrow, a Democrat from Georgia, and 77 other lawmakers in the House that encouraged the FCC as it prepares for the auction.(Reporting by Alina Selyukh; Editing by Marguerita Choy)",2014-04-17,VZ,"Thu Apr 17, 2014 | 3:55pm EDT","U.S. regulator reasserts goal to restrict AT&T, Verizon in auction",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-wireless-fcc-idUSBREA3G1VW20140417?type=companyNews
62,"  * Planned spectrum auction rules could crimp big carriers* Proposed deal would merge Nos. 3-4 U.S. wireless carriers* A tie-up would reshape wireless sector   (New throughout, adds closing share price, background on possible merger)By Alina SelyukhWASHINGTON, April 17 A possible merger between Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US Inc could prompt U.S. regulators to rewrite rules they are now weighing for a 2015 auction of airwaves, according to sources familiar with the proposed regulations.Sprint's parent company has been exploring a possible tie-up with T-Mobile, although  no proposal has been announced. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler has proposed restrictions on how much the biggest carriers, Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc, could bid in the major auction of television spectrum scheduled for mid-2015.The auction offers carriers a chance to buy access to airwaves that are valued for their strength and reach. Wheeler's proposal has yet to be formally circulated among other FCC commissioners but would reserve up to 30 megahertz of spectrum in each market for carriers who do not already dominate the lower frequencies there - in most cases, Verizon and AT&T.However, as in many other proceedings, the FCC's rules would be based on the ""current market structure."" Any changes or proposed changes in that structure that could undermine the goals of the auction would prompt a review and potential edits, said sources briefed on the proposed rules.That means if Japan's SoftBank Corp, Sprint's parent company, forges ahead with its goal of merging the No. 3 wireless carrier with No. 4 provider T-Mobile, the FCC could eliminate the reserve set off for smaller competitors, sources said. Some regulators, including Wheeler, have been skeptical of a potential merger because it would reduce the number of major U.S. wireless carriers to three from four. SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son has argued that a stronger third player would create more competition for AT&T and Verizon.FCC commissioners will review the draft rules in coming weeks and are expected to propose them on May 15.

63,"  * Planned 2015 spectrum auction rules could put restrictions on largest carriers* Sprint/T-Mobile deal would combine Nos. 3-4 U.S. wireless carriers* A tie-up would reshape current market structure of wireless sectorBy Alina SelyukhWASHINGTON, April 17 A planned merger of Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US Inc could prompt U.S. regulators to rewrite rules they are now weighing for a 2015 auction of airwaves, according to sources familiar with the proposed plan.Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler has proposed restrictions on how much the biggest carriers, Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc, could bid in the major auction of television spectrum scheduled for mid-2015. The auction offers carriers a chance to buy access to airwaves that are valued for their strength and reach.Wheeler's proposal has yet to be formally circulated among other FCC commissioners but would reserve up to 30 megahertz of spectrum in each market for carriers who do not already dominate the lower frequencies there - in most cases, Verizon and AT&T.However, as in many other proceedings, the FCC's rules would be based on the ""current market structure."" Any changes or proposed changes in that structure that could undermine the goals of the auction would prompt a review and potential edits, said sources briefed on the proposed rules. That means if SoftBank Corp, Sprint's parent company, moves ahead with its goal of merging the No. 3 wireless carrier with No. 4 provider T-Mobile, the FCC could eliminate the reserve set off for smaller competitors, sources said.FCC commissioners will review the draft rules in coming weeks and are expected to propose them on May 15.

64,"  (Adds further details of Wheeler's letter, proposed rules and AT&T opposition)By Alina SelyukhWASHINGTON, April 17 The top U.S. telecommunications regulator on Thursday reasserted his commitment to helping smaller national wireless carriers get access to valuable lower-frequency airwaves in the upcoming spectrum auction.Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler, in a letter to Representative John Barrow, reaffirmed his plans to restrict how much spectrum the biggest U.S. carriers, Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc, could buy in the auction scheduled for mid-2015.""The Incentive Auction offers the opportunity, possibly the last for years to come, to make low-band spectrum available to any mobile wireless provider, in any market, that is willing and able to compete at auction,"" Wheeler wrote to Barrow.""At the same time, a priority of the auction should be to assure that companies that already possess low-band spectrum do not exploit the auction to keep competitors from accessing the spectrum necessary to provide competition,"" he also wrote.Wheeler's letter comes a day after AT&T, the No. 2 wireless provider, threatened to sit out the auction altogether over the regulator's proposed restrictions. Wheeler's plan would reserve part of the spectrum, up to 30 megahertz, in each market for bidding only by carriers that control less than one-third of low-frequency airwaves there.The reserve would kick in only after the auction reaches a particular trigger, which will be established in coming months, according to people briefed on the proposal. The plan is expected to be formally circulated at the FCC later this month and voted on at the May 15 public meeting.The rules would benefit the No. 3 and No. 4 nation-wide carriers Sprint Corp and T-Mobile USA as they would largely restrict Verizon and AT&T, which Wheeler said control some two-thirds of those frequencies across the country. In the letter, Wheeler argued that the smaller national carriers need a boost in getting low-band spectrum to provide more and better rural coverage, and to correct what he called  ""the historical accident of previous spectrum assignments.""Critics have argued that Sprint and T-Mobile both had a chance to acquire more low-band spectrum in the past but for various reasons chose not to to so. They also say that restricting the biggest providers amounts to regulators picking winners and losers.AT&T, in a filing disclosed on Wednesday, expressed concerns that having 30 MHz of spectrum out of bounds for some carriers may mean that in some markets, only one restricted bidder - presumably either AT&T or Verizon - would have an opportunity to buy a block of airwaves large enough to deploy LTE technology. ""Such restrictions would put AT&T in an untenable position, forcing AT&T to reevaluate its potential participation in the auction,"" Joan Marsh, AT&T's vice president of federal regulator, said in the filing.Though AT&T's threat of auction boycott on Wednesday was seen by some observers as a bluff, lack of the carrier's participation could put a squeeze on how much cash the FCC raises in the sale of airwaves.Congress has required the FCC to raise enough money to pay back TV stations for giving up the airwaves that will be sold in the auction and fund a new $7 billion public safety network.""Companies are free to advocate the views that are in their best interest, but the public interest is not measured against the business model of one or two companies; it is measured against the ability of the market to deliver the benefits of competition to Americans in urban, suburban and rural America alike,"" an FCC official said on Thursday.Wheeler's letter was in response to one on Monday from Barrow, a Democrat from Georgia, and 77 other lawmakers in the House that encouraged the FCC as it prepares for the auction.

About 25 percent of spying incidents could not be attributed to attackers from any country, according to the authors of the report.Though the overall number of spying incidents studied tripled to 511 from total in the 2013 Verizon report, most of that increase is due to the addition of new data sources.

68,"  (Adds order will not address interconnection deals, details of court ruling)By Alina SelyukhWASHINGTON, April 23 U.S. regulators are expected to vote on May 15 on a new set of so-called ""net neutrality"" rules aimed at making certain that broadband providers do not slow down or block consumers' access to legal Internet content.Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler on Wednesday said he plans to circulate his proposed rules among other commissioners on Thursday, teeing them up for a vote at the FCC's May 15 meeting. The draft rules will then be formally proposed and available for public comment.The rules are expected to ensure that network operators disclose exactly how they manage Internet traffic and do not restrict consumers as they surf the Web. Wheeler has also said he planned to take a case-by-case approach to reviewing the practices adopted by Internet providers.However, the rules are not expected to address the issue of interconnection, or agreements in which content companies pay network providers for faster access to their sites or services. That issue was recently brought into the spotlight by a tussle between video streaming service Netflix Inc and cable company Comcast Corp.Wheeler in the past has reaffirmed that net neutrality rules would not regulate deals between businesses on connections before they reach the user as the scope of the rules is limited to the last leg of the network that reaches the consumer.Virtually all large Internet service providers, such as Verizon Communications Inc and Time Warner Cable Inc , have pledged to abide by the principles of open Internet reinforced by these rules. But critics have raised concerns that, without a formal rule, the voluntary pledges could be pulled back over time and also leave the door open for deals that would give unequal treatment to websites or services.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in January for the second time struck down the FCC's previous version of the open Internet order.However, the court did affirm that the FCC had authority to regulate broadband, giving the agency new legal opportunity to bring back non-discrimination and no-blocking regulations for Internet service providers. Comcast, through conditions placed on its 2011 merger with NBC Universal, is the only Internet provider still bound by the earlier FCC net neutrality rules through 2018.Comcast has now proposed to buy its biggest rival Time Warner Cable Inc and Netflix has come out in opposition of the $45.2 billion merger, arguing that the Internet provider should be banned from charging fees for delivering its content.Comcast has said that Netflix's opposition was ""based on inaccurate claims and arguments.""Netflix, which accounts for much of Internet traffic during peak hours, in February struck a deal to pay Comcast for faster online delivery of its movies and TV shows.Some companies pay Internet service providers or other firms that serve as intermediaries to better deliver traffic to users.

Apple also approved another $30 billion stock-buyback plan, raised its dividend and authorized a seven-for-one stock split.The S&P information technology index rose 1.1 percent and was the best-performing sector of the day.The three major U.S. stock indexes had opened sharply higher, with the Nasdaq initially climbing more than 1 percent before turning negative in the first half-hour of trading. Wall Street bounced off session lows with gains again concentrated in the Nasdaq, but stocks finished the day well off earlier highs. Much of the volatility was driven by comments from Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, who said Russia started military drills near the border with Ukraine. Ukrainian forces killed up to five pro-Moscow rebels as they closed in on the separatists' military stronghold in the east.""The market is biased - from all of the good news we've heard on stocks recently - to go higher,"" said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.""However, there are hot spots in the world that keep flaring up like a campfire that won't go out, and the market needs to deal with that.""Caterpillar Inc rose 1.8 percent to $105.28 after the company reported better-than-expected earnings and raised its full-year profit outlook.

Verizon dropped 2.4 percent to $46.28, while 3M fell 1 percent to $136.65.The S&P telecom index lost 1.7 percent. The index has dropped 3.8 percent over the past two days, its worst two-session performance since June.The Dow Jones industrial average remained unchanged to close at 16,501.65.

70,"  (Recasts throughout with additional details of FCC proposal)By Alina SelyukhNEW YORK, April 24 The U.S. communications regulator on Thursday sought to tame an outcry over its plan to allow ""fast lanes"" for some content on the Internet, insisting that the agency will monitor and punish broadband providers that treat Web traffic ""unreasonably.""The Federal Communications Commission is weighing rules that would ban Internet providers from blocking access to websites or applications, but would allow content companies to pay for faster Internet speeds delivering their traffic as long as such deals are deemed ""commercially reasonable.""Consumer advocates assailed the proposal from FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, saying it would let certain content providers pay for access to fast lanes and discourage consumers from going to competitors' sites where videos or other content may load more slowly by comparison.The five-member FCC will negotiate the rules before they vote on May 15 to formally propose them and seek public comment.""This move is likely to favor the companies with the deepest pockets and hurt the scrappy start-ups,"" Delara Derakhshani, policy counsel for Consumers Union, said in a statement.The debate is over the principle known as open Internet or net neutrality, which establishes that owners of networks that deliver online content should treat all of that content equally. ""There are reports that the FCC is gutting the Open Internet rule. They are flat-out wrong,"" Wheeler said in a statement late on Wednesday. In a blog post on Thursday, he said the rules, which he intends to finalize by year-end, would not change the FCC's ""underlying goals of transparency"" or harm consumers.The FCC for years has struggled to set rules that would prohibit Internet providers from restricting how consumers surf the Web but would also withstand legal challenges from broadband providers who have said they, as owners of the networks, should be able to manage them or charge for their use without what they see as regulatory overreach.In January, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for the second time struck down the FCC's previous anti-discrimination and anti-blocking rules after a challenge from Verizon Communications Inc. But the judges did affirm the agency's authority to regulate broadband, giving the FCC new legal opportunity to rewrite the rules. It was the court's direction that guided Wheeler's proposal to allow commercially reasonable preferential treatment of traffic, senior FCC officials said on Thursday.The agency will seek public comment before determining how to define ""commercially unreasonable"" behavior or a violation of ""net neutrality,"" but it will focus on whether broadband companies' treatment of traffic hurts competitors or consumers, hurts free speech or is done in good faith, the officials said.The FCC would have the authority to go after companies that violate the commercially reasonable standard on a case-by-case basis. The review would be prompted by formal or informal complaints as well as the FCC's own monitoring of how broadband providers treat online traffic, the officials said.One of the ideas the FCC is considering would be to have a commission ombudsperson to monitor the industry with consumers and content providers in mind, one FCC official said. In striking down the FCC's old rules, the court said the agency had improperly treated Internet service providers as regulated public utilities providing telecommunications services, like telephone companies, while they were actually classified as information service providers.Consumer advocates have called on the FCC to reclassify Internet providers as more heavily regulated telecommunications services, an idea that has faced tremendous pushback from the broadband industry and Republican lawmakers who have urged the FCC to tread lightly.Virtually all large Internet providers, such as Verizon, AT&T Inc and Time Warner Cable Inc, pledged after January's ruling to continue abiding by the principles of open Internet and have not weighed in since then.The fees that content providers pay for faster access to their sites or applications recently grabbed the spotlight after video streaming service Netflix Inc struck a deal known as an interconnection agreement with cable provider Comcast Corp  in February.However, such deals are struck on the back end of the network that gets content from a server to the broadband network and so are outside of the scope of the FCC's net neutrality rules. The rules have only applied to deals related to traffic going over the ""last mile"" of broadband networks, where content moves directly to the user.(Reporting by Alina Selyukh,; Editing by Doina Chiacu, Richard Chang and Tom Brown)",2014-04-24,VZ,"Thu Apr 24, 2014 | 6:45pm EDT",UPDATE 2-FCC pushes back against criticism over Internet traffic plan,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-netneutrality-fcc-idUSL2N0NG1DR20140424?type=companyNews

78,"  (This story originally appeared on IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication)By Danielle RobinsonNEW YORK, April 28 (IFR) - Apple is planning to hit the markets once again in the near future, to raise at least as much as the US$17bn it raised a year ago, but it is possible that giant asset managers could persuade it to double that amount and do a Verizon-style mega-deal that is generously priced.The company said on its earnings call in the past week that ""we plan to be active in both the domestic and international bond markets during 2014 for an amount of term debt financing similar to what we issued in 2013"".Apple has just increased its authorised share buybacks by US$30bn, to US$90bn by the end of 2015. Like its US$17bn deal a year ago, it is keen to issue more debt as a way of leveraging its offshore cash balances.Already, some investors have calculated that Apple could add a further US$30bn-$40bn of debt to its balance sheet without hurting its Double A rating.""They are talking about doing another US$15bn or US$20bn, but we think they will do another US$15bn to US$20bn after that,"" said Chuck Burge, senior portfolio manager overseeing US$15bn of assets under management at Invesco.Such a large overhang could be used by investors, along with the shareholder-friendly use of proceeds and the lacklustre performance of its original deal, to squeeze decent new-issue concessions out of a new dollar deal - or better still, convince the tech giant to just get all of its funding plans done in one hit. ""Apple could use the Verizon deal as a model of how to structure this new transaction,"" said Burge. ""Verizon went to investors and started saying, we would like to do an M&A deal of around US$20bn-$25bn, and then they got the idea that they could take care of all of their financing needs in one hit at a price that investors wanted.""Apple priced its first deal with little to no new-issue concession last April, only to see its longer-dated tranches plunge by more than eight points in price at one stage when then Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke first hinted in May at tapering the Fed's QE bond buying programme.Total return investors' bitter experience with the Apple deal was one of the reasons why Verizon needed to offer huge new-issue spread cushions, especially on the long-dated tranches of its record US$49bn offering in September. STARK CONTRAST Now, the execution strategies of the Apple and Verizon deals stand in stark contrast to one another in the minds of investors.Apple squeezed on price and, apart from its short-dated tranches, its bonds have never really outperformed. Its 3.85% 2043s still trade below par at 89 and wider than the Treasuries 100bp new-issue spread - at plus 105bp. Verizon's US$15bn 6.55% September 2043 tranche, on the other hand, was priced with a 90bp new-issue concession and reaped investors billions of dollars of profits immediately. It has been a stunning outperformer, currently trading at US$124.00 bid or 154bp over Treasuries, from a new-issue spread of 265bp.Apple could counter the overhang argument, at least, by insisting it will only issue a certain amount of term debt in US dollars this year.Moody's has also just given Apple a P-1 commercial paper rating and expects it will issue up to US$10bn in CP. Moody's also warned that if Apple borrowed ""meaningfully more"" than the incremental US$25bn that it needs to pay for share repurchases, then ""that would be credit-negative and could pressure the long-term rating down"".The demand for high-grade bonds is also so immense, both in the US and in euros and sterling, that many think Apple will be able to issue in sizes and currencies that reap the best cost of funds.""There is just huge appetite for paper, so much so that a new deal would probably be done easily and at a very nice level for the company,"" said Mirko Mikelic, senior portfolio manager for Fifth Third Bank's ClearArc Capital.According to Michael Collins, senior portfolio manager at Prudential, demand technicals continue to reach new heights.""It feels like we are entering into a new phase of the credit cycle, where issuers are taking advantage of stable rates to increase leverage, underwriting standards have arguably gotten worse in some cases and investors are falling over themselves to get bonds,"" Collins said.

81,"  WASHINGTON May 1 Verizon Communications Inc  has urged U.S. regulators not to restrict how much it can buy in next year's auction of wireless spectrum, saying such a limit would subsidize the smallest national carriers and their foreign owners.Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler recently proposed rules for the complex sale of valuable airwaves scheduled for mid-2015. The rules would reserve part of the spectrum in each market for wireless carriers that do not already have dominant blocks of low-frequency airwaves there.That would benefit the No. 3 and No. 4 carriers, Sprint Corp  and T-Mobile US Inc, by limiting the two biggest carriers, Verizon and AT&T Inc, which dominate the highly valued low-band spectrum.The sale is considered one of the most complex undertakings by the FCC. It would first involve TV stations' giving up airwaves they exclusively use and the FCC then auctioning them off to wireless carriers. Congress has mandated that the FCC raise enough money to pay broadcasters for their lost spectrum and fund a new $7 billion public safety network.Verizon on Monday pushed back against the proposed rules in meetings with Ajit Pai and Mike O'Rielly, the FCC's two Republican commissioners, who have also expressed concerns about the proposed restrictions, according to an FCC disclosure  posted online on Thursday. AT&T last month told Wheeler's staff that it may choose to sit out the auction if such rules are adopted, though it later told investors that outcome would not be ideal.""Verizon stressed that it would be perverse and unjust for the commission to adopt auction rules that subsidize some large multinational companies at the expense of their competitors,"" Verizon said in Thursday's filing, referring to Sprint's Japanese parent, SoftBank Corp, and T-Mobile's German parent, Deutsche Telekom AG. ""T-Mobile and Sprint are large corporations with established, well-financed corporate parents. They and their parent corporations are more than capable of paying substantial amounts to acquire spectrum in the incentive auction if they choose to do so,"" Verizon said.Wheeler has repeatedly asserted that his goal is to ensure that non-dominant carriers in each market get some low-frequency spectrum. His plan would reserve up to 30 megahertz of airwaves in each market for carriers that do not already have one-third of low-band spectrum there, whether that be Verizon, AT&T or a regional carrier. The reserve would kick in only after the auction reaches a particular trigger, which will be established in coming months.The FCC is slated to vote on formally proposing the rules at its May 15 meeting.(Reporting by Alina Selyukh, editing by Ros Krasny)",2014-05-01,VZ,"Thu May 1, 2014 | 2:55pm EDT",Verizon to FCC: Restrictions on airwaves auction are unjust,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-wireless-spectrum-verizon-comms-idUSL2N0NN14P20140501?type=companyNews

84,"  (Adds analyst comment on Verizon, details on Wal-Mart, Buffett portfolio)NEW YORK May 15 Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc bought a new stake of 11 million shares in Verizon Communications Inc in the first quarter and added to its holding in Wal-Mart Stores Inc, according to a regulatory filing on Thursday.Shares of Verizon rose 1.6 percent to $48.75 in after-hours trading following the disclosure, in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing, detailing Berkshire's U.S. common stock investments as of March 31.Shares of companies often rise after Berkshire reveals new stakes because some investors consider it a vote of confidence by Buffett and try to copy him.Verizon ""has shown that with several changes in leadership, the company performs and is a premium provider, if not the premium provider in the market,"" said analyst Roger Entner of Recon Analytics in Boston.Buffett ""likes people who can execute,"" Entner added.Investor Daniel Loeb's Third Point LLC also opened a new stake in Verizon, buying 3.5 million shares. Verizon declined to comment.Berkshire's regulatory filing did not say whether the Verizon investment was made by Buffett himself, or by one or both of his portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler.U.S. regulators require large investors to disclose their stock holdings every quarter, and the disclosures can offer a window into their investment strategies. Berkshire, a conglomerate with over 80 businesses ranging from ice cream to insurance, added to stakes in other companies, as well, including DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc and IBM Corp, among others.Berkshire Hathaway reduced its stake in several companies, among them DirecTV and General Motors Co.It also reported a 17.3 percent boost in its stake in Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the world's largest retailer, to 58.1 million shares, for a total of $4.44 billion. Though Berkshire owns several retail businesses such as Fruit of the Loom and the Nebraska Furniture Mart, Buffett is not known for specializing in that sector.Asked at Berkshire's annual meeting on May 3 about when he goes out of his ""circle of confidence"" when investing, Buffett said ""I've gone out of it more often in retail.""The Omaha, Nebraska-based company's book value per share, Buffett's preferred measure of growth, grew 2.6 percent from January to March this year.The conglomerate ended the first quarter with $118.5 billion in stock, more than half of which was in four companies: American Express Company, Wells Fargo, IBM and the Coca-Cola Company.While Buffett has said he makes Berkshire's largest investments, some investments are made by Combs and Weschler, who oversee several billion dollars each.In afternoon trading, Berkshire's Class A shares slipped 1.07 percent to $189,371 and its Class B shares dipped 0.92 percent to $126.36.

85,"   By Alina Selyukh and Marina Lopes  U.S. telecom regulators on Thursday voted to limit how much spectrum Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc will be able to buy in next year's auction of highly valuable wireless airwaves.In a 3-2 vote along party lines, the Federal Communications Commission approved a plan that would reserve part of the spectrum in each market for carriers that do not already have substantial blocks of low-frequency airwaves there, largely restricting the participation of Verizon and AT&T.Sprint Corp and T-Mobile USA Inc had urged the FCC to ensure their two biggest rivals did not dominate the auction. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler had agreed, saying last month that Verizon and AT&T already controlled almost two-thirds of the coveted low-frequency airwaves.The final rules, however, represent something of a compromise that reserves some airwaves for smaller carriers while ensuring that larger providers would be able to get sizeable chunks of spectrum in the unreserved portion.The FCC's rules are based on current market structure, meaning that if Sprint acquires T-Mobile, for example, the rules would be revisited and could be rewritten.

The rules set on Thursday would reserve up to 30 megahertz of spectrum in each market for bidding by non-nationwide carriers or companies with less than one-third of low-band spectrum in that market.The reserve would kick in after the auction raises enough spectrum and revenue to help fund a new $7 billion public safety network and pay back TV stations, which would volunteer to relinquish airwaves for wireless carriers to buy in the auction. Verizon and AT&T applauded the compromised plan and AT&T said it plans on bidding at least $9 billion for 20 MHz in the incentive auction.Verizon and AT&T had strongly opposed the plan, arguing it was unfair, would complicate the auction and could hurt how much money the FCC ultimately raises in the sale.The FCC also voted along party lines to expand the so-called spectrum screen, a calculation of what airwaves are usable for wireless, to include more of the airwaves currently controlled by Sprint and Dish Network Corp, among other things.Any spectrum acquisitions involving low-frequency airwaves or deals that tip one company over one-third of the screen in a market would trigger extra scrutiny.(Reporting by Marina Lopes; Editing by Paul Simao and Dan Grebler)",2014-05-15,VZ,"Thu May 15, 2014 | 5:59pm EDT","FCC votes to restrict AT&T, Verizon in 2015 spectrum auction",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-wireless-fcc-idUSBREA4E0RF20140515?type=companyNews

88,"   By Alina Selyukh | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON May 15 U.S. telecommunications regulators will vote on Thursday on whether to formally propose new ""net neutrality"" rules that may let Internet service providers charge content companies for faster and more reliable delivery of their traffic to users.Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler has come under fire from consumer advocates and technology companies for proposing to allow some ""commercially reasonable"" deals where content companies could pay broadband providers to prioritize traffic on their networks.Critics worry the rules would create ""fast lanes"" for companies that pay up and mean slower traffic for others, although Wheeler has pledged to prevent ""acts to divide the Internet between 'haves' and 'have nots.'""Some 200 activists have said they plan to protest at the FCC on Thursday, joining a few hard core critics who have camped outside the agency for a week. Consumer advocates were also mobilizing Internet users to protest online on blogs and through social media. Those advocates want the FCC to reclassify Internet providers as utilities, like telephone companies, rather than as the less-regulated information services they are now. That move is opposed by broadband companies and Republicans, both in Congress and at the FCC.Opponents, including House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner and CEOs of major Internet providers, told Wheeler that stricter regulations would throw the industry into legal limbo, discourage investment in network infrastructure and still not prevent pay-for-priority deals. House Democrats have come out on both sides of the reclassification issue in recent communications to Wheeler.More than 100 technology companies, including Google Inc  and Facebook Inc, have spoken out against allowing pay-for-priority, although have not called for reclassification. Wheeler's proposal reaches the tentative conclusion that some pay-for-priority deals may be allowed, but asks whether the FCC should presume ""some or all"" such deals are illegal, according to an FCC official briefed on the proposal. It also asks whether the FCC should instead consider reclassification or other net neutrality proposals.The two Republican FCC commissioners are expected to vote against Wheeler's proposal. Wheeler's two fellow Democrats have both expressed misgivings about the plan, but are likely to vote  to launch the process and open it up to public comment.The FCC will also vote on Thursday on rules for the sale of highly valuable low-frequency airwaves to wireless carriers. Those rules are expected to restrict how much the largest two providers, Verizon and AT&T, can buy.    (Reporting by Alina Selyukh.

92,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 29 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating to Verizon  Communications Inc.'s (NYSE: VZ) proposed senior unsecured exchange notes due  2024. VZ will commence an offer to exchange up to GBP600 million of 8.875% notes  due 2018 previously issued by Cellco Partnership and Verizon Wireless Capital  LLC for the new VZ notes and cash. Fitch's current Issuer Default Rating for VZ  is 'A-' with a Stable Rating Outlook. KEY RATING DRIVERS --The February 2014 acquisition of the remaining Verizon Wireless (VZW) stake  pressures VZ's near-term credit metrics, pushing pro forma leverage at closing  to approximately 2.6x. Actual gross leverage at March 31, 2014 was 2.5x, with  total debt at $109.8 billion. With the close of the acquisition, Fitch expects  VZ to materially reduce debt over the next few years. EBITDA growth, combined  with debt reductions is expected to reduce leverage to approximately 2x by the  end of 2016. Fitch believes this level is appropriate for an 'A-' rating. --While leverage will be outside an appropriate range for an 'A-' rating for  several years, Fitch believes metrics will return to a level appropriate for the  rating due to VZ's strong position in the wireless industry and the significant  cash flows generated by the wireless business. This is in combination with VZ  management's commitment to delever, as evidenced by the aggressive delevering  following the acquisition of Alltel Corporation in early 2009. Other supporting  factors include the absence of operations-related execution risk. --A key to debt reduction over the next several years will be the continued  generation of strong free cash flow (FCF) at VZW. VZW's simple FCF (EBITDA less  capital spending) in 2013 was approximately $24.8 billion. VZ's consolidated FCF  (after dividends and capital spending but before distributions to Vodafone) was  $16.3 billion in 2013. Owing to the acquisition of the remaining VZW stake,  Fitch estimates VZ's FCF will be at least 50% lower in 2014 as a result of  transaction-related interest costs, higher dividend requirements due to the  shares issued to Vodafone equity holders and higher cash taxes. --The strong competitive position of VZW as evidenced by industry-low churn  rates, high margins and the most developed LTE network in the U.S. support  expectations for VZ's cash flow stability and the longer rating horizon embodied  in the rating. VZ's liquidity is supported by its consolidated cash balances, which were $2.9  billion at March 31, 2014, and by a $6.2 billion credit facility. Fitch expects  VZ to maintain aggregate CP balances within a level fully backed by the  facility. The credit facility has no ratings triggers or other restrictive  covenants, such as leverage or interest coverage tests. In August 2013, the  facility was extended for a year and now matures in August 2017. After the  effect of letters of credit (LOCs), approximately $6.1 billion is available on  the facility. To provide additional liquidity, a $2 billion, 364-day revolving credit facility  became effective in February 2014. This facility has a 3.5x leverage covenant.  On a consolidated basis, VZ and its subsidiaries have scheduled debt maturities  of approximately $0.8 billion and $2.6 billion in 2014 and 2015, respectively. In 2014, Fitch expects consolidated capital spending to range from $16.5 billion  to $17 billion, comparable to or slightly higher than the $16.6 billion spent in  2013. Investment in the wireless network continues to be an area of emphasis due  to the strong demand for 4G LTE capacity for rapidly growing data services. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch believes a positive rating action is unlikely in the foreseeable future,  given the leverage incurred in the Vodafone transaction. Conversely, Fitch may take negative rating action if: --Operating performance causes delevering to take place at a materially slower  than anticipated pace; --A weakening of VZW's competitive position that would jeopardize the stability  of cash flows.

93,"   By Noel Randewich and Liana B. Baker | SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK  SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK Erik Huggers is leaving Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) just five months after joining the company via the acquisition of the Intel Corp (INTC.O) “OnCue” streaming service he developed, signaling the communications giant’s waning interest in providing an Internet-delivered TV service.The former BBC executive, who told Reuters on Friday he is departing the company, had worked on OnCue for Intel for more than two years before Verizon bought it in January to accelerate a push into video services, including TV channels delivered over the Internet, known as an ""over the top"", or OTT, service.While other companies have been talking up their plans to deliver such a service, a source familiar with the matter said that Verizon was now moving away from the OTT strategy and that the departure of Huggers, who was a proponent of an Internet-only service, reflected that.A Verizon spokesman confirmed Huggers' departure and in regards to its strategy said, “We obtained a strong combination of technological and personnel assets from Intel Media. We intend to strategically utilize the OnCue technology and talent going forward to grow our business. That has not changed.""Verizon had previously said OnCue would help it offer video over its Fios fiber-optic infrastructure as well.  Seen by some as a bold attempt to revolutionize TV and others as a distraction from Intel's chip business, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich pulled the plug and put the unit up for sale before it was launched. Intel's retreat from streaming TV was a disappointment to people in Silicon Valley who hoped the technology company could break open a market tightly controlled by a handful of cable and entertainment conglomerates. With the acquisition, Huggers and many of his employees moved over to Verizon, where he hoped to launch the service to consumers. But he told Reuters he advised his staff on Thursday that he was leaving the company.Huggers said in an interview he had worked well with his immediate boss at Verizon, Marni Walden, recently appointed to head product development, as well as Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam. ""There were no conflicts at all. The technology is great, the team is great, the future is secure, the dream lives on. It's time to hand the baby over to someone else,” he said. Verizon's rivals are working on their own Internet TV services. AT&T Inc (T.N), which made an offer to buy DirecTV last week in a $45.5 billion deal, has said it would take 12 to 18 months for the combined companies to come up with an over-the-top service. Dish Network Corp (DISH.O) has said it expects to launch its personalized streaming product by year-end, having already struck a deal for programming from Walt Disney Co (DIS.N).

Owing to the acquisition of the remaining VZW stake,  Fitch estimates VZ's FCF will be at least 50% lower in 2014 as a result of  transaction-related interest costs, higher dividend requirements due to the  shares issued to Vodafone equity holders and higher cash taxes. --The strong competitive position of VZW as evidenced by industry-low churn  rates, high margins and the most developed LTE network in the U.S. support  expectations for VZ's cash flow stability and the longer rating horizon embodied  in the rating. VZ's liquidity is supported by its consolidated cash balances, which were $2.9  billion at March 31, 2014, and by a $6.2 billion credit facility. Fitch expects  VZ to maintain aggregate commercial paper balances within a level fully backed  by the facility. The credit facility has no ratings triggers or other  restrictive covenants, such as leverage or interest coverage tests. In August  2013, the facility was extended for a year and now matures in August 2017. After  the effect of letters of credit (LOCs), approximately $6.1 billion is available  on the facility. To provide additional liquidity, a $2 billion, 364-day revolving credit facility  became effective in February 2014. This facility has a 3.5x leverage covenant.  On a consolidated basis, VZ and its subsidiaries have scheduled debt maturities  of approximately $0.8 billion and $2.6 billion in 2014 and 2015, respectively. In 2014, Fitch expects consolidated capital spending to range from $16.5 billion  to $17 billion, comparable to or slightly higher than the $16.6 billion spent in  2013. Investment in the wireless network continues to be an area of emphasis due  to the strong demand for 4G LTE capacity for rapidly growing data services. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch believes a positive rating action is unlikely in the foreseeable future,  given the leverage incurred in the Vodafone transaction. Conversely, Fitch may take negative rating action if: --Operating performance causes delevering to take place at a materially slower  than anticipated pace; --A weakening of VZW's competitive position that would jeopardize the stability  of cash flows.

The letter is the latest sign of tension between content providers like Netflix and Internet service providers over who should pay the price for companies that stream heavy traffic online.In a cease-and-desist letter sent to Netflix, Verizon also asked the video streaming service to provide information including a list of customers on the Verizon network to whom Netflix delivered the notices, or face legal action.""Failure to provide this information may lead us to pursue legal remedies,"" Verizon general counsel Randal Milch said in a letter to Netflix general counsel David Hyman.In mid-May, Netflix started a test of messages displayed on the screen for some customers when a video is buffering. The messages say that there is congestion on the network of Verizon or another Internet service provider. Netflix said on Thursday the test is continuing and meant to provide customers more information about their service, similar to a speed index that Netflix has published for months with a ranking of Internet service providers. ""This is about consumers not getting what they paid for from their broadband provider,"" Netflix spokesman Jonathan Friedland said. ""We are trying to provide more transparency, just like we do with the ISP Speed Index, and Verizon is trying to shut down that discussion.""David Young, Verizon's vice president of federal regulatory affairs, told Reuters he felt the messages were part of a Netflix agenda to promote its views in Washington. Netflix has been urging the Federal Communications Commission to prevent broadband providers such as Verizon from charging Netflix fees for faster delivery of videos.     ""That seems to be the motivation, to try to make a point or make points in that discussion that is going on in Washington D.C.,” Young said in a phone interview, though he wouldn't specify the issues.     In the letter, Verizon said the message's assertions were deceptive and inaccurate and that the responsibility for slow streaming on the site falls on Netflix. Verizon said that in order to save money, Netflix relies on middlemen to distribute its content knowing that some of them have issues with congestion in some networks.  In April, Netflix said it reluctantly signed a deal to pay fees to Verizon to bypass those middlemen and deliver content directly to the company, ensuring faster speeds. But Verizon is still working to implement the needed architecture and expects to finish improvements by the end of 2014, said Young.

97,"   By Diane Bartz and Alina Selyukh | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Sprint Corp (S.N) and T-Mobile TMUS.N might have some fresh arguments to allay regulator skepticism about a merger, but the government may still be reluctant to approve shrinking the U.S. wireless market from four main players to three.    Analysts said a decline in shares of both companies on Thursday reflected those high regulatory hurdles. T-Mobile closed 2.3 percent lower and Sprint 4 percent lower. Sprint, purchased by Japan's Softbank Corp (9984.T) in 2013, has agreed to pay about $40 per share, or over $32 billion, for T-Mobile US, a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, bringing to a head a long-discussed and controversial deal to reshape the U.S. cellphone market.  But top U.S. antitrust and communications enforcers have already warned that the wireless market is too concentrated. In 2011 the Justice Department stopped a bid by AT&T Inc (T.N), No. 2 in the market, to buy struggling T-Mobile.Top dog Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and AT&T each have roughly twice as many subscribers as either Sprint or T-Mobile, in the third and fourth spots by numbers of subscribers. Bill Baer, the assistant attorney general for antitrust, said in January that it would difficult for his agency to approve a big wireless mergers.""It’s going to be hard for someone to make a persuasive case that reducing four firms to three is actually going to improve competition for the benefit of American consumers,"" Baer told the New York Times.  Masayoshi Son, CEO of Softbank, trekked to Washington in February to seek the counsel of Tom Wheeler, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, but got a cool response to a potential merger. Wheeler has not hinted at any softening of that stance.Antitrust experts called the unusually public cautions from Wheeler and Baer a warning.""This is going to be a tough road for them. Tough,"" said one expert, who spoke anonymously to protect business relationships. ""In the wake of AT&T/T-Mobile, this deal faces long odds."" The Justice Department noted T-Mobile's role as a maverick and price-cutter as a reason to stop the earlier deal. That dynamic has not changed, said David Balto, a veteran of the Federal Trade Commission now in private practice. ""There's a segment of the market which needs to have competition protected, which is the value (discount) segment,"" Balto said. ""This is where these guys go head to head.""    A third antitrust expert said the companies might have cards yet to play to win approval: ""There may be good arguments (for the deal) that we just haven't seen yet. But ... the odds are heavily against the deal.""SoftBank is likely to argue that the huge pending mergers of Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) with Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N and AT&T with DirecTV DTV.O reinforce the danger of creating a handful of media and telecom giants. That threat was underlined when the FCC in May voted to restrict AT&T and Verizon in the 2015 auction of highly valued low-frequency airwaves. But others say approval this year of a merger between US Airways and American Airlines was a sign regulators could be convinced of the merits of a deal that reduces the number of competitors but creates a stronger number three. ""They need a game-changing idea,"" said Robert McDowell, a former Republican FCC commissioner. ""There has to be a new proposal in order to shake up the mindset of the Obama administration which has a 'religious' conviction against going from four to three national wireless carriers. I don’t see that proposal yet, but perhaps they’re working on it.""

Consumers have complained to the Federal Communications Commission about the ongoing spat between Netflix and Internet service providers (ISPs).

Netflix has urged the agency to begin regulating such agreements to do away with fees that content companies pay.Though the FCC has not indicated that it plans to regulate the deals, the agency is now asking multiple Internet service providers and content companies, particularly video service providers, to provide details, Wheeler said.""Consumers need to understand what is occurring when the Internet service they’ve paid for does not adequately deliver the content they desire, especially content they’ve also paid for,"" he told reporters after a monthly FCC meeting.""What we are doing right now is collecting information, not regulating.

Barclays and Wells Fargo could not be reached by press time.The refinancing aims to increase an existing revolver to $8 billion from $6.2 billion, extend the maturity date from August 12, 2017, to July 31, 2018, and lower pricing. The new revolver also replaces an existing $2 billion, 364-day revolving credit. The $8 billion, four-year revolver will pay 10bp undrawn for current ratings of Baa1/BBB+. If drawn, the revolver pays 162.5bp.In addition, the company is seeking to amend its existing $3.3 billion, five-year term loan. Pricing on the term loan opens at LIB+125. In September 2013, Verizon announced its plans to acquire the 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless that it did not already own from Vodafone. The acquisition was backed with a $61 billion bridge loan led by JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, BAML and Barclays. JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley were global coordinators of the financing.The $61 billion bridge loan was replaced with $49 billion of bonds and $12 billion in three- and five-year term loans. Separately, the financing included a $2 billon, 364-day revolver.Pricing on the $6 billion, three-year term loan and $6 billion, five-year term loan is LIB+137.5 and LIB+150, respectively.

118,"   By Marina Lopes  Verizon Communications Inc, the largest U.S. wireless telecommunications company, on Tuesday reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue on a jump in wireless customers and a surge in tablet sales.The increase in customers is a boost for Verizon, which has been reluctant to follow rivals like T-Mobile US Inc which have discounted aggressively. Profit in the second quarter also topped Wall Street estimates.Net additions of wireless subscribers with contracts surged 53 percent to 1.4 million in the second quarter ended June 30. That included a record 1.15 million in tablet sales. Wireless companies have been weaning customers from plans that subsidize equipment financing over two years, and offering plans that separate service charges from equipment purchases.Verizon has not been aggressively promoting such plans, and said only 18 percent of wireless customers signed up for them. ""We want our customers to have choice. We did not abandon the legacy model when we launched our installment plan as other carriers have,"" said Fran Shammo, Verizon's chief financial officer. Two-year pricing plans have long served as a natural buffer against customer switching, according to Craig Moffett, chief analyst at MoffettNathanson.""Verizon has maintained all along that the industry shouldn't be so quick to abandon a strategy that has served it awfully well for last decade,"" said Moffett.“The risk is that the other carriers will continue to test lower and lower prices until the market finds a new equilibrium and that Verizon will be increasingly isolated at the high end of the market,” he added.The company has focused on retaining customers who bring more monthly revenue and switching them to products such as smartphones and tablets that generate more profit. Despite its premium prices, the company has been able to reduce customer defections, with an average rate of 1.25 percent compared with 1.37 percent last quarter.  Verizon's wireline revenue rose for the first time in seven years due to increased adoption of its FiOS internet and television products, as well as the migration of customers from older copper lines, to better performing fiber. The company said it added 100,000 FiOS video customers and 139,000 net new FiOS Internet connections in the quarter. Verizon shares edged up 0.3 percent at $50.85.

121,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 24 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating to Verizon  Communications Inc.'s (NYSE: VZ) proposed senior unsecured exchange notes due  2020, 2046 and 2054. VZ commenced an offer to exchange up to $12 billion of  existing senior unsecured notes that it (or its subsidiaries) had previously  issued for the new VZ notes. Fitch's current Issuer Default Rating for VZ is  'A-' with a Stable Rating Outlook. KEY RATING DRIVERS --The February 2014 acquisition of the remaining Verizon Wireless (VZW) stake  pressures VZ's near-term credit metrics, pushing pro forma leverage at closing  to approximately 2.6x. Actual gross leverage at June 30, 2014 was 2.5x, with  total debt at $110 billion. With the close of the acquisition, Fitch expects VZ  to materially reduce debt over the next few years. EBITDA growth, combined with  debt reductions is expected to reduce leverage to approximately 2x by the end of  2016. Fitch believes this level is appropriate for an 'A-' rating. --While leverage will be outside an appropriate range for an 'A-' rating for  several years, Fitch believes metrics will return to a level appropriate for the  rating due to VZ's strong position in the wireless industry and the significant  cash flows generated by the wireless business. This is in combination with VZ  management's commitment to delever, as evidenced by the aggressive delevering  following the acquisition of Alltel Corporation in early 2009. Other supporting  factors include the absence of operations-related execution risk. --A key to debt reduction over the next several years will be the continued  generation of strong free cash flow (FCF) at VZW. VZW's simple FCF (EBITDA less  capital spending) for the LTM ending June 30, 2014 was approximately $25.3  billion. Owing to the acquisition of the remaining VZW stake, Fitch estimates  VZ's FCF (after dividends and capital spending) will be in the $3 billion to $5  billion range in 2014 as a result of transaction-related interest costs, higher  dividend requirements due to the shares issued to Vodafone equity holders and  higher cash taxes. --The strong competitive position of VZW as evidenced by industry-low churn  rates, high margins and the most developed LTE network in the U.S. support  expectations for VZ's cash flow stability and the longer rating horizon embodied  in the rating. VZ's liquidity is supported by its consolidated cash balances, which were $5.8  billion at June 30, 2014, and by a $6.2 billion credit facility. Fitch expects  VZ to maintain aggregate CP balances within a level fully backed by the  facility. The credit facility has no ratings triggers or other restrictive  covenants, such as leverage or interest coverage tests. In August 2013, the  facility was extended for a year and now matures in August 2017. After the  effect of letters of credit (LOCs), approximately $6.1 billion is available on  the facility. To provide additional liquidity, a $2 billion, 364-day revolving credit facility  became effective in February 2014. This facility has a 3.5x leverage covenant.  On a consolidated basis, VZ and its subsidiaries have scheduled debt maturities  of approximately $0.8 billion and $2.6 billion in 2014 and 2015, respectively. In 2014, Fitch expects consolidated capital spending to range from $16.5 billion  to $17 billion, comparable to or slightly higher than the $16.6 billion spent in  2013. Investment in the wireless network continues to be an area of emphasis due  to the strong demand for 4G LTE capacity for rapidly growing data services. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch believes a positive rating action is unlikely in the foreseeable future,  given the leverage incurred in the Vodafone transaction. Conversely, Fitch may take negative rating action if: --Operating performance causes delevering to take place at a materially slower  than anticipated pace; --A weakening of VZW's competitive position that would jeopardize the stability  of cash flows.

124,"   By Alina Selyukh | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The top U.S. telecommunications regulator said on Wednesday he is ""deeply troubled"" by Verizon Communications Inc's plan to slow data downloads for some high-speed wireless customers remaining on the older unlimited data plans.Verizon, the largest U.S. wireless carrier, stopped offering unlimited data plans in 2012 and last week said it will begin slowing services for the top 5 percent of data users who are on such data plans in places where the network is experiencing high demand. The policy is already in effect for unlimited subscribers on the 3G network but would now be expanded to the higher-speed 4G network. But Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler raised concerns about the plan on Wednesday.""I am deeply troubled by your July 25, 2014 announcement that Verizon Wireless intends to slow down some customers' data speeds on your 4G LTE network starting in October 2014,"" Wheeler wrote in a letter to Verizon Wireless President and CEO Daniel Mead released by the FCC. ""It is disturbing to me that Verizon Wireless would base its 'network management' on distinctions among its customers' data plans, rather than on network architecture or technology. ... I know of no past Commission statement that would treat as 'reasonable network management' a decision to slow traffic to a user who has paid, after all, for 'unlimited' service.""A Verizon Wireless spokesman said the company's officials will officially respond to Wheeler's letter once they have received and reviewed it. ""What we announced last week was a highly targeted and very limited network optimization effort, only targeting cell sites experiencing high demand,"" the spokesman said. ""The purpose is to ensure there is capacity for everyone in those limited circumstances, and that high users don't limit capacity for others.""Although No. 3 and No. 4 carriers Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US Inc continue to offer some versions of unlimited data plans to new subscribers, U.S. wireless carriers have been working to shift their increasingly data-hungry subscribers onto tiered pricing plans, which charge customers for specific amounts of data they agree to consume.For Wheeler, the letter represented another push against an Internet service provider (ISP) as he seeks to establish himself as a strong defender of web users' interests who would punish ISPs whose business practices may hurt consumers or competition.  His efforts follow the FCC's controversial proposal of new ""net neutrality"" rules that guide how broadband providers manage web traffic on their networks, which has drawn fire from consumer advocates, the public and some Internet companies.In Wednesday's letter, Wheeler also posed to Mead several questions about the plan, including the rationale to treat consumers differently depending on their data plans, the reasons behind extending speed reduction from the slower-speed 3G network to the more efficient high-speed 4G LTE network, and how Verizon would justify the plan under its current regulatory obligations, including those meant to protect ""net neutrality.""

""The type of network optimization policy that we follow has been endorsed by the FCC as a narrowly targeted way to ensure a fair allocation of capacity during times of congestion,"" Kathleen Grillo, senior vice president of federal regulatory affairs at Verizon, said in the letter.""In short this practice has been widely accepted with little or no controversy,"" Grillo added in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters. Verizon, the largest U.S. wireless carrier, noted that the practice of slowing down certain users' networks in order to prevent congestion has been widely used by broadband providers and its competitors.""We absolutely know that it was the right thing to do and we know that it was in line with the FCC's principles,"" Mead said on Monday, in a meeting with a group of journalists.

128,"  (Adds details of inquiry, comments)By Alina SelyukhWASHINGTON Aug 5 The U.S. Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday proposed changing how it measures high-speed Internet to potentially require download speeds of 10 megabits per second (Mbps) or higher for a service to qualify as broadband.The FCC currently defines broadband, or high-speed Internet, as 4 Mbps download speed and 1 Mbps upload speed. The agency will seek public comment on whether those bandwidth thresholds should be increased and whether different ones should be set for wired and wireless connections.In a ""notice of inquiry"" released on Tuesday, the FCC asked whether download speeds of 10 Mbps or higher should qualify as broadband and whether the minimum upload speed rate should also be higher to adequately address consumers' needs.""As more people adopt faster broadband speeds, we are asking if all consumers, even in the most rural regions, should have greater access to better broadband,"" FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said in a statement. U.S. consumers are increasingly using the Internet to stream music and videos, make calls or use other services that continue to demand faster speeds. For instance, Netflix recommends a 5 Mbps Internet connection speed to stream video in high definition.The FCC's recent assessments suggested a 10 Mbps download bandwidth benchmark could satisfy moderate but not high Internet use by a household of three.U.S. telecommunications law gives the FCC the authority to regulate Internet service providers (ISPs) such as Verizon Communications Inc, Comcast Corp and AT&T Inc as it oversees the roll-out of broadband services to all Americans ""in a reasonable and timely fashion."" A higher speed threshold for broadband, could influence the U.S. government's perspective on competition among ISPs.The FCC's recent reviews have found a notable portion of the U.S. population, particularly in rural areas, lacks access to high-speed Internet. If adopted, a stricter broadband definition could mean an even smaller part of the U.S. population would be deemed as having access to broadband and could reduce the areas of the country where the FCC considers high-speed Internet to be available.In Tuesday's notice, the FCC asks when it may consider mobile services as a ""functional equivalent"" for fixed broadband and how it should address broadband availability in areas where multiple ISPs operate but no service meets the broadband benchmark on its own.It also seeks comment on whether the FCC should measure speeds during hours of regular or peak use, how or whether it should consider the impact of data caps, and various other factors it could weigh.In its latest report on progress in broadband deployment, in 2012, the FCC found 6 percent of Americans lacked access to fixed broadband service. In rural areas, that group comprised one-fourth of the population.The FCC now will collect comments on a potential change of broadband definition for 45 days as it prepares a new Broadband Progress Report, an FCC official said.

130,"  (Adds Ergen comments on spectrum, analyst comment; updates shares)By Liana B. Baker and Lisa RichwineNEW YORK/LOS ANGELES Aug 6 Dish Network Corp  Chairman Charlie Ergen said it makes sense for the satellite operator to consider making a bid for T-Mobile US Inc  now that Sprint is out of the picture.""Certainly to the extent that Sprint either dropped out or wasn't interested or the government wouldn't allow it ... then T-Mobile is something that we would have an interest in,"" Ergen said on Wednesday on a conference call after Dish reported quarterly results.Investors have been watching for any signs of what Ergen plans to do with the spectrum the company has spent billions stockpiling over the past few years.Possible plans include a partnership with another wireless player or building or buying a wireless network. While the company's core pay TV business has stalled, Dish shares have risen more than 40 percent to $63.81 over the past 12 months mainly on investors' high hopes for the value of the company's spectrum. Late Tuesday, Sprint Corp dropped its planned bid to acquire T-Mobile U.S. Inc, the No. 4 U.S. carrier, after regulatory hurdles proved too steep, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.Ergen said he was not surprised that Sprint walked away from T-Mobile and called it a ""smart move,"" considering the public resistance from regulators.""Sometimes the best deals you do are the ones you walk away from, and it takes a lot of guts to do it,"" he said. Ergen said Sprint's abandoned plans for T-Mobile likely increase the options for his company, but executives have not yet discussed their plans. Still, the ""announcement last night probably increased some optionality,"" he said.Dish may face some competition to win T-Mobile from French telecom company Iliad, which threw its hat into the ring with a $15 billion offer last week, T-Mobile's parent company, Deutsche Telekom, has shown no interest in engaging with Iliad so far.Many investors have believed that Verizon Communications Inc  would step in and buy all of Dish or all of its spectrum, said Craig Moffett, senior analyst at MoffettNathanson. ""Now, investors will have to get comfortable with a wider array of possible outcomes,"" he wrote in a research note.Ergen reiterated that it was possible Dish would sell its spectrum but that was not his preferred option.""Unless we can build a business that's more valuable than the core value, we're a seller,"" he said. ""But if we can build a business long term that's actually more valuable than the core value, then we're going to go do that.""""We're long-term players,"" he added. ""If you want somebody to flip some spectrum, make a quick buck, go buy somebody else.""Dish shares rose 1.6 percent, or 99 cents, to $63.14 in late-afternoon trading on Nasdaq.

136,"  * Mobile is weak link in Sony's struggling electronics division* New Xperia to be launched in Japan for winter holiday season* Sprint looking to bolster handset line-up to keep subscribers* Sharp Corp developed smartphone exclusively for SoftBank/Sprint   (Adds details on Sprint pricing strategy, Sony carrier relations)By Yoshiyasu Shida and Reiji MuraiTOKYO, Aug 29 Japan's SoftBank Corp and its U.S. mobile carrier Sprint Corp will offer a Sony  smartphone for the first time, sources with knowledge of the matter said, as the two technology titans confront daunting challenges in the U.S. market.The deal could give a much-needed boost to Sony's struggling mobile division, which last month said it no longer expected to make a profit in the year to next March. It will also bolster Sprint's handset line-up as it seeks to stem a flight in subscribers.SoftBank, Japan's second most valuable company, is pushing price cuts and promotions at Sprint while unveiling joint smartphone offerings to shore up the No. 3 U.S. carrier, after U.S. regulators thwarted its hopes for a merger to give it the scale to take on bigger rivals. Sony, long one of Japan's best-known brands but now struggling to pull its flagship electronics division out of the red, has been unable to gain traction in the key U.S. smartphone market, depressing a mobile unit that it hopes to make a pillar of its revival.Sony managed only a 2.1 percent share of the global smartphone market in 2013, according to market research firm Gartner, and now faces rising competition from low-cost Chinese smartphones. In the U.S. market, the only carrier offering its handsets is No. 4 T-Mobile US Inc.Sony will sell a soon-to-be launched Xperia flagship phone in the United States via Sprint, four sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. In Japan, SoftBank will make the phone available in time for the winter holiday season, they added.Sony and SoftBank declined to comment. SON AND SONY Sony is expected to unveil its next flagship smartphone, the Xperia Z3, at next week's IFA tech expo in Berlin. But the company remains far behind the big names in the industry: Apple Inc, which is set to unveil its new iPhone 6 next month, and Samsung Electronics Co, which makes the Galaxy series.""I can't see this making much of a difference,"" said Deutsche Bank analyst Yasuo Nakane of the Sprint deal, stressing the importance of a deal with a major carrier such as Verizon Communications Inc - along with AT&T Inc one of the top two U.S. carriers - to get critical mass in that market. Sony offers an Xperia tablet through Verizon.""Even if they put out a phone on Sprint, Verizon is the priority any way you think about it,"" Nakane said.Masahiro Ono, an analyst at Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities, nevertheless saw the deal as a move in the right direction.""They haven't been able to maintain very good relationships with carriers, unlike Samsung who has done very well,"" he said.Sprint's aggressive strategy on new handsets and price cuts, with the unveiling last week of a smartphone developed by Sharp Corp exclusive for Sprint and SoftBank, is likely to accelerate under new chief executive Marcelo Claure, plucked from handset reseller Brightstar Corp which SoftBank acquired last year.SoftBank CEO and founder Masayoshi Son has vowed bold moves by Sprint since a proposal to merge with T-Mobile US was withdrawn early this month.

137,"  WASHINGTON Verizon Communications Inc will pay $7.4 million to settle a U.S. investigation that found the company failed to notify properly some customers of their privacy rights before using their information for marketing, U.S. regulators said on Wednesday.The Federal Communications Commission said its investigation found that starting in 2006, some 2 million new Verizon phone customers did not receive proper privacy notices in their first  bill. The notices would have told consumers how to opt out of having their personal information used to tailor marketing offers, which the company later sent to some of them. Phone companies are generally prohibited from using personal data they collect from their customers, though such data can be used for marketing if the consumer gives permission.

140,"   By Alina Selyukh | WASHINGTON, Sept 5  WASHINGTON, Sept 5 Sprint Corp said on Friday it was adding 15 new rural and regional wireless providers to its U.S. roaming program, a move bolstering the company's efforts to cheaply expand its footprint as it fights to stay competitive as a national carrier.The program allows Sprint and its smaller partners to use each other's networks for roaming at a mutually attractive price. A total of 27 carriers, covering 565,000 square miles and a population area of more than 38 million people, have now entered into roaming agreements with Sprint.The 27 partnerships could save Sprint about $1.9 billion in expenditures on new cell phone towers and other infrastructure that would be necessary to bring 4G coverage to new areas on its own, based on calculations provided by a source familiar with the program estimates.With those savings, deals with rural carriers could offer Sprint a lifeline to improve its national presence following the collapse of the merger with T-Mobile US Inc. Like T-Mobile's, Sprint's network has been largely concentrated around metropolitan areas while the coverage by the two biggest U.S. carriers, Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc, stretches nationwide.Growing its footprint is one of Sprint's major challenges as the company struggles to win back millions of customers it lost during its messy network overhaul in recent years. The task is particularly tough in a nearly saturated market and with No. 4 T-Mobile pushing to leapfrog Sprint as the No. 3 U.S. carrier.In March, Sprint Chairman Masayoshi Son struck an agreement with the Competitive Carriers Association, which represents many U.S. rural and regional carriers, providing the framework for a rural roaming program. In June, Sprint announced the first 12 individual carriers to launch the rural roaming program into reality, including Virginia-based nTelos Wireless and Mississippi-based C Spire Wireless.The 15 new partners announced Friday include Kentucky-based Bluegrass Cellular, Idaho-based Syringa Wireless and Alabama-based Pine Belt Wireless. Perhaps because Sprint needs rural coverage more than its rivals, its 4G roaming agreements offer the carriers more perks and more flexibility than they have seen from other companies.Verizon's program, for instance, largely limits partners to building networks that rely on airwaves owned by Verizon, while Sprint's allows them to use their own spectrum. Sprint's partners also say it offers more attractive roaming rates.Another major perk Sprint offers is access to devices at cheaper prices negotiated with handset distributors, solving a major problem for smaller carriers who are often stuck paying top dollar for devices because they lack their competitors' scale.(Reporting by Alina Selyukh; Editing by Tom Brown)",2014-09-05,VZ,"Fri Sep 5, 2014 | 1:19pm EDT","Sprint expands rural roaming program, adding 15 new carriers",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-sprint-corp-rural-idUSL1N0R615L20140905?type=companyNews
141,"   By Marina Lopes | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Verizon Communications will give subscribers who trade in an old iPhone a free iPhone 6 in exchange for a two-year contract, the country's largest wireless carrier announced hours after Apple Inc unveiled the widely anticipated device.The announcement came as critics speculated that Apple's newest phone, starting at $199 with a two-year contract, would not be competitive as more carriers eliminate contracts and unbundle service charges from the cost of devices. Analysts say that by making the cost of devices more transparent, equipment financing plans make expensive handsets like the iPhone less appealing. On the other hand, the plans allow customers to pay for devices in installments, making pricy devices like the iPhone more accessible.Customers who trade in an iPhone 4, 4s, 5, 5c or 5s in working condition will receive a $200 gift card to pre-order the 16-gigabyte version of the newer model, Verizon said in a statement. The offer does not apply to Apple's other new phone, the larger iPhone 6 Plus. Verizon has been more reluctant than competitors to dive into equipment financing, and its promotion indicates its attachment to the older contract model, which binds subscribers to the carrier for a fixed term, said Jan Dawson, analyst at JackDaw Research. ""There is an inherent risk in the shift to installment billing that it creates more loyalty to the device than to the carrier,"" said Dawson. ""Verizon sees the value of the two-year contract in that tying a device to a two-year plan can prevent churn,"" said Dawson. He pointed out that new device releases are major factors for subscribers in deciding whether to switch carriers. As the market for new smartphone customers shrinks, carriers have been competing aggressively for subscribers, slashing prices and engaging in creative promotions to poach each others' customers.

143,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, September 10 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Verizon Communications  Inc.'s (NYSE: VZ) Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) and debt ratings as follows: --Long-term IDR at 'A-'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A-'; --Senior unsecured bank facility at 'A-'; --Senior unsecured term loan due 2019 at 'A-'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial paper (CP) at 'F2'. Fitch has also assigned an 'A-' rating to Verizon's USD$870 million senior  unsecured 4.8% notes due 2044 issued in Taiwan. The Rating Outlook is Stable. In addition, Fitch has reviewed and affirmed the ratings of certain VZ  subsidiaries. A detailed list of the affirmations follows at the end of this  release. KEY RATING DRIVERS --The February 2014 acquisition of the remaining Verizon Wireless (VZW) stake  pressured VZ's near-term credit metrics, pushing pro forma leverage at closing  to approximately 2.6x. Actual gross leverage at June 30, 2014 was 2.5x, with  total debt at $110 billion. With the close of the acquisition, Fitch expects VZ  to materially reduce debt over the next few years. EBITDA growth, combined with  debt reductions, is expected to reduce leverage to around 2x by the end of 2016,  a level more appropriate for an 'A-' rating. The precise timing of the reduction  in leverage is subject to some uncertainty, given the potential for spending in  upcoming auctions for wireless spectrum, a portion of which Fitch expects to be  initially debt funded.  --Fitch believes metrics will return to a level appropriate for the rating in  the 2016/2017 timeframe due to VZ's strong position in the wireless industry and  the significant cash flows generated by the wireless business. This is in  combination with VZ management's commitment to delever, as evidenced by the  aggressive delevering following the acquisition of Alltel Corporation in early  2009.  --A key to debt reduction over the next several years will be the continued  generation of strong free cash flow (FCF) at VZW. VZW's simple FCF (EBITDA less  capital spending) for the LTM ending June 30, 2014 was approximately $25.3  billion. Owing to the acquisition of the remaining VZW stake, Fitch estimates  VZ's FCF (after dividends and capital spending) will be in the $4 billion to $6  billion range in 2014 as a result of transaction-related interest costs, higher  dividend requirements due to the shares issued to Vodafone equity holders and  higher cash taxes. --VZW's strong competitive position, evidenced by industry-low churn rates on  average, high margins, and the most developed LTE network in the U.S. support  Fitch's expectations that VZ will maintain cash flow stability and support the  longer rating horizon for leverage metrics to return to levels consistent with  the rating. VZ's liquidity is supported by its reported consolidated cash balances, which  were $5.8 billion at June 30, 2014, and by its revolving credit facility. As of  June 30, 2014, the company had a $6.2 billion revolving credit facility due in  August 2017, as well as a $2 billion, 364-day revolving credit facility maturing  in February 2015. In July, Verizon amended its revolving credit facility to  increase the size to $8 billion from $6.2 billion and extended the maturity to  July 2018 from August 2017. Fitch expects VZ to maintain aggregate CP balances  within a level fully backed by the facility. The credit facility has no ratings  triggers or other restrictive covenants, such as leverage or interest coverage  tests.  On a consolidated basis, VZ and its subsidiaries have scheduled debt maturities  of approximately $0.8 billion and $2.6 billion in 2014 and 2015, respectively. In 2014, Fitch expects consolidated capital spending to range from $16.5 billion  to $17 billion, comparable to or slightly higher than the $16.6 billion spent in  2013. Investment in the wireless network continues to be an area of emphasis due  to the strong demand for 4G LTE capacity for rapidly growing data services. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch believes a positive rating action is unlikely in the foreseeable future,  given the leverage incurred in the Vodafone transaction. Conversely, Fitch may take negative rating action if operating performance  causes deleveraging to take place at a materially slower than anticipated pace,  either alone or in combination with spending on spectrum through 2016. Fitch  estimates even with some moderation in revenue growth and margin pressure that  Verizon could spend up to $15 billion on spectrum before pressuring the rating.  Discretionary management moves that cause leverage to rise above 2.5x, such as  another material acquisition or stock repurchases, could lead to a negative  action in the absence of a strong commitment to delever. Fitch has affirmed ratings of the following Verizon entities with a Stable  Outlook: Cellco Partnership --IDR at 'A-'; --Senior unsecured debt (co-issued with Verizon Wireless Capital LLC) at 'A-'. Verizon Wireless Capital LLC --Senior unsecured debt (co-issued with Cellco Partnership) at 'A-'. Alltel Corp. GTE Corp. Verizon Delaware Verizon California Verizon Florida Verizon Maryland Verizon New England Verizon New Jersey Verizon New York Verizon Pennsylvania Verizon Virginia --IDR 'A-'; --Senior unsecured at 'A-'. GTE Southwest --IDR 'A-'; --First mortgage bonds at 'A-'. Verizon Global Funding (merged into Verizon in 2006) --Senior unsecured at 'A-'. The following rating is withdrawn as the debt has been repaid: Verizon Communications Inc. --Senior unsecured term loan due 2017 'A-'. Fitch also affirms and withdraws the 'A-' IDR assigned to Verizon Wireless  Capital LLC due to a change in policy to no longer assign IDRs to  special-purpose financing entities that have no material assets, operational  function or revenues. Fitch will continue to rate debt issues at these  special-purpose financing entities, but in relationship to the parent company  IDR. Contact: Primary Analyst John C.

145,"   By Sam Adams and Christian Plumb | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) plans to launch an Internet-based television service in the first half of next year, its chief executive said on Thursday, in a move intended to shake up traditional cable and satellite TV services.In January, Verizon bought an Intel Corp (INTC.O) venture to create a web-based TV service. The move raised expectations that a viable alternative to cable TV service could finally become a reality. Competition to create such a service has been intensifying lately, with Sony Corp (6758.T), Dish Network Corp (DISH.O) and DirecTV DTV.O developing similar products.""We are very focused on probably late first half of 2015 having products like this in the marketplace,"" McAdam said at an industry conference in New York.Intel and others have struggled to lure content from media companies who prefer to sell bundles of channels to cable and satellite companies. But McAdam expressed optimism that broadcast and cable TV networks will agree to provide programming for such an ""over-the-top"" service.""It's moved from a stiff-arm to more of an embrace,"" he said, adding that the with regard to the big four TV networks and other content providers, ""over the last six months to a year, that dialog is changing dramatically.""On Wednesday, Sony announced that it had secured the rights to carry 22 Viacom channels, including Comedy Central and MTV, for its own cloud-based television service. In another sign parts of the industry are warming to Internet TV, Time Warner Inc and CBS Corp said on Wednesday they were increasingly open to one day making HBO and Showtime available directly to consumers over the Internet.An increased willingness by media companies to make programming available for Web-TV services could squeeze cable TV providers by tempting subscribers to abandon them for cheaper or more flexible options. Separately, McAdam also said Verizon would be open to selling some of its towers if the price was right. ""Those deals are coming to us a little more now, and if an opportunity presented itself to increase shareholder value"" Verizon would be interested in pursuing it, McAdam said at a Goldman Sachs media conference.The company had received preliminary offers at inadequate valuations two years ago, McAdam said.Coinciding with McAdam's comments, Verizon said in a statement that net postpaid subscriber additions in its wireless business grew more than 40 percent in the current quarter due to strong adoption of 4G smartphones and tablets.  The company reported 927,000 net additions in the same period a year earlier.In July, Verizon said demand for FiOS Internet and television services had helped fuel its first gain in wireline revenue in seven years. The migration of customers from older copper lines to better performing fiber was another plus. Verizon's shares were up marginally at $48.93 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

146,"  NEW YORK, Sept 11 Sprint Corp is seeking partners to expand its scale in the wireless market after the collapse of its long sought-after takeover of T-Mobile US Inc , Chief Executive Officer Marcelo Claure said on Thursday.""We are wide open to having discussions with cable companies, over the top companies, other wireless carriers,"" Claure said at a conference sponsored by Goldman Sachs.Such partnerships would allow Sprint to expand its reach and benefit from economies of scale, he said.Since being named Sprint CEO a month ago, Claure has underscored the importance of expanding coverage while cutting costs. Partnerships and acquisitions are a potential avenue to this goal even after Sprint and its parent company, SoftBank Corp , gave up pursuit of T-Mobile.

147,"  (Releads with comments on web TV product)By Sam Adams and Christian PlumbNEW YORK, Sept 11 Verizon Communications Inc  plans to launch an Internet-based television service in the first half of next year, its chief executive said on Thursday, in a move intended to shake up traditional cable and satellite TV services.In January, Verizon bought an Intel Corp venture to create a web-based TV service. The move raised expectations that a viable alternative to cable TV service could finally become a reality. Competition to create such a service has been intensifying lately, with Sony Corp, Dish Network Corp  and DirecTV developing similar products.""We are very focused on probably late first half of 2015 having products like this in the marketplace,"" McAdam said at an industry conference in New York.Intel and others have struggled to lure content from media companies who prefer to sell bundles of channels to cable and satellite companies. But McAdam expressed optimism that broadcast and cable TV networks will agree to provide programming for such an ""over-the-top"" service. ""It's moved from a stiff-arm to more of an embrace,"" he said, adding that the with regard to the big four TV networks and other content providers, ""over the last six months to a year, that dialog is changing dramatically.""On Wednesday, Sony announced that it had secured the rights to carry 22 Viacom channels, including Comedy Central and MTV, for its own cloud-based television service.In another sign parts of the industry are warming to Internet TV, Time Warner Inc and CBS Corp said on Wednesday they were increasingly open to one day making HBO and Showtime available directly to consumers over the Internet. An increased willingness by media companies to make programming available for Web-TV services could squeeze cable TV providers by tempting subscribers to abandon them for cheaper or more flexible options.Separately, McAdam also said Verizon would be open to selling some of its towers if the price was right.""Those deals are coming to us a little more now, and if an opportunity presented itself to increase shareholder value"" Verizon would be interested in pursuing it, McAdam said at a Goldman Sachs media conference. The company had received preliminary offers at inadequate valuations two years ago, McAdam said.Coinciding with McAdam's comments, Verizon said in a statement that net postpaid subscriber additions in its wireless business grew more than 40 percent in the current quarter due to strong adoption of 4G smartphones and tablets.The company reported 927,000 net additions in the same period a year earlier.In July, Verizon said demand for FiOS Internet and television services had helped fuel its first gain in wireline revenue in seven years. The migration of customers from older copper lines to better performing fiber was another plus.Verizon's shares were up marginally at $48.93 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

""We expect continued softness in the fourth quarter as we are again seeing new product deployment delays,"" Chief Financial Officer David Lyle said in a statement on Tuesday.Entropic supplies chips for set-top boxes for cable and satellite TV providers such as Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc. ""The timing of the announcement is a little discouraging,"" BWS Financial analyst Hamed Khorsand said.""The company has been going through a transition for several quarters and management has been continuously suggesting (fourth quarter) would be the turnaround point."" Entropic, which reported declining revenues in seven of its previous eight quarters, lowered its revenue forecast for the quarter ending Sept. 30 to $43 million, from its earlier outlook of between $49 million and $51 million.Also, the company said it now expects an adjusted loss of 15 cents per share for the third quarter, worse than its earlier loss forecast of 11 cents per share.Entropic said it had engaged Barclays to help explore strategic options and that it had not set a timetable for completion of the process.The company set in motion a restructuring plan in June, saying it would close and consolidate several offices globally, impacting 23 percent of its workforce and helping it save $24 million annually.

151,"  WASHINGTON Verizon Communications Inc is open to divesting its network's assets including its cell towers, the company's chief financial officer said on Wednesday.  Verizon, which in February completed a $130 billion deal to buy Vodafone's stake in Verizon Wireless and get full ownership over the company, has previously announced plans to trim some aspects of its portfolio. CFO Fran Shammo said the company was inspired by rival AT&T's $4.85 billion sale of some of its towers to tower operator Crown Castle last year, a deal which preserved AT&T's right to lease and operate the towers for about 28 years.""The AT&T deal was a good deal for them. It opened our eyes and we said 'OK, maybe there is a way to get through this and protect our interest and get a deal that is palatable to us',"" Shammo told investors at a conference in Los Angeles, adding that Verizon wants to protect its ability to expand its network when necessary.  Shammo also said the company's multicast technology, which allows mass audiences to stream content from multiple devices without crowding Verizon's network, will be available in most devices the company launches in the fourth quarter. Verizon is negotiating deals with content providers to create a web-based TV service delivered to mobile platforms outside of a linear TV subscription. However, Shammo predicts it will be a few years before the multicast technology translates into greater leverage for negotiations with content providers. ""It will take a year or two before we have a meaningful number of subscribers where content providers say 'I can get my hands around this, you now have a meaningful base of subscribers', he said.  The company will also have better leverage once Nielsen Holdings, which measures television audiences, is able to measure mobile audiences, he said.

Simply put, the type of network Verizon uses isn't global.The $1.7 trillion wireless industry has just about reached capacity for growth, and mobile companies are turning to connected devices for future revenue. Connected cars, which hook up with a wireless network, currently allow you to do everything from turning an auto into a Wifi link for other devices, to honking its horn from anywhere in the world. The cars are also able to update software remotely.The market for such technology is just getting ramped up. It produced revenue of $8 billion in 2013 and is expected to bring in $20 billion annually by 2018, according to Juniper Research.So far, AT&T has announced deals with brands at eight automakers and Verizon is trailing with four announced deals. Sprint has announced two and T-Mobile has announced one. The value of such deals have not been disclosed.Verizon, for its part, rejects the notion that it is falling behind. It says it is offering more robust services to consumers and auto makers than its rivals. GLOBAL ADVANTAGE But AT&T appears to have the edge because its network uses specifications that have become a global standard, analysts and consultants said. Verizon's network specs are only used in a handful of countries.While that hasn't stopped Verizon from becoming the United States' most popular carrier, it puts the company at a disadvantage with automakers who want to manufacture cars that work on a common standard worldwide.AT&T has also developed a universal SIM card for cars, tractors and shipments that can be programmed remotely to adapt to networks around the world. Verizon has to install location-specific settings on cars depending on where they are shipped.The global reach of AT&T's network type was a key factor in Audi's decision to sign a deal with AT&T in early September. ""We needed a foreign app that was acceptable in Europe and the U.S.,"" said Brad Stertz, Audi's corporate communications manager. ""That narrowed the choices for us at that point."" Unlike AT&T's 3G network, Verizon's does not allow customers to make a phone call and access the Internet at the same time. So in an emergency, Verizon's connected cars can't diagnose problems with vehicle through its data network and call the customer through the car at the same time.This factor was one of the reasons General Motors Co.  signed a deal with AT&T in February 2013 for a new line of connected cars, after almost 20 years in partnership with Verizon.""We all multi-task every day, so why shouldn't our cars multi-task?"" said Kevin Jackson, a connected customer specialist at General Motors. THE COMEBACK? That's not to say that Verizon cannot catch up. A new wave of technology known as Long-Term Evolution will eventually override the distinction between the two network types. By transforming voice calls into data, the technology will allow Verizon users to place calls and access the internet simultaneously. But analysts said automakers may have to wait until 2020 before the technology can be reliably used. At that point, they add, it may be too little, too late for Verizon.Verizon's president of Telematics, Erik Goldman disagrees. The company, which in 2012 bought Hughes Telematics, a maker of voice and data connectivity systems for cars, is not providing just a wireless connection, he said.The company answers customer help lines for support on vehicles, trains car dealers to know how to properly activate the connection in the cars and helps customers with billing issues.

168,"  (Adds broadcasters' response, November auction, details)By Alina SelyukhWASHINGTON Oct 24 The U.S. Federal Communications Commission expects a major auction of low-frequency airwaves to be pushed back to early 2016 from mid-2015 because of its complexity and a pending court challenge, an FCC official said in a blog post on Friday.The FCC is working on rules for the so-called incentive auction, in which wireless carriers would get the first opportunity since 2008 to purchase airwaves that are considered the ""beach-front property"" of radio spectrum for their reach and strength.The auction is regarded as the FCC's most complex undertaking to date, balancing numerous economic, engineering and political considerations, including the need to woo broadcasters to give up the airwaves in the first place.The delay gives the FCC more time to sway TV station owners to participate and T-Mobile US Inc to argue for bidding restrictions on larger rivals AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc. The National Association of Broadcasters, concerned about the potential impact on TV stations, has petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review elements of the FCC's planned auction process.The court has pushed back the deadline on final briefs in the case until late January 2015.""We are confident we will prevail in court, but given the reality of that schedule, the complexity of designing and implementing the auction, and the need for all auction participants to have certainty well in advance of the auction, we now anticipate accepting applications for the auction in the fall of 2015 and starting the auction in early 2016,"" Gary Epstein, who chairs the FCC's Incentive Auction Task Force, wrote in the blog post. The NAB rejected the notion that its lawsuit was the cause of the delay.""We look forward to a speedy resolution of our legal challenge and a successful auction that preserves access to free and local TV for every American,"" NAB spokesman Dennis Wharton said in a statement.The FCC plans a road show this fall to convince TV station owners to participate in the auction, for example by going off the air or sharing frequencies with another station. Wireless carriers said the auction delay was unfortunate, but they added that they welcomed the effort to get it right.Although all large carriers are expected to participate, AT&T so far has been the only one to pledge a specific amount, at least $9 billion.BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk, in a note, said the delay could ""re-open the door for T-Mobile and Sprint to argue for more favorable bidding conditions, particularly given that they have abandoned their merger discussions.""Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile and satellite provider Dish Network Corp also plan to bid in the FCC's AWS-3 auction, which is scheduled for Nov. 3.The anticipated start of the incentive auction was pushed back once before, to mid-2015 from 2014, because of its complexity.

Carriers currently transmit most voice calls on older 2G networks, while data is sent through high-speed 4G networks.""Interoperability among all VoLTE providers takes connectivity to the next level with HD quality voice and additional features that customers want,"" Tony Melone, chief technology officer at Verizon, said in a statement. AT&T and T-Mobile began rolling out Voice over LTE in select cities earlier this year. Verizon announced a nationwide launch in September, but customers cannot yet call subscribers on other networks using the technology.

The industry and Republican lawmakers have been protesting Obama's proposal, saying stricter Internet traffic regulations would stifle growth and investment.""We can't go out and invest that kind of money deploying fiber to 100 cities not knowing under what rules those investments will be governed,"" Stephenson said at an analyst conference.In April, AT&T said it would deploy its high-speed fiber network in 100 cities, including Chicago, Los Angeles and Miami. Ensuring access to quality Internet for all Americans has been the FCC's major focus. The White House detailed Obama's plan in a blog post on Monday, saying that if implemented, it ""shouldn't create any new burden for Internet providers.""Telecommunications companies plan to fight Obama's call for utility-style regulations in Congress and the courts. More than three dozen congressional Republicans on Wednesday wrote to FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler that Obama's proposed regulatory changes were ""beyond the scope of the FCC's authority.""AT&T, whose $48.5 billion bid for DirecTV is under government review, said on Friday that it would also pay $1.7 billion to acquire Mexican wireless operator Iusacell. It trimmed its 2015 capital spending outlook to $18 billion from $21 billion.At the same conference on Wednesday, Verizon Communications Inc Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo struck a somewhat lighter tone but also said the FCC could restrict ""paid prioritization"" deals, where content companies pay for faster downloads of some websites or applications, without pursuing utility-style regulations.""I think the independent agency of the FCC will make the right decision,"" Shammo said.

173,"  (Recasts with details from Verizon, analyst comment)By Christine Murray and Marina LopesMEXICO CITY/WASHINGTON Nov 12 AT&T Inc, seen as a frontrunner to buy some Mexican assets of billionaire Carlos Slim's America Movil, said on Wednesday it can succeed in Mexico without doing so, possibly putting Slim's timetable for a deal in jeopardy.Slim said in July that six months to offload assets of Mexico's largest wireless operator would be ""slow"", but four months later, on the same day AT&T downplayed interest, Verizon  said it has no interest in acquisitions in Mexico. Vodafone also has said it is unlikely to look at what Slim is offering.Other carriers have been linked to the deal, including Japan's Softbank, but none have admitted to holding talks. In a recent analyst call, America Movil  executives said they were ""not in a hurry to do the sale"".The longer the deal takes, the longer the company is subject to tough antitrust regulations including zero interconnection rates and forced infrastructure sharing, which are already affecting its results. America Movil, which has 70 percent of Mexico's mobiles and more than 60 percent of fixed lines, said it would sell assets to cut market share and avoid the rules.But AT&T, which had been seen by many analysts as the most likely buyer, said its $1.7 billion purchase of No.3 carrier Iusacell would allow it to compete without Slim's assets. ""We believe we have found a path that gets us a nice scalable growth platform without the America Movil assets,"" AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson said.""If things materialize over time and those assets look attractive we would obviously have to look at them, but we really don't need the America Movil assets to be successful.""The comments sent America Movil shares down 2.5 percent. Instead, AT&T could buy No.4 carrier Nextel, which has around 2.8 million subscribers and whose parent, NII Holdings , is going through a bankruptcy process.Stephenson said Nextel has Mexican assets AT&T would find attractive, sending shares in NII Holdings up more than 17 percent.Citigroup analysts said on Monday Nextel has valuable spectrum in the 800 MHz band that could be used to develop a 4G LTE network.Officials at Nextel and America Movil declined comment.

Edgecast customers that may have been affected include The Atlantic magazine's website and Mozilla, which uses Edgecast to deliver plug-in services for its Firefox browser, the monitoring group said.In a statement, Edgecast said there were disruptions to its operations in China. ""We have put policies in place to help our customers mitigate the effects of this most recent filtering but expect this to be an ongoing issue for our customers seeking to reach Chinese users,"" the California-based company said.

179,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, November 24 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating to  Verizon Communications Inc.'s (NYSE: -VZ) offering of EUR1.4 billion of 1.625%  senior unsecured notes due 2024 and EUR1 billion of 2.625% senior unsecured  notes due 2031. VZ plans to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes,  which may include the acquisition of spectrum licenses, and if market and other  conditions permit, the repayment of debt. Fitch currently rates VZ's Issuer  Default Rating (IDR) 'A-' with a Stable Rating Outlook. KEY RATING DRIVERS --The February 2014 acquisition of the remaining Verizon Wireless (VZW) stake  has pressured VZ's recent credit metrics, pushing pro forma leverage at closing  to approximately 2.6x. Actual gross leverage at Sept. 30, 2014 was 2.5x, with  total debt at $109.2 billion. Fitch expects VZ to materially reduce debt over  the next few years. This, combined with EBITDA growth, is expected to reduce  leverage to around 2x by the end of 2016, a level more appropriate for an 'A-'  rating. The precise timing of the reduction in leverage is subject to some  uncertainty, given the potential for spending in upcoming auctions for wireless  spectrum, a portion of which Fitch expects to be initially debt-funded. --Fitch believes metrics will return to a level appropriate for the rating in  the 2016/2017 timeframe due to VZ's strong position in the wireless industry and  the significant cash flows generated by the wireless business. This is in  combination with VZ management's commitment to delever, which has been  demonstrated in the past as evidenced by the aggressive delevering following the  acquisition of Alltel Corporation in early 2009. --A key to debt reduction over the next several years will be the continued  generation of strong free cash flow (FCF) at VZW. VZW's simple FCF (EBITDA less  capital spending) for the latest 12 months (LTM) ending Sept. 30, 2014 was  approximately $25.4 billion. Owing to the acquisition of the remaining VZW  stake, Fitch estimates VZ's FCF (after dividends and capital spending) will be  in the $4 billion to $6 billion range in 2014 as a result of transaction-related  interest costs, higher dividend requirements due to the shares issued to  Vodafone equity holders, and higher cash taxes. --VZW's strong competitive position, evidenced by industry-low churn rates on  average, high margins, and the most developed LTE network in the U.S. support  Fitch's expectations that VZ will maintain cash flow stability and support the  longer rating horizon for leverage metrics to return to levels consistent with  the rating. VZ's liquidity is supported by its reported consolidated cash balances, which  were $7.2 billion at Sept. 30, 2014, and by its revolving credit facility (RCF).  In July, Verizon amended its RCF to to $8 billion from $6.2 billion and extended  the maturity to July 2018 from August 2017. Fitch expects VZ to maintain  aggregate commercial paper (CP) balances within a level fully backed by the RCF.  The credit facility has no ratings triggers or other restrictive covenants, such  as leverage or interest coverage tests. On a consolidated basis, VZ and its subsidiaries have no material debt  maturities in 2014, and approximately $2.6 billion in 2015. In 2014, Fitch expects consolidated capital spending to be approximately $17  billion, slightly higher than the $16.6 billion spent in 2013. Investment in the  wireless network continues to be an area of emphasis due to the strong demand  for 4G LTE capacity for rapidly growing data services. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch believes a positive rating action is unlikely in the foreseeable future,  given the leverage incurred in the Vodafone transaction. Conversely, Fitch may take negative rating action if operating performance  causes deleveraging to take place at a materially slower than anticipated pace,  either alone or in combination with spending on spectrum through 2016. Fitch  estimates that even with some moderation in revenue growth and margin pressure  Verizon could spend up to $15 billion on spectrum before pressuring the rating.  Discretionary management moves that cause leverage to rise above 2.5x, such as  another material acquisition or stock repurchases, could lead to a negative  action in the absence of a strong commitment to delever.

180,"  Boston-area Verizon customers found themselves cut off from one kind of Thanksgiving bird on Thursday: the Eagles football team.Subscribers to Verizon Communications Inc's FiOS cable TV over fiber network service in Boston lost access to Fox's local affiliate station due to a fee dispute with Cox Media Group, which owns the station, according to a Verizon email to customers.That meant the subscribers woke up on Thanksgiving Day unable to watch Thursday's National Football League game between the Dallas Cowboys and the Philadelphia Eagles. Unhappy subscribers tweeted their disappointment. Using the name ""laurie bouzan,"" one user wrote: ""Verizon/Boston Fox 25 can't reach deal and no service to customers. Corporate greediness on Thanksgiving Day!""    Verizon said that Cox removed WFXT TV, the local affiliate of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's Fox TV network, and the WFXT Movies station from its FiOS TV network because it refused to accept an agreement ""that contained rates that are not in our customers' best interests."" Verizon said it was working with Cox to renew their agreement and restore the affected channels.The company was playing a 30-second video loop on Fox channels in which a woman said: ""We are working hard to get this channel back at a reasonable price. Cox-owned WFXT wants millions more in fees, which will ultimately mean higher costs for our customers. Don't you think you are paying enough for TV?"" Fox and Cox Media Group were not immediately available for comment.In a statement online, Verizon said that it is ""diligently negotiating with Cox for a retransmission deal that will be fair and reasonable for our customers."" Recently, CBS Corp and satellite operator Dish Network Corp avoided a blackout of CBS TV shows and its heavily watched Thanksgiving Day NFL game as the two sides agreed to extend a deadline into next week to try to hash out the details of a new contract.

187,"  WASHINGTON Dec 10 The U.S. National Association of Manufacturers on Wednesday wrote to congressional and Federal Communications Commission leaders to oppose potential stricter regulations for Internet service providers.The FCC is working on new rules that would dictate Internet service providers' freedom to manage web traffic on their networks, aiming to ensure that ISPs do not discriminate against any content in ways that could harm competition or consumers.President Barack Obama last month urged the FCC to set the strictest rules possible to protect net neutrality, the principle that all Internet traffic should be treated equally. For that, he suggested a legal pathway that would reclassify Internet service so it is regulated like a utility, which telecom and cable companies vehemently protest.""Current proposals to regulate the Internet with early 20th Century-era laws severely threaten continued growth... We urge you to oppose any efforts to unnecessarily regulate the open Internet,"" more than 100 members of the NAM wrote to FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler and Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Though business groups NAM and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have both previously submitted comments to the FCC opposing utility-style Internet regulations, Wednesday's letter illustrates the heated and multifaceted political battle brewing for the FCC's new rules, expected next year.Internet providers Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc are among 14,000 members of the manufacturers' association. The NAM letter's signatories included packaging company Ball Corp, tools and hardware maker Stanley Black & Decker Inc, auto technology and parts company Tenneco Inc , thermal equipment maker Modine Manufacturing Co  and industrial conglomerate Emerson Electric Co.The letter also went to Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker, National Economic Council Director Jeffrey Zients and Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Jason Furman. ""The Internet and technology is a critical tool for manufacturers to grow their business,"" NAM Technology Policy President Brian Raymond said in an interview. ""(Our members) get concerned if the government is going to slow down their business in any way and they see this as one of those ways.""Raymond cited as one worrying indicator AT&T's recent warning that it will pause investments in new high-speed Internet connections until net neutrality rules are settled.""Whenever there's a pause in investment by any kind of company due to regulatory uncertainty, it's going to have a trickle-down effect on the whole manufacturing community,"" he said.

Hutchinson said Spirent also benefited from more business from Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and from service providers and equipment manufacturers in China.The company, which had warned in November that weak market conditions in the third quarter would stay for the rest of 2014, estimated full-year 2014 revenue at about $455 million, a 10 percent jump from a year earlier.Spirent said on Thursday that fourth-quarter order intake rose nearly 13 percent to about $147 million, with revenue of about $124 million, at the upper end of its expectations. Orders from the Americas grew 7 percent in the year, while those from the Asia-Pacific region rose 5 percent, Chief Financial Officer Rachel Whiting told Reuters.The United States accounted for 50 percent of Spirent's 2013 revenue, while Asia-Pacific contributed about 35 percent.AT&T's said in November it would cut spending in 2015, one of many such decisions by telecom companies over the past few months in an industry grappling with potential merger activity and assessing new technology deployments.CEO Hutchinson said orders from two large clients and some equipment makers had reduced by as much as $30 million in 2014.Spirent shares were up 10.8 percent at 87.25 pence at 1320 GMT.

213,"   By David Morgan | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The Obama administration on Monday unveiled an ambitious plan to control health costs by moving the $2.9 trillion U.S. health systems away from costly fee-for-service medicine, beginning with the Medicare program for the elderly and disabled.By the end of 2018, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell told reporters that 50 percent of traditional Medicare's $362 billion in annual payments would go to doctors, hospitals and other providers that participate in alternative payment models which emphasize cost containment and quality of care.Officials, who hope to see the initiative matched by private insurers, employers and state Medicaid programs for the poor, said the move was intended to head off a resurgence in healthcare cost growth from an historically low 3.6 percent in 2013 to a projected 6.6 percent in 2020.The administration announced its goals after Burwell met with private and public sector stakeholders including insurers, consumer and provider groups and employers Boeing Co and Verizon Communications Inc. Wall Street analysts said for-profit hospitals and private insurers would be well positioned to benefit from a new shift toward lower-cost care delivery.Groups representing doctors and hospitals said the move could mean greater flexibility for their members in determining care delivery, while consumer representatives said the unprecedented goals could boost the quality of care. About 20 percent of traditional Medicare payments, a sum worth $72 billion, currently go to providers with cost-saving business models. The remainder are based on fee-for-service payments that reward providers for the volume of care they provide. Fee-for-service has been blamed by policymakers for promoting higher costs, mediocre care and unnecessary procedures.The administration's goals would be phased in by first increasing the participation of alternative care models to 30 percent of Medicare payments by the end of 2016.

214,"  (Adds details on employers, Wall Street,  stakeholders, background)By David MorganWASHINGTON Jan 26 The Obama administration on Monday unveiled an ambitious plan to control health costs by moving the $2.9 trillion U.S. health systems away from costly fee-for-service medicine, beginning with the Medicare program for the elderly and disabled.By the end of 2018, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell told reporters that 50 percent of traditional Medicare's $362 billion in annual payments would go to doctors, hospitals and other providers that participate in alternative payment models which emphasize cost containment and quality of care.Officials, who hope to see the initiative matched by private insurers, employers and state Medicaid programs for the poor, said the move was intended to head off a resurgence in healthcare cost growth from an historically low 3.6 percent in 2013 to a projected 6.6 percent in 2020. The administration announced its goals after Burwell met with private and public sector stakeholders including insurers, consumer and provider groups and employers Boeing Co and Verizon Communications Inc.Wall Street analysts said for-profit hospitals and private insurers would be well positioned to benefit from a new shift toward lower-cost care delivery. Groups representing doctors and hospitals said the move could mean greater flexibility for their members in determining care delivery, while consumer representatives said the unprecedented goals could boost the quality of care.About 20 percent of traditional Medicare payments, a sum worth $72 billion, currently go to providers with cost-saving business models. The remainder are based on fee-for-service payments that reward providers for the volume of care they provide. Fee-for-service has been blamed by policymakers for promoting higher costs, mediocre care and unnecessary procedures. The administration's goals would be phased in by first increasing the participation of alternative care models to 30 percent of Medicare payments by the end of 2016.Officials described the 50 percent goal for 2018 as a ""tipping point"" that could help make payment reform mainstream across the U.S. health system.Within four years, the administration expects all but 10 percent of traditional Medicare to be linked to new quality and efficiency standards, including most of the remaining fee-for- service providers.The government has also been experimenting with payment models that officials say have generated $417 million in savings to Medicare.

218,"  (Adds FCC chairman statement, details)By Alina Selyukh and Malathi NayakWASHINGTON Jan 29 The U.S. Federal Communications Commission raised a record $44.9 billion in the auction of so-called AWS-3 airwaves that closed on Thursday, marking the highest point yet in the wireless industry's appetite for more spectrum.Wireless carriers Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T Inc and T-Mobile US Inc, satellite TV provider Dish Network Corp and others vied for new slices of airwaves to satisfy the growing consumer demand for streaming video and other data-guzzling applications.Regulators will disclose the winners of the auctioned spectrum licenses in the coming days. The auction presented the largest opportunity for companies to buy new wireless spectrum since 2008. But it shattered the expectations of analysts and the FCC, barrelling past the reserve price of $10.1 billion in the first week of bidding and more than doubling the haul of the biggest previous auction.""By their actions, wireless carriers have demonstrated the importance of new spectrum,"" FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler told reporters on Thursday as he received congratulations from lawmakers and industry executives. The proceeds will pay for a new $7 billion public safety network and boost the Treasury's coffers. Wheeler cited one forecast that the new spectrum might boost U.S. GDP by billions and add tens of thousands of new jobs.The auction will also be important to Dish, which already owns similar airwaves whose value will now be crystallized for the first time. Its shares had hit an all-time peak during the course of the auction and rose 3.1 percent to $73.75 on Thursday afternoon. The FCC now looks to 2016, when it plans to hold its largest and most complex auction yet of the low-frequency airwaves which are highly coveted for their strength and reach. Sprint Corp , which sat out the AWS-3 auction, is expected to join other bidders in that planned auction.Investors have worried that AT&T and Verizon may have overspent in the AWS-3 auction, but analysts argue that more spectrum will help carriers expand their network capacity as they tackle intense competition in the near saturated wireless market.Based on their debt-raising patterns, AT&T may have purchased more than Verizon, said Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research. He expects AT&T to pay between $20 billion to $22 billion and Verizon to spend in the range of $14 billion to $16 billion in the auction.Canada's government plans to auction off similar AWS-3 airwaves in March.

228,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 02 (Fitch) On Jan. 30, 2015, the Federal Communications  Commission (FCC) announced the winning bidders in the AWS-3 spectrum action.  Verizon Communications Inc.'s (Verizon; NYSE: VZ) total winning bids amounted to  approximately $10.4 billion. This amount was well under the level which would  have triggered a negative rating action ($15 billion) by Fitch. In Fitch's view,  Verizon's ratings (Issuer Default Rating and senior unsecured debt of  'A-') and Stable Outlook are unaffected by this action. Although Verizon has not disclosed detailed funding plans to pay for the  spectrum, Fitch does not expect Verizon to have significant debt funding needs,  as its consolidated cash balances were $10.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2014. In  addition to cash, the company has an $8 billion revolving credit facility (RCF).  Verizon's total net remaining payment is $9.5 billion, net of a $0.9 billion  upfront downpayment made prior to the start of the auction in November 2014,  with approximately $1.2 billion due February 13 and the final balance due March  2. Verizon will acquire 181 licenses, covering a population of 192 million, or 61%  of the U.S. The spectrum enhances Verizon's relatively deep existing AWS  spectrum portfolio, which was built in the 2006 AWS spectrum auction and through  acquisitions, including 2012 acquisitions of spectrum from cable companies. KEY RATING DRIVERS --The February 2014 acquisition of the remaining Verizon Wireless (VZW) stake  has pressured Verizon's recent credit metrics, pushing pro forma leverage at  closing to approximately 2.6x. Gross leverage at Dec. 31, 2014 was 2.6x, with  total debt at $113.3 billion. Net leverage was approximately 2.3x, and  incorporates cash built in anticipation of potential spectrum funding; cash  stood at $10.6 billion at year-end. --Going forward, Fitch expects Verizon to materially reduce debt over the next  few years. Debt reduction, combined with EBITDA growth, is expected to reduce  leverage to a level appropriate for the rating in the 2016/2017 timeframe as a  result of Verizon's strong position in the wireless industry and the significant  cash flows generated by the wireless business. This is in combination with  Verizon management's commitment to delever, which has been demonstrated in the  past as evidenced by the aggressive delevering following the acquisition of  Alltel Corporation in early 2009. --A key to debt reduction over the next several years will be the continued  generation of strong free cash flow (FCF) at VZW. VZW's simple FCF (EBITDA less  capital spending) for 2014 was approximately $24.7 billion. Owing to the  acquisition of the remaining VZW stake, Verizon's FCF (after dividends and  capital spending) was affected by transaction-related interest costs, higher  dividend requirements due to the shares issued to Vodafone equity holders, and  higher cash taxes. Despite these factors, 2014 FCF of $6 billion was at the high  end of Fitch's estimated range of $4 billion to $6 billion. --VZW's strong competitive position, evidenced by industry-low churn rates on  average, high margins, and the most developed LTE network in the U.S., support  Fitch's expectations that Verizon will maintain cash flow stability and support  the longer rating horizon for leverage metrics to return to levels consistent  with the rating. Verizon's liquidity is supported by its reported consolidated cash balances,  which were $10.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2014, and by its RCF. The $8 billion RCF  matures in July 2018. Fitch expects Verizon to maintain aggregate commercial  paper (CP) balances within a level fully backed by the RCF. The credit facility  has no rating triggers or other restrictive covenants, such as leverage or  interest coverage tests. On a consolidated basis, Verizon and its subsidiaries have maturities of  approximately $2.6 billion in 2015. In 2015, Fitch expects consolidated capital spending to be approximately $17.8  billion, slightly higher than the $17.2 billion spent in 2014. Investment in the  wireless network continues to be an area of emphasis due to the strong demand  for 4G LTE capacity for rapidly growing data services. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch believes a positive rating action is unlikely in the foreseeable future,  given the leverage incurred in the Vodafone transaction. Conversely, Fitch may take negative rating action if operating performance  causes delevering to take place at a materially slower than anticipated pace,  either alone or in combination with material debt-financed acquisitions.  Discretionary management moves that cause leverage to rise above 2.5x, such as  another material acquisition or stock repurchases, could lead to a negative  action in the absence of a strong commitment to delever.

238,"   By Liana B. Baker and Malathi Nayak | NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO  NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO Feb 4 Verizon Communications is close to selling wireline assets worth $10 billion to regional telephone operator Frontier Communications Corp, a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.The largest U.S. carrier by subscribers, Verizon has been investing heavily in growing its wireless business while reducing spend on its broadband Internet and telephone services. Verizon has been exploring steps to speed up its debt repayment in recent months.The companies did a similar deal in 2009, when Verizon sold 4.8 million rural phone lines to Frontier for $8.6 billion in stock and cash, to do away with that business and focus on wireless and broadband services. A Verizon spokesman declined to comment while a representative for Frontier could not be reached. Verizon purchased 181 licenses worth $10.4 billion in a government sale of wireless airwaves for mobile data that closed last week. That came on top of $130 billion it spent in 2013 to buy from Vodafone the 45 percent in its wireless unit  that it did not already own.The wireline assets being sold to Frontier are the latest in a series of non-core assets Verizon has sold in recent months. It is also looking to sell $5 billion in wireless towers, Reuters previously reported.

BakerSAN FRANCISCO Feb 5 Verizon Communications  said it would sell wireline assets to Frontier Communications for $10.54 billion in cash and sell and lease cell phone towers for around $5 billion to American Tower in a deal that will help it pay off recent wireless spectrum purchases.The transaction is the latest in a series of non-core assets that Verizon has sold in recent months to reduce debt and raise cash for investments.The Frontier sale is expected to close in the first half of next year and is subject to regulatory approval, the companies said.Frontier will nearly double its size by buying Verizon's local wireline operations in California, Florida and Texas, including 3.7 million voice customers, 1.2 million video customers and 2.2 million broadband connections. ""Over 50 percent of these networks are fiber to the home so these are outstanding assets in high growth areas,"" said Frontier CEO Maggie Wilderotter in an interview.Boston-based American Tower said Verizon would lease over 11,300 towers and sell 165 towers for $5.06 billion. Verizon also announced plans to buy back shares worth $5 billion.The largest U.S. carrier by subscribers, Verizon purchased 181 licenses worth $10.4 billion in a government sale of wireless airwaves for mobile data that closed last week.

The company has been doubling down on its wireless business while spending less on broadband Internet and telephone services.Verizon did a similar deal with Frontier in 2009, when it sold 4.8 million rural phone lines to Frontier for $8.6 billion in stock and cash. Frontier will receive a $1.9 billion tax benefit as part of the transaction.Shares in Frontier rose more than 5 percent after closing at $7.70 in trading after market close on Thursday.

244,"   By Malathi Nayak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK AT&T Inc (T.N) will link its connected car and smart home technologies to bolster its foothold in the fast-growing market for Internet-connected devices, a new battleground for the company and rivals ranging from Verizon (VZ.N) to Google Inc (GOOGL.O).The wireless company's home security and automation service ""Digital Life"" and connected car service ""Drive"" will be integrated so users can control their homes from a dashboard in their vehicles, Glenn Lurie, chief executive of AT&T Mobility told Reuters last week ahead of the company's announcement at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. ""Once you’ve told your home when the car is (for instance)within 20 feet of the house to please open the garage door, put the lights on, turn the alarm off, move the thermostat up, you can have those inanimate objects, the home and your car, really taking care of you,"" Lurie said.With the two services linked up, a ""Drive"" car can control devices in the home, including security cameras, air-conditioners, coffee makers, stereo systems, door locks, alarm sensors on windows and sensors that detect leaks from water pipes.   Most Americans own a mobile phone, and the $1.7 trillion U.S. wireless industry is turning for growth to connected devices. AT&T said it had about 20 million connected devices from cars to cargo ship container sensors in 2014, up 21 percent from the year earlier. It has not yet revealed its revenue from its ""Internet of Things"" business. Technology companies including Apple and Google are making their own plays. Mercedes-Benz has an application that lets drivers control thermostats from Nest, a company acquired by Google. Analysts expect fast growth from the ""Internet of Things"", or web-connected machines and gadgets. Connected car revenue is expected to be $20 billion annually by 2018 from $3 billion in 2013, and smart homes revenue is estimated to touch $71 billion by 2018, according to Juniper Research.AT&T has deals with eight automakers from General Motors (GM.N) to Ford (F.N)  on connected car services. Lurie said it was still signing deals.On the home front, it has partnered with home appliance makers such as Samsung and LG Electronics. Customers will pay for the new service through AT&T's Mobile Share Value plan. A user can add $10 to the monthly phone bill to share data across multiple connected devices such as wearables and cars, Lurie said. Or customers can opt for plans provided by their car manufacturer. In the fourth quarter of 2014, AT&T said it added 800,000 connected cars out of 1.3 million connected devices it added to its network.

246,"   By Sarah McBride | AUSTIN, Tx., March 16  AUSTIN, Tx., March 16 As his likely rivals spent the weekend shaking hands in New Hampshire, potential Republican candidate Rand Paul flew to Texas to court the software developers and entrepreneurs who are likely to play a central role in the 2016 election.The libertarian-leaning Kentucky Senator tweeted, Snapchatted and Instagrammed his way through the South by Southwest Interactive conference as he sought to make inroads among an independent-minded crowd that could serve as an important source of money, votes and programming talent for his expected presidential bid.""If you want talent you gotta go where the talent is,"" he said on Monday.It was the first time a potential candidate has participated in the conference, according to organizers. Paul spent much of the weekend talking about the shared DNA of the tech community and the libertarian movement, but he spent little time talking about net neutrality, the thorny question of how to ensure that all Internet traffic is treated equally.While many tech companies back recently approved rules that broadband providers such as Verizon and Comcast should be regulated like utilities, Paul and other Republicans have argued that the new regulations will choke off innovation.It's an argument he has made in great detail in other forums. In front of this crowd, he framed the debate in the broadest terms possible. ""I don't want the government to screw up one of the greatest technologies we've had,"" he told the conference on Sunday, drawing applause.The applause that line drew came as a surprise for tech consultant Warren Hanes, who said he thought many at the conference weren't aware of his opposition to the new rules.""It's possible there are people who simply responded emotionally to the issue of less regulation,"" he said. TECHNOLOGY ARMS RACE Paul's decision to spend the weekend in Texas, rather than early-voting states like Iowa or New Hampshire, highlight the crucial role the technology industry is likely to play in 2016 - both as a source of money and talent. While former Florida Governor Jeb Bush has locked down many big donors on Wall Street and Florida Senator Marco Rubio has made inroads with the billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch, Paul has worked hard to cultivate ties in Silicon Valley, where many entrepreneurs share his frustration with government eavesdropping.Campaigns have also engaged in a technology arms race since 2004 to find ever more sophisticated ways to target voters. Planting the flag at South by Southwest could help Paul build a cutting-edge operation.On Monday, he opened an office for his political-action committee at the Capital Factory, a shared-office space for technology startups in a downtown Austin high-rise.The tech industry gave twice as much money to Democratic President Barack Obama than his Republican rival Mitt Romney in the 2012 election.Paul's conservative stances on social issues like gay marriage and abortion could prove troubling for many in the industry, where liberal social views are widespread. Mozilla Corp. CEO Brendan Eich, for example, resigned under pressure in 2014 after board members objected to his support for a previous campaign against gay marriage.Paul's views on social issues are ""a real problem for people like me,"" said Jeff Boedeker, a producer at a multimedia company. Still, he says he believes the final say on abortion and same sex marriage will go to the courts, not the president, making support of Paul more palatable.

250,"   By Malathi Nayak | NEW YORK, March 18  NEW YORK, March 18 Sony Corp on Wednesday launched its PlayStation Vue Web video service in three cities, targeting customers looking for cheaper alternatives to cable with packages starting at $50.The Web and cloud-based television service, which allows users to access live TV and on-demand video, has been in test mode since November. Sony joins several new competitors in online video services with one of the largest packages of channels.Vue will be available initially on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 video game consoles in New York, Chicago and Philadelphia starting Wednesday, then expand to other cities and for iPad users shortly.Sony's service will have more than 85 channels, including programming from three major networks, CBS, Fox   and NBCUniversal in addition to media companies Discovery Communications, Scripps Networks Interactive , Turner Broadcasting and Viacom. The $50-per-month starter package offers over 50 channels. AMC Network content will also be available from April, said Eric Lempel, vice president of business and operations, Americas at Sony Network Entertainment. More content deals were in the works, he added.Viewers can also opt for a $60-a-month package that also includes local sports channels. A $70-a-month service adds some music, lifestyle and family channels, Sony said. PlayStation Vue will compete with Dish Network Corp , which unveiled a $20-a-month video streaming service, named Sling TV, targeted at younger consumers who shun pricey cable and satellite subscriptions. Netflix Inc and Amazon Inc have been offering on-demand online video content through licensing deals with media networks for years.Wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc is gearing up to launch its own online video service this summer. Sling TV is available through Internet-connected devices such as Amazon Fire TV, Roku and Google Inc's Nexus Player for TVs, tablets, computers and smartphones and includes TV programming from ABC, ESPN and Maker Studios, Time Warner's  TNT, CNN, TBS, Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, and Food Network, HGTV and Travel Channel.Apple Inc is in talks with programmers to offer a slimmed-down bundle of about 25 channels, including ABC, CBS and Fox networks this fall, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.That would be available across all devices powered by Apple's iOS operating system, including iPhones, iPads and Apple TV set-top boxes, the newspaper said.

251,"   By Malathi Nayak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Verizon Communications Inc may rely largely on advertising for revenue from its upcoming online video service, Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said in an interview.This could set the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier apart from rival online video services such as Dish Network Corp's Sling TV and Sony Corp's PlayStation Vue, which offer traditional TV content with ads and collect subscription fees. Original online programing on Verizon's service could use an ""advertising-type"" model, ""not necessarily a consumer-pay model,"" Shammo said in the recent interview.Most Americans own a mobile phone, and Verizon is looking at online video delivery to increase data consumption on mobile devices and increase revenue.  The digital video service, which it expects to release in mid-2015, is aimed at families and younger viewers who increasingly consume content on mobile devices.Earlier this month, Verizon announced a deal to add original online programing to its service from DreamWorks Animation and its AwesomenessTV unit that is known for creating popular content aimed at teens and younger adults known as millennials on Google Inc's YouTube.  More content deals are in the works, Shammo said.Dish’s Sling TV is a $20-a-month online video streaming service. Sony's new PlayStation Vue Web offers more than 85 channels, starting at $50. Apple Inc is in talks with programmers to offer a slimmed-down bundle of about 25 channels, the Wall Street Journal reported this month. Verizon executives have said the company's ""mobile-first"" service will offer 20 to 30 channels and that they also see a market for streaming original content. As the company crafts a revenue model for its new service, it is also contemplating ""pay-per-view"" options for live streamed coverage of concerts and sporting events as technology evolves, Shammo said. Verizon has said it plans to use a technology called multicasting, which can be used to stream live video to multiple mobile devices through a single lane of airwaves. But mobile device makers have only recently begun installing chipsets that support this, executives have said.The service was developed by integrating Verizon's ""OnCue"" video streaming technology that the company purchased from Intel Corp in 2014 and its Digital Media Services technology, which formats content and splices in ads.   (Reporting by Malathi Nayak; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)",2015-03-26,VZ,"Thu Mar 26, 2015 | 11:07am EDT",Verizon's online video service revenue may depend on ads: CFO,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-verizon-video-idUSKBN0MM1YX20150326?type=companyNews
252,"   By Jeremy Wagstaff  Hackers, most likely from China, have been spying on governments and businesses in Southeast Asia and India uninterrupted for a decade, researchers at internet security company FireEye Inc  said.In a report released on Monday, FireEye said the cyber espionage operations dated back to at least 2005 and ""focused on targets - government and commercial - who hold key political, economic and military information about the region.""""Such a sustained, planned development effort coupled with the (hacking) group's regional targets and mission, lead us to believe that this activity is state-sponsored - most likely the Chinese government,"" the report's authors said.Bryce Boland, Chief Technology Officer for Asia Pacific at FireEye and co-author of the report, said the attack was still ongoing, noting that the servers the attackers used were still operational, and that FireEye continued to see attacks against its customers, who number among the targets.Reuters couldn't independently confirm any of the assertions made in the report.China has always denied accusations that it uses the Internet to spy on governments, organizations and companies. Asked about the FireEye report on Monday, foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei said: ""I want to stress that the Chinese government resolutely bans and cracks down on any hacking acts. This position is clear and consistent. Hacking attacks are a joint problem faced by the international community and need to be dealt with cooperatively rather than via mutual censure.""The Cyberspace Administration of China, the Internet regulator, didn't immediately respond to written requests for comment. China has been accused before of targeting countries in South and Southeast Asia. In 2011, researchers from McAfee reported a campaign dubbed Shady Rat which attacked Asian governments and institutions, among other targets. Efforts by the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to build cyber defenses have been sporadic. While ASEAN has long acknowledged its importance, ""very little has come of this discourse,"" said Miguel Gomez, a researcher at De La Salle University in the Philippines. The problem is not new: Singapore has reported sophisticated cyber-espionage attacks on civil servants in several ministries dating back to 2004. UNDETECTED The campaign described by FireEye differs from other such operations mostly in its scale and longevity, Boland said.He said the group appeared to include at least two software developers. The report did not offer other indications of the possible size of the group or where it's based.The group remained undetected for so long it was able to re-use methods and malware dating back to 2005, and developed its own system to manage and prioritize attacks, even organizing shifts to cope with the workload and different languages of its targets, Boland told Reuters. The attackers focused not only on governments, but on ASEAN itself, as well as corporations and journalists interested in China. Other targets included Indian or Southeast Asian-based companies in sectors such as construction, energy, transport, telecommunications and aviation, FireEye says. Mostly they sought to gain access by sending so-called phishing emails to targets purported to come from colleagues or trusted sources, and containing documents relevant to their interests.Boland said it wasn't possible to gauge the damage done as it had taken place over such a long period, but he said the impact could be ""massive"". ""Without being able to detect it, there's no way these agencies can work out what the impacts are. They don't know what has been stolen.""Pornchai Rujiprapa, Minister of Information and Communication Technology for ASEAN member Thailand, said the government was proposing a new law to combat cyber attacks as existing legislation was outdated. ""So far we haven't found any attack so big it threatens national security, but we are concerned if there is any in the future. That's why we need a new law to handle it,"" he told Reuters.

253,"  (Repeats story with no change to text)By Joseph MennApril 14 When a cyber security breach hits the news, those most closely involved often have incentive to play up the sophistication of the attack.If hackers are portrayed as well-funded geniuses, victims look less vulnerable, security firms can flog their products and services, and government officials can push for tougher regulation or seek more money for cyber defenses.But two deeply researched reports being released this week underscore the less-heralded truth: the vast majority of hacking attacks are successful because employees click on links in tainted emails, companies fail to apply available patches to known software flaws, or technicians do not configure systems properly.These conclusions will be in the minds of executives attending the world's largest technology security conference next week in San Francisco, a conference named after lead sponsor RSA, the security division of EMC Corp.In the best-known annual study of data breaches, a report from Verizon Communications Inc to be released on Wednesday found that more than two-thirds of the 290 electronic espionage cases it learned about in 2014 involved phishing, the security industry's term for trick emails.Because so many people click on tainted links or attachments, sending phishing emails to just 10 employees will get hackers inside corporate gates 90 percent of the time, Verizon found.""There's an overarching pattern,"" said Verizon scientist Bob Rudis. Attackers use phishing to install malware and steal credentials from employees, then they use those credentials to roam through networks and access programs and files, he said. Verizon's report includes its own business investigations and data from 70 other contributors, including law enforcement. It found that while major new vulnerabilities such as Heartbleed  are being used by hackers within hours of their announcement, more attacks last year exploited patchable vulnerabilities dating from 2007, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013.Another annual cyber report, to be released on Tuesday by Symantec Corp, found that state-sponsored spies also used phishing techniques because they work and because the less-sophisticated approach drew less scrutiny from defenders.Once inside a system, however, the spies turned fancy, writing customized software to evade detection by whatever security programs the target has installed, Symantec said.""Once I'm in, I can do what I need to,"" said Robert Shaker, an incident response manager at Symantec. The report drew on data from 57 million sensors in 157 countries and territories. Another troubling trend Symantec found involves the use of ""ransomware,"" in which hackers encrypt a computer's files and promise to release them only if the user pays a ransom. (Some 80 percent of the time, they do not decrypt the files even then.)The new twist comes from hackers who encrypt files, including those inside critical infrastructure facilities, but do not ask for anything. The mystery is why: Shaker said it is not clear whether the attackers are securing the information for resale to other spies or potential saboteurs, or whether they plan on making their own demands in the future.RSA CONFERENCE  At next week's RSA Conference, protecting critical infrastructure systems under increasing attack will be a major theme. Another theme will be the need for more sharing of ""intelligence"" about emerging threats - between the public and private sectors, within the security industry, and within certain industries.While many of the biggest breaches of the past two years involved retailers, the healthcare industry has figured heavily in recent months. Former FBI futurist Marc Goodman said that both spies and organized criminals are likely at work, the former seeking leverage to use in recruiting informants and the latter looking to cash in on medical and insurance fraud.Verizon's researchers said that to be most effective, information-sharing would have to be essentially in real time, from machine to machine, and cross multiple sectors, a daunting proposition.Another section of the Verizon report could help security executives make the case for bigger budgets. The researchers produced the first analysis of the actual costs of breaches derived from insurance claims, instead of survey data.Verizon said the best indicator of the cost of an incident is the number of records compromised, and that the cost rises logarithmically, flattening as the size of the breach rises.According to the new Verizon model, the loss of 100,000 records should cost roughly $475,000 on average, while 100 million lost records should cost about $8.85 million.Though the harder data will be welcome to number-crunchers, spending more money cannot guarantee complete protection against attacks.The RSA Conference floor will feature vendors touting next-generation security products and anomaly-spotting big-data analytics. But few will actually promise that they can stop someone from clicking on a tainted email and letting a hacker in.

It has also tried to diversify and add a new stream of revenue by acquiring jerky maker Krave Pure Foods Inc in January, marking its first foray into meat snacks.

279,"   By Jennifer Saba, Devika  Krishna Kumar and Abhirup Roy  Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) is buying AOL Inc AOL.N in a $4.4 billion bet that a push into mobile video and targeted advertising can help the biggest U.S. telecommunications company find new growth avenues.  AOL and its properties, including the Huffington Post, TechCrunch and Engadget websites, would become a Verizon subsidiary, with AOL Chief Executive Officer Tim Armstrong staying in his job. The companies announced the deal on Tuesday.Armstrong, who has been building up AOL's expertise in technology for placing text and video ads on mobile phones, sees mobile representing 80 percent of media consumption in coming years. ""If we are going to lead, we need to lead in mobile,"" Armstrong said in a memo to employees on Tuesday.Global revenue from online video ads is forecast reaching $19 billion by 2017 from about $11 billion last year, cutting into television ad revenue, according to research firm IHS. Verizon has over 100 million mobile consumers, content deals with the likes of the National Football League and ""a meaningful strategy"" in mobile video, Armstrong said.It will need to buy telecommunications spectrum aggressively to accommodate rising mobile video traffic. For Wall Street, the deal is about the technology. ""AOL's ad-tech offering has been driving its growth for some time now as the Internet business has faded,"" Dan Ridsdale, an analyst at Edison Investment Research, said in a note to clients. ""This acquisition is aimed at enabling Verizon to maximize its revenues from mobile video.”Verizon, which last year bought the assets of OnCue, Intel's (INTC.O) Internet-based TV platform, has been building a video streaming product to expand beyond slow-growth wireless services. Verizon's $50-per-share offer represents a premium of 17.4 percent to AOL's Monday close. AOL shares jumped 18.4 percent to $50.41, while Dow Jones industrials component Verizon dipped 0.4 percent to $49.63. Armstrong told Reuters that talks between Verizon and AOL started last year. He met with Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam last July about how to further their partnership. Armstrong said he has a multiyear commitment to stay with Verizon and run AOL as a separate division but declined to give further details. ""GETTING A HODGEPODGE"" The proposed acquisition was the latest example of how established telecommunications companies look to make deals to jump-start growth as mobile phone expansion slows. AT&T Inc (T.N), the second biggest U.S. telecom company, is also betting on video, agreeing to buy No. 1 U.S. satellite TV provider DirecTV DTV.O, for $48.5 billion. The deal is pending.  Advertising has become a major revenue stream for AOL, helped by the acquisition of automated advertising platforms such as Adap.tv. Demand for the real-time bidding platform that helps advertisers place video and display ads helped AOL beat sales and profit forecasts in its most recent quarter.For AOL, the deal caps a years-long period of reinvention into an advertising technology company. At the peak of the dot-com boom, AOL, whose dial-up Internet service once counted tens of millions of subscribers, used its elevated stock price to buy conglomerate Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) in one of the most disastrous corporate mergers in history. Spun off from Time Warner in 2009, AOL shares returned to the New York Stock Exchange, opening at $27 in November 2009. The Verizon bid values AOL below its January 2014 high of $53.28. Shares have fallen in three of the last five quarters but are well above last year's low of $32.31, leading some analysts to question whether Verizon was overpaying. ""There’s the question of whether there is truly an advantage in owning all of this themselves,"" said Craig Moffett of media research firm MoffettNathanson. ""They are getting a hodgepodge of ancillary assets that may be as much a distraction as a benefit."" AOL has held talks to spin off Huffington Post as part of the Verizon deal, potentially valuing the news and commentary website at $1 billion, technology news site Re/code reported Tuesday, citing sources. Verizon viewed Huffington Post and the media brands as an attractive part of the AOL deal and has no immediate plans to sell them or spin them off, a source familiar with the matter said.Verizon was showing signs of desperation as its core wireless business comes under pressure, Macquarie Capital analysts wrote in a note. ""We feel that Verizon paid a hefty price ... for what we believe to be an unproven programmatic ad-tech platform in the nascent video ad-tech space,"" they said.Verizon said it expects the deal, which includes about $300 million in AOL debt, to close this summer.LionTree Advisors, Weil Gotshal & Manges and Guggenheim Partners advised Verizon. AOL's advisers were Allen & Co Llc and Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz.

""To the extent you have an increase in interest rates that the Fed doesn't control, you're getting an unwanted tightening in the financial markets.""Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields touched their highest since mid-November earlier before coming down slightly. Elevated U.S. yields mean higher borrowing costs, which can make it harder for companies to expand.That rise in borrowing costs comes as investors attempt to gauge when the Fed will deem the U.S. economy strong enough to begin raising its own interest rate for the first time since 2006.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 36.94 points, or 0.2 percent, to end at 18,068.23. The S&P 500 lost 6.21 points, or 0.29 percent, to finish at 2,099.12 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 17.38 points, or 0.35 percent, to 4,976.19. If borrowing costs eventually rise enough to threaten the U.S. economic recovery, the Fed will have few options at its disposal since its key interest rate is already near zero, Awad said.The growing uncertainty about interest rates comes as the S&P 500 trades near 17 times expected earnings, expensive compared to its 10-year median average of 15 times earnings.AOL shares jumped 18.62 percent to end at $50.52 after Verizon Communications said it would buy the company in a $4.4 billion deal, or $50 per share. Verizon declined 0.36 percent.. Apple, the biggest contributor to losses on the Nasdaq and S&P 500, dipped 0.36 percent.Eight of the 10 major S&P 500 sectors were down, with the materials index leading the declines with a 1.03 percent fall.The S&P energy index gained 0.44 percent as oil prices rose about 3 percent due to a weaker dollar and conflict in Yemen.Pall Corp rose 19.44 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported the water and air filter maker was in the final stages of an auction to sell itself.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,679 to 1,367, for a 1.23-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 1,556 issues fell and 1,187 advanced for a 1.31-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.The S&P 500 posted 4 new 52-week highs and 6 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 59 new highs and 60 new lows.About 5.9 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.8 billion daily average for the last five sessions, according to BATS Global Markets.

281,"  * Offers $50/share in major move into mobile video* Analyst questions advantage to ""owning all of this""* AOL shares jump 18.4 pct; Verizon down 0.4 pct   (Adds links to graphic, Breakingviews TV)By Jennifer Saba, Devika  Krishna Kumar and Abhirup RoyMay 12 Verizon Communications Inc is buying AOL Inc in a $4.4 billion bet that a push into mobile video and targeted advertising can help the biggest U.S. telecommunications company find new growth avenues.AOL and its properties, including the Huffington Post, TechCrunch and Engadget websites, would become a Verizon subsidiary, with AOL Chief Executive Officer Tim Armstrong staying in his job. The companies announced the deal on Tuesday.Armstrong, who has been building up AOL's expertise in technology for placing text and video ads on mobile phones, sees mobile representing 80 percent of media consumption in coming years.""If we are going to lead, we need to lead in mobile,"" Armstrong said in a memo to employees on Tuesday.Global revenue from online video ads is forecast reaching $19 billion by 2017 from about $11 billion last year, cutting into television ad revenue, according to research firm IHS.Verizon has over 100 million mobile consumers, content deals with the likes of the National Football League and ""a meaningful strategy"" in mobile video, Armstrong said.It will need to buy telecommunications spectrum aggressively to accommodate rising mobile video traffic. For Wall Street, the deal is about the technology. ""AOL's ad-tech offering has been driving its growth for some time now as the Internet business has faded,"" Dan Ridsdale, an analyst at Edison Investment Research, said in a note to clients. ""This acquisition is aimed at enabling Verizon to maximise its revenues from mobile video.""Verizon, which last year bought the assets of OnCue, Intel's  Internet-based TV platform, has been building a video streaming product to expand beyond slow-growth wireless services.Verizon's $50-per-share offer represents a premium of 17.4 percent to AOL's Monday close. AOL shares jumped 18.4 percent to $50.41, while Dow Jones industrials component Verizon dipped 0.4 percent to $49.63.Armstrong told Reuters that talks between Verizon and AOL started last year. He met with Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam last July about how to further their partnership.Armstrong said he has a multiyear commitment to stay with Verizon and run AOL as a separate division but declined to give further details. ""GETTING A HODGEPODGE"" The proposed acquisition was the latest example of how established telecommunications companies look to make deals to jump-start growth as mobile phone expansion slows. AT&T Inc , the second biggest U.S. telecom company, is also betting on video, agreeing to buy No. 1 U.S. satellite TV provider DirecTV, for $48.5 billion. The deal is pending.Advertising has become a major revenue stream for AOL, helped by the acquisition of automated advertising platforms such as Adap.tv. Demand for the real-time bidding platform that helps advertisers place video and display ads helped AOL beat sales and profit forecasts in its most recent quarter.For AOL, the deal caps a years-long period of reinvention into an advertising technology company.At the peak of the dot-com boom, AOL, whose dial-up Internet service once counted tens of millions of subscribers, used its elevated stock price to buy conglomerate Time Warner Inc  in one of the most disastrous corporate mergers in history. Spun off from Time Warner in 2009, AOL shares returned to the New York Stock Exchange, opening at $27 in November 2009.The Verizon bid values AOL below its January 2014 high of $53.28. Shares have fallen in three of the last five quarters but are well above last year's low of $32.31, leading some analysts to question whether Verizon was overpaying.""There's the question of whether there is truly an advantage in owning all of this themselves,"" said Craig Moffett of media research firm MoffettNathanson. ""They are getting a hodgepodge of ancillary assets that may be as much a distraction as a benefit.""AOL has held talks to spin off Huffington Post as part of the Verizon deal, potentially valuing the news and commentary website at $1 billion, technology news site Re/code reported Tuesday, citing sources.Verizon viewed Huffington Post and the media brands as an attractive part of the AOL deal and has no immediate plans to sell them or spin them off, a source familiar with the matter said.Verizon was showing signs of desperation as its core wireless business comes under pressure, Macquarie Capital analysts wrote in a note.""We feel that Verizon paid a hefty price ... for what we believe to be an unproven programmatic ad-tech platform in the nascent video ad-tech space,"" they said.Verizon said it expects the deal, which includes about $300 million in AOL debt, to close this summer.LionTree Advisors, Weil Gotshal & Manges and Guggenheim Partners advised Verizon.

285,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 12 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Verizon Communications Inc.'s  (Verizon; NYSE: VZ) Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) and debt ratings following its  announcement that it has reached an agreement to purchase AOL Inc. (AOL) for $50  per share, or approximately $4.4 billion. The ratings have been affirmed as follows: Verizon Communications Inc. --Long-term IDR at 'A-'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A-'; --Senior unsecured revolving credit facility due 2018 and term loan due 2019 at  'A-'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial paper (CP) at 'F2'. Fitch has also assigned an 'A-' rating to the approximately $1.5 billion senior  unsecured term loan due 2016 (original amount $6.5 billion). The Rating Outlook is Stable. In addition, Fitch is maintaining the following issuers and their debt  securities on Rating Watch Negative due to their expected sale in 2016: Verizon California Verizon Florida --IDR 'A-'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A-'. GTE Southwest --IDR 'A-'; --First mortgage bonds 'A-'. Other subsidiary ratings were affirmed as shown at the end of this release. Verizon plans to purchase AOL via a tender offer followed by a merger, with the  purchase funded by cash on hand and commercial paper. AOL will become a  wholly-owned subsidiary of Verizon. The transaction is expected to close in  mid-2015, following the customary regulatory approvals. The ratings have been affirmed given the transaction's modest effect on  Verizon's credit metrics. Strategically, the acquisition of AOL and its  advertising platform and digital content will support Verizon's forthcoming  mobile video offerings. The purchase will complement investments Verizon has  made over the past few years in emerging digital media through Verizon Digital  Media Services. KEY RATING DRIVERS Verizon's ratings are supported by the strong competitive position of Verizon  Wireless (VZW), as evidenced by industry-low churn rates, high margins and the  most developed LTE network in the U.S. These factors are balanced against high  leverage for the rating, which stems from the February 2014 acquisition of the  remaining 45% stake in VZW. At March 31, 2015, last 12-months (LTM) gross  leverage was 2.6x. Net leverage was approximately 2.5x, and incorporated cash of  $4.4 billion at the end of the first quarter.   The recent acquisition of spectrum is expected to support VZW's competitive  position in the coming years. In the first quarter of 2015 (1Q15), Verizon used  cash and a $6.5 billion term loan to fund the remaining $9.5 billion owed for  the $10.4 billion in spectrum acquired in the Federal Communications  Commission's (FCC) AWS-3 auction. Most of the term loan was repaid from proceeds  received in the quarter from a $5 billion transaction with American Tower Corp.  whereby Verizon sold exclusive rights to lease and operate the majority of its  towers, and sold a small number of towers outright.  In 2016, Verizon expects to sell its wireline operations in California, Texas  and Florida to Frontier Communications Corp. for approximately $10.5 billion. In  total, these operations produce less than 5% and 4% of consolidated revenues and  EBITDA, respectively. Approximately $600 million of debt will travel with the  subsidiaries being sold. The net after-tax proceeds of $6.8 billion are expected  to be used to reduce debt. In February 2015, Verizon used a portion of its cash on hand to fund a $5  billion accelerated stock repurchase plan. As of the end of 1Q15, approximately  $4.25 billion of shares were delivered to Verizon, with the remainder expected  to be delivered in 2Q15. Verizon's liquidity is supported by its reported consolidated cash balances,  which were $4.4 billion at March 31, 2015, and by its revolving credit facility  (RCF). The $8 billion RCF matures in July 2018. Fitch expects Verizon to  maintain aggregate CP balances within a level fully backed by the RCF. The  credit facility has no ratings triggers or other restrictive financial  covenants, such as leverage or interest coverage tests. In March 2015, Verizon issued $13.4 billion of senior unsecured exchange notes  due 2036, 2048 and 2055 for existing senior unsecured debt of about $10.4  billion that it had previously issued. The exchange reduced significant maturity  towers in 2023 and 2043 (the tower in each year exceeded $10 billion) as well as  lowered the average cost of debt. On a consolidated basis, as of March 31, 2015, Verizon and its subsidiaries had  expected maturities of approximately $1.7 billion for the remainder of 2015, and  $7.2 billion in 2016. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Fitch assumes Verizon revenues grow in the mid-single-digit range over the  near term, excluding the effect of the asset sales, and that margins are  relatively stable in the mid-30% range. --Debt reduction, combined with EBITDA growth, is expected to reduce leverage to  a level appropriate for the rating in the 2016/2017 timeframe due to Verizon's  strong position in the wireless industry and the significant cash flows  generated by the wireless business.  --VZW will continue to generate strong free cash flow (FCF). VZW's simple FCF  (EBITDA less capital spending) for the LTM ended March 31, 2015 was  approximately $25.5 billion.  --In 2015, Fitch expects consolidated capital spending to be in line with  company guidance of $17.5 billion to $18 billion, slightly higher than the $17.2  billion spent in 2014. Investment in the wireless network continues to be an  area of emphasis due to the strong demand for 4G LTE capacity for rapidly  growing data services. --Potential spending in the FCC's 600 MHz TV broadcast auction, currently  anticipated to occur in early 2016, is not included in Fitch's assumptions and  will be an event-driven consideration. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch believes a positive rating action is unlikely in the foreseeable future,  given the leverage incurred in the Vodafone transaction. Conversely, Fitch may take negative rating action if operating performance  causes delevering to take place at a materially slower than anticipated pace,  either alone or in combination with material debt-financed acquisitions.  Discretionary management moves that cause leverage to rise above 2.5x, such as  another material acquisition or stock repurchases, could lead to a negative  action in the absence of a strong commitment to delever. Fitch has affirmed the following Verizon subsidiaries with a Stable Outlook: Cellco Partnership --IDR at 'A-'; --Senior unsecured debt (co-issued with Verizon Wireless Capital LLC) at 'A-'. Verizon Wireless Capital LLC --Senior unsecured debt (co-issued with Cellco Partnership) at 'A-'. Alltel Corp. GTE Corp. Verizon Delaware Verizon Maryland Verizon New England Verizon New Jersey Verizon New York Verizon Pennsylvania Verizon Virginia --IDR at 'A-'; --Senior unsecured at 'A-'.

287,"   By Malathi Nayak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Verizon Communications has made clear what it hopes to gain with the $4.4 billion purchase of AOL: a better way to sell mobile video ads.AOL, ridiculed for its continuing dial-up Internet business, has in the last few years assembled a set of cutting-edge online video technology tools to buy and sell ads automatically in real-time, measure audience metrics and specifically target users based on their preferences.Such ""programmatic"" buying is fast becoming the most effective way for online ads to be bought and sold.Verizon, meanwhile, has more than 100 million wireless customers and plans to launch a mobile video service that could be ad-supported. ""The principal interest was around the ad tech platform,"" John Stratton, president of operations at Verizon, said at an investors conference on Tuesday after the deal was announced. ""You have AOL and the mobile platform of Verizon,"" said M.S. Krishnan, a professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. ""They plan to marry the technology and the market space.""Verizon has significant data on its customers and their activity on devices that can be plugged into AOL's technology to target ads. AOL also competes with Google Inc and Facebook Inc in the business of managing and providing video ads for mobile and desktop website publishers. The Verizon data would allow it to improve targeting on behalf of those publishers as well.""Verizon can append data it has, and has authorization to use in an anonymized fashion, to a digital ad sale, and it will have better insight as to when to buy low and sell high,"" said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group said. AOL in 2004 bought advertising network Ad.com, which lets advertisers buy targeted ads across mobile devices and on the Web. Since then it has bought 5min Media, which owns videos that can be placed - along with ads - around the Web, video advertising platform Adap.tv, and Gravity, which tracks users’ interests to target them with relevant ads.With the deal, AOL and Verizon can jointly solve issues related to measurement of ad metrics and targeting, said MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett.Jefferies & Co analyst Mike McCormack said Verizon executives believe AOL can drive ""a significant improvement in ad dollars as they move into mobile video"". Revenue in AOL's ad platform business rose 21 percent to $279.8 million, accounting for 45 percent of total revenue in the first quarter ended March 31. U.S. digital advertising grew almost 18 percent in 2014, according to research firm eMarketer. AOL’s 2014 global advertising revenue was up 15 percent.Ads could be important for Verizon's plans for a new mobile Web video product - in March, Verizon CFO Fran Shammo told Reuters that the company may rely largely on advertising revenue for such a service launching this summer.Taking on the dominant advertising giants Google and Facebook, though, will not be easy. ""(Google) is the 800-pound gorilla,"" Pivotal Research's Wieser said.

298,"  (Adds details of AT&T and Verizon restrictions, and of Dish bidding and next year's auction, T-Mobile and Wheeler comments; byline)By Alina SelyukhWASHINGTON, June 25 The Federal Communications Commission is considering capping bidding discounts that small businesses can receive in U.S. auctions of airwaves, after Dish Network Corp partners sought $3 billion in discounts under current rules.FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler proposed the agency's first such cap on Thursday, and also dismissed T-Mobile US Inc's  request for new limits on how much spectrum dominant carriers Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc can buy in the next auction in 2016.The proposal, to be voted on at the July 16 meeting, is part of the FCC's preparation for next year's auction, expected to be its largest and most complex. Telecom companies will get their first chance since 2008 to buy low-frequency airwaves, highly prized for their ability to carry heavy data over long distances and through obstacles such as buildings.The FCC is expected to decide in coming days whether Dish abused the small-business discount program by investing in companies with little or no revenue that can receive a 25 percent discount as so-called ""designated entities."" These companies bid more than $13 billion in the so-called AWS-3 auction that ended in January and sought more than $3 billion in discounts.FCC senior officials on Thursday declined to comment on their review of the Dish partners' bids. Dish declined to comment.Wheeler's proposal would cap the discount for small businesses at $150 million and for rural service providers at $10 million for the 2016 auction. It also would prohibit joint bidding agreements that involve a shared bidding strategy and multiple auction applications by parties with common controlling interests, with certain exceptions. ""We will not allow small businesses to serve as a stalking horse for another party,"" Wheeler said in a blog post.The FCC has also been under pressure from T-Mobile to set aside more airwaves for smaller carriers like itself in next year's auction. The Department of Justice on Wednesday wrote to the FCC to ""give considerable weight"" to concerns that biggest wireless carriers may pay up extra to dominate the auction. The agency voted last year to restrict the participation of Verizon and AT&T in the 2016 spectrum sale by reserving a piece of each market's airwaves for non-dominant carriers, including T-Mobile and Sprint Corp as AT&T and Verizon already control the vast majority of low-frequency airwaves.T-Mobile had sought a bigger amount.""Everyone with a wireless phone has a stake in the outcome of this proceeding, and the FCC should heed the calls of DoJ, many in Congress and a slew of consumer groups and move to strengthen the reserve,"" Andy Levin, T-Mobile's senior vice president for government affairs, said in a statement.(Reporting by Alina Selyukh; Editing by Bill Trott and Richard Chang)",2015-06-25,VZ,"Thu Jun 25, 2015 | 3:31pm EDT",UPDATE 1-U.S. FCC may cap small-business discount in airwaves auctions,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-fcc-auction-idUSL1N0ZB1QI20150625?type=companyNews

303,"  (Adds details on industry price war)By Malathi Nayak and Devika  Krishna KumarJuly 21 Verizon Communications Inc on Tuesday lowered its full-year revenue target as it fends promotions from its competitors.Investors shrugged off higher-than-expected second-quarter earnings, which resulted mostly from a jump in tablet subscribers, and sent shares of the largest U.S. wireless service provider down as much as 3 percent.Smaller rivals such as T-Mobile US Inc have stirred up an industry price war, and wireless carriers have been offering heavy promotions and discounts on tablet and phone plans to keep or increase subscribers.The companies have replaced traditional two-year contracts of subsidized phones and tablets with monthly installment plans that have lower service fees.Customers shifted to the installment plans at a higher rate than Verizon had anticipated earlier in the year, resulting in a decline in service revenue, Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said in an interview. Verizon said it expected full-year revenue growth of at least 3 percent, below its previous forecast of 4 percent.Average revenue per user fell 3.8 percent to $153.73 in the quarter from a year earlier and missed the analysts' average forecast of $154.99, MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett said in a note.Despite pressure on revenue per user, ""Verizon's wireless margins remain the envy of the industry,"" Moffett said. Net income attributable to Verizon rose to $4.23 billion, or $1.04 per share, from $4.21 billion, or $1.02 per share. Analysts on average were expecting $1.01 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue increased to $32.22 billion from $31.48 billion, below analysts' estimates of $32.87 billion.Verizon added a net 1.1 million wireless retail postpaid subscribers, who pay each billing cycle based on usage. That met estimates from analysts polled by market research firm FactSet StreetAccount. Net tablet additions came to 852,000.Customer defections at Verizon's wireless postpaid business fell to a three-year low of 0.90 percent, while FactSet had expected 0.99 percent.Revenue from Verizon's FiOS high-speed Internet, TV and phone service rose 10 percent to $3.4 billion.After its $4.4 billion purchase of AOL Inc in June, Verizon is gearing up to introduce its online video service to generate new revenue from mobile video and targeted advertising.Verizon shares were down 1.9 percent at $47.20 on the New York Stock Exchange after trading as low as $46.57.

312,"   By Davide Scigliuzzo  NEW YORK, July 31 (IFR) - After a stellar start to 2015 the tide has turned against US high-yield issuers, leading to a breakdown in the primary market as investors have become far more sensitive to risk.Prime Healthcare shelved a US$700m eight-year bond deal this week, while renewable energy name TerraForm Global raised its yield on a US$800m seven-year by some 300bp during bookbuild.These were extreme outcomes in what had been a red-hot market that many saw as a by-product of contagion fears from the sharp sell-off in commodity-related debt.Others thought investors were trying to leverage the recent volatility into a demand for way more yield than was warranted.But whatever the reason, the brakes are on the junk-rated primary market - and bankers see only liquid deals from top-name borrowers likely to brave issuance in the weeks ahead.July saw just some US$8bn of high-yield bonds price.That is less than half of the US$20bn-plus monthly volumes seen in the first half of the year.The difficulties began with a drop in oil prices that sent energy bond spreads almost 200bp wider in July to Treasuries plus 908bp, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data. ""When you have a period of volatility and you have different bonds trading at significant discount to face value, it is always more difficult to look at the new issues coming at par,"" said David Cole, a high-yield portfolio manager at MFS Investment Management.Companies in energy, metals and mining may have borne the brunt of the beating, but other sectors have weakened as well.The telecoms component of BAML's main high-yield index saw its average spread touch a two-and-a half year wide of 508bp on Monday.""The stress has yet to make a meaningful impact to non-commodity sectors, but we view this lack of movement not as a positive, but just delay of the inevitable,"" BAML analysts said in a note on Thursday.Poor liquidity in the hardest-hit sectors could see fund managers selling whatever they can if they are facing loads of redemptions. ""In some cases (this) means trimming exposure to good credits and sectors just because that's where it's possible to find buyers,"" said Wesley Sparks, head of US credit strategies at Schroders.WAITING GAME In theory, many in the market say, conditions for borrowers remain constructive despite the recent hiccups. Some say Prime Healthcare's troubles were credit-specific, and that Alliant was seen as a victim of unfortunate timing when the insurer had to hike its pricing levels by 50bp to raise US$535m in an acquisition-related issue.""I don't think there is an issue with the market fundamentals,"" said Timothy Donahue, head of high yield and leveraged loan capital markets at JP Morgan.But for now, bankers are advising opportunistic borrowers to stand down, and warning others that they may have to pay up to triple-digit premiums in the next few weeks.And the pipeline for August is bare - at least in terms of what has been announced.Charter Communications is expected to sell the high-yield portion of a debt package to finance its acquisition of Time Warner Cable.The bond is expected to be up to US$3.5bn, and investors are now waiting to see if the company will brave the market soon after its quarterly results on August 4.Frontier Communications is also expected to bring a multi-billion high-yield bond to market that it needs to sell to help finance its acquisition of assets from Verizon Communications.Market participants believe Frontier is likely to wait until after the US Labor Day in September in order to avoid paying up in the current environment.

315,"   By Malathi Nayak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Aug 2 Verizon Communications Inc  and the unions representing its wireline unit employees on the U.S. East Coast said work will go on and talks continue after their current contract expired.Since June, the unions have been in talks with Verizon over the company's plans to cut costs by controlling healthcare and pension-related benefits over a three-year period.Last week, the Communications Workers of America (CWA) and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers that represent over 37,000 wireline employees said they had voted to go on strike, if needed, after their contract expired on Aug. 1 at midnight. During the last round of contract negotiations in 2011, talks ended in a strike. The unions want extra benefits in addition to job security provisions. The CWA said on Saturday that Verizon has not budged from its original proposal which they have said would increase workers' healthcare costs by thousands of dollars, eliminate job security and remove any restrictions on the company's right to contract out or offshore union jobs.""Despite our best efforts, Verizon refuses to engage in serious bargaining towards a fair contract,"" Dennis Trainor, Vice President for CWA District One, which represents Verizon workers in New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts, said.  ""We're not going to take it, and we're going to keep the fight going while we're on the job."" Verizon presented the unions with a revised proposal on Saturday night that is on the table, the company said in a statement.

319,"  (Adds T-Mobile CEO comments)By Alina SelyukhWASHINGTON Aug 6 The U.S. Federal Communications Commission on Thursday denied T-Mobile US Inc's  request that more airwaves be set aside for smaller wireless companies like itself to bid on during a government auction next year.The unanimous vote by the five-member commission came after months of T-Mobile's lobbying for stricter limits for AT&T Inc's  and Verizon Communications Inc's participation in the auction of prized low-frequency airwaves.Reuters previously reported that agency staff had found existing restrictions were sufficient to ensure that smaller carriers get a chance to outbid Verizon and AT&T, which dominate those low frequencies. The auction, tentatively slated to start in March, will be a landmark one for the U.S. wireless industry as it will give participants their first chance since 2008 to buy low-frequency airwaves, which are valued for their ability to carry heavy data over long distances and through obstacles such as buildings.The FCC voted last year to curb participation of carriers that held dominant slices of low-frequency airwaves in each market by reserving a piece of spectrum for bidding only by non-dominant carriers, but not to the extent T-Mobile sought. The vote was something of a compromise among the FCC's Democrats, who wanted to give smaller carriers a leg up while ensuring that restrictions on the big carriers would not cut the proceeds of the auction, expected to be the agency's largest.T-Mobile Chief Executive Officer John Legere on Twitter played down the policy loss, touting the existence of the reserved spectrum in the first place. ""Good news - the reserve includes great quality spectrum & looks like the FCC will be monitoring closely so duopoly can't game the system,"" Legere tweeted, referring to the top two U.S. carriers, Verizon and AT&T.He said T-Mobile was committed to ""showing up, playing hard and being successful at the auction.""T-Mobile shares were down 1.2 percent at $40.24 in afternoon trading, while Verizon dipped 0.6 percent and AT&T fell 1.6 percent.

324,"   By Malathi Nayak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Verizon Communications Inc will launch a trial version of its new mobile video service on Tuesday, aiming to prove that telecom players can compete with mobile ad industry titans Google Inc and Facebook Inc.Verizon said its service, a mobile app dubbed ""go90"", will be offered initially to a select set of its own customers, with advertisements from well-known brands, which it declined to name, but without newly acquired ad technology from AOL, the media company it bought in June for $4.4 billion.Verizon is targeting young viewers or millennials with about 100 to 200 hours of exclusive content from online video networks such as AwesomenessTV and Machinima, said Brian Angiolet, Verizon's senior vice president, consumer products. The free service will drive revenue from data usage and targeted advertising. Verizon's best chance to prove its advertising potential rests on technology from AOL, which has built tools to deliver targeted Web and mobile ads. That, combined with Verizon's customer data, should improve targeting, analysts say. The AOL technology is in the process of being integrated with Verizon's video service, and targeted advertising tools will be available over time, Angiolet said.  The service will launch officially to all users as soon as later this month, a Verizon spokesman said.     Companies from Netflix Inc to Dish Network Corp  already offer Web-based video services through subscriptions, but the No. 1 U.S. wireless company's ad-supported, short-form video model is unusual.Go90 pits Verizon against Internet advertising industry heavyweights Google and Facebook, and advertisers will take a ""wait and see"" approach to determine how many viewers Verizon captures, telecom industry consultant Tim Farrar said. ""Pretty much without exception telecom operators have not been successful as third parties in exploiting the Internet access service, whether it's video or anything else,"" Farrar said. ""What percentage of people’s app viewing is going to be over a Verizon app versus YouTube or Facebook...That’s the biggest uncertainty.""Verizon's rival AT&T Inc has said it has mobile video services targeting young viewers in the works.

326,"   By Malathi Nayak | LAS VEGAS  LAS VEGAS If Verizon's new mobile video service go90 succeeds in grabbing the attention of millenials who increasingly watch content on mobile devices, a streaming option for TVs could be next.Verizon Communications Inc, the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier, launched a trial of its free, ad-supported mobile video product, an app that offers live events, on-demand shows and Web videos, on Tuesday. Companies such as Netflix Inc and Hulu that offer Web-based video services have put pressure on traditional pay-TV companies that are struggling to add viewers.With go90, Verizon, which also offers a separate pay-TV service through its FiOS unit, has taken a different approach by introducing an ad-supported, short-form mobile video service. ""We said, Let's start with a mobile-first product,"" Marni Walden, Verizon's president of product innovation and new businesses, told Reuters on Thursday. ""The thought is that there could be a companion product that would come at some point in the future that could be in-home"" for TVs.    Verizon wanted to leverage its mobile network to stand out in a crowded streaming video market, Walden said.Dish Network Corp and Sony Corp also offer online video services. On Wednesday, Apple Inc announced an improved version of its set-top box, Apple TV, without details on new content agreements.""Our focus is all on our mobile product today,"" Walden said. ""We have to be successful with this product first and then we would have the right to say, 'Yes, let's go do the companion.'""    Go90 was developed from OnCue video streaming technology, which Verizon purchased from Intel Corp in 2014.  ""We don't believe trying to replace linear TV is the right thing,"" Walden said. ""We don't think the initial model we saw in Intel Media with $80 broadband and $80 content was one we could win at, particularly with all of the clutter and noise in that same space.""Go90's content partners include the National Football League, VH1, the Food Network and ESPN. From the Web, it will offer videos from Maker Studios, Machinima and AwesomenessTV, among others.  Verizon is also considering letting users create content in the future, Walden said.Go90 will use Verizon's multicast video technology that streams live events to multiple mobile devices through a single lane of airwaves.Moving forward, Verizon aspires to relay events to a global audience, although that would require negotiating streaming rights, Walden said.

327,"   By Devika  Krishna Kumar | Sept 11  Sept 11 Want to own the new iPhone without burning a hole in your pocket every month? Sprint seems to be the cheapest option in the United States.Sprint Corp's offer for the 16 GB iPhone 6S with a basic data, calling and text plan costs between $3 and $10.50 less per month than a competing offer from the other three top U.S. carriers.The competition in the U.S. wireless industry is fierce and the launch of the newest iPhone iteration on Wednesday is a chance for carriers to lure customers away from their rivals.But, Apple Inc served up a curve ball by offering its own financing scheme for an unlocked iPhone, which gives a customer the liberty to switch between carriers, rather than be tied down by a contract with one carrier.However, Sprint's plan works out to be cheaper, on a per month basis, than even buying the iPhone from Apple and going for the cheapest wireless plan on offer.Sprint is charging $22 per month for the 16 GB iPhone 6S, under a 21-month lease. That along with a basic talk, text and data plan, worth $45, will cost a customer $67 per month. A T-Mobile US Inc plan similar to Sprint's will cost about $70 per month - $20 for the phone with an 18-month agreement and $50 for a basic wireless plan.Sprint and T-Mobile usually offer cheaper plans to lure customers from Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc , the top two U.S. wireless companies, which analysts say have better networks.Verizon's plan costs about $77.08 per month, $27.08 for the iPhone over two years and $50 for a wireless plan. AT&T's plan, Next12, costs about $77.50 per month, $32.50 for a 20-month phone contract and $45 for a wireless plan.Under Apple's offer, the iPhone 6S will cost $32.41 per month. Paired with a basic $45 wireless plan, among the cheapest available, the phone would cost $77.41 per month.And what when a new iPhone is launched? Sprint allows users to upgrade every time a new iPhone is launched, which typically happens once every year, and charges an activation fee.T-Mobile allows a free upgrade at any time, while AT&T offers the option of a free upgrade after 12 months.Verizon's plan also permits an upgrade at any time, but requires customers to pay off the remaining cost of the iPhone.Still, there are advantages in opting for Apple's financing plan.Apple's scheme includes AppleCare+, a warranty program that provides two years of hardware protection, instead of the standard one year, as well as coverage for two incidents in cases of accidental damage.

328,"  NEW YORK Verizon Communications Inc announced on Thursday it would begin to offer roaming wireless service in Cuba next week, becoming the first U.S. company to do so.The announcement by the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier follows the restoration of diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States in July after 54 years.The United States has set connectivity as a priority in its new relationship with the communist-run island.The news came on the same day Cuba said its first ambassador to the United States since 1961 had presented his credentials at the White House. Telecommunications equipment, technology and services were among the first exemptions to a U.S. economic embargo of the island after Washington and Havana announced plans to restore diplomatic relations in December.Verizon will charge $2.99 per minute for voice calls and $2.05 per megabyte for data, making the option an expensive one. Currently, visiting Americans must purchase a pay-as-you-go cell phone through state telephone company Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Cuba SA (ETECSA) to have cellular service on the island, or have a cellphone account in a third country. ETECSA does not offer data. Boost Mobile, part of Sprint Corp, in April launched a prepaid plan for U.S. consumers calling and texting Cuba. In March, U.S.-based IDT Corp reached an agreement with ETECSA to provide direct international long-distance service.

329,"  (Adds link to story on Cuba's ambassador)NEW YORK, Sept 17 Verizon Communications Inc  announced on Thursday it would begin to offer roaming wireless service in Cuba next week, becoming the first U.S. company to do so.The announcement by the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier follows the restoration of diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States in July after 54 years.The United States has set connectivity as a priority in its new relationship with the communist-run island. The news came on the same day Cuba said its first ambassador to the United States since 1961 had presented his credentials at the White House. [IDn:L1N11N2NN] Telecommunications equipment, technology and services were among the first exemptions to a U.S. economic embargo of the island after Washington and Havana announced plans to restore diplomatic relations in December.Verizon will charge $2.99 per minute for voice calls and $2.05 per megabyte for data, making the option an expensive one. Currently, visiting Americans must purchase a pay-as-you-go cell phone through state telephone company Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Cuba SA (ETECSA) to have cellular service on the island, or have a cellphone account in a third country. ETECSA does not offer data. Boost Mobile, part of Sprint Corp, in April launched a prepaid plan for U.S. consumers calling and texting Cuba. In March, U.S.-based IDT Corp reached an agreement with ETECSA to provide direct international long-distance service.

342,"  (Adds Verizon quote)By Sarah N. LynchOct 26 New York state's attorney general is probing whether three major Internet providers could be shortchanging consumers by charging them for faster broadband speeds and failing to deliver the speeds being advertised, according to documents seen by Reuters.The letters, sent on Friday to executives at Verizon Communications Inc, Cablevision Systems Corp and Time Warner Cable Inc, ask each company to provide copies of all disclosures they have made to customers, as well as copies of any testing they may have done of their Internet speeds.""New Yorkers deserve the Internet speeds they pay for. But, it turns out, many of us may be paying for one thing, and getting another,"" Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement.In statements, spokesmen for the three companies expressed confidence in the speeds of their Internet services. ""We're confident that we provide our customers the speeds and services we promise them and look forward to working with the AG to resolve this matter,"" Time Warner Cable spokesman Bobby Amirshahi said.Cablevision spokesman Charlie Schueler said the company's Optimum Online service ""consistently surpasses advertised broadband speeds, including in FCC (Federal Communications Commission) and internal tests. We are happy to provide any necessary performance information to the Attorney General as we do to our customers."" A Verizon spokesman said the company would cooperate with Schneiderman's office. ""Verizon is confident in the robust and reliable Internet speeds it delivers to subscribers,"" the spokesman said.The attorney general's investigation is particularly focused on so-called interconnection arrangements, or contractual deals that Internet service providers strike with other networks for the mutual exchange of data.In the letters, Schneiderman's office says it is concerned that customers paying a premium for higher speeds may be experiencing a disruption in their service due to technical problems and business disputes over interconnection agreements. A 2014 study by the Measurement Lab Consortium, or M-Lab, found that customers' Internet service tended to suffer at points where their broadband providers connected with long-haul Internet traffic carriers, including Cogent Communications Group Inc.""Internet service provider interconnection has a substantial impact on consumer Internet performance - sometimes a severely negative impact,"" the study said, adding that business relationships rather than technical issues were often at the root of the problem.A spokesman for the attorney general's office said the 2014 study's findings, coupled with consumer complaints and internal analysis, prompted the inquiry into Internet speeds.Some of the letters also raise questions about speeds delivered by Time Warner Cable and Cablevision to consumers over ""the last mile,"" a term that refers to the point where a telecommunication chain reaches a retail consumer's devices.

343,"   By Malathi Nayak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) is trying to pave the way for developers to connect more devices to the Web, as its ""Internet of Things"" business has touched $500 million so far this year, an executive said on Wednesday.Aimed at connecting to the Internet everything from household devices to industrial machines, the business is growing at a ""double-digit"" rate, Mike Lanman, senior vice president of enterprise products at Verizon said at an event in San Francisco. ""A large portion of our revenue comes through connectivity but a significant part of it comes from the application layer already,"" he said in a phone interview after introducing a platform to help customers develop applications in healthcare, agriculture, utilities and connected cars.Last year, Verizon's annual revenue from the business totaled $585 million. As the market for smartphones and mobile devices gets saturated, Verizon and its biggest rival AT&T Inc (T.N) are hoping that connecting more objects and appliances to their networks will provide an avenue for growth. The global Internet of Things market is expected to grow to $1.7 trillion in 2020 from $656 billion in 2014, according to market research firm IDC. Examples include Verizon's fleet management tracking application and a partnership with Intel Corp (INTC.O) to provide water management sensors in vineyards, Lanman said.At the event, Verizon also unveiled a chip that Lanman said halves the cost of connecting low data usage devices like dog trackers to high-speed networks.  AT&T has also been working on growing its ""Internet of Things"" business and previously launched initiatives such as a cloud-based data-analytics platform for companies and a global SIM card for connected cars. AT&T said last week it added 1.6 million connected devices including 1 million connected cars in the third quarter of 2015.

348,"   By Liana B. Baker and Greg Roumeliotis | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Verizon Communications Inc is exploring a sale of its enterprise assets which could be worth as much as $10 billion, according to people familiar with the matter, as the largest U.S. wireless carrier seeks to focus on its core business.The sale would include the business formerly known as MCI, which provides landline and Internet services for large business customers, as well as Terremark, its data center unit, the people said this week.The businesses have struggled to keep up with advances in cloud computing, and face fierce price competition from players such as Alphabet Inc and Amazon.com Inc.Verizon's enterprise assets might not be easy to separate and any potential buyer would likely have to sign commercial agreements with the company, some of the people said. Verizon is still considering how some of these asset sales could best be structured and no deal is imminent, the people added.Wireline provider CenturyLink Inc was in talks with Verizon earlier this year to buy some of the assets but could not agree on terms, the people said. In a strategy shift, CenturyLink announced this week it would instead explore options for some of its data centers, including possibly selling them. Citigroup Inc has been advising Verizon on the possible sale of the assets, which have estimated annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of around $2 billion, the people added.The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Verizon, CenturyLink and Citigroup declined to comment.The enterprise telecommunications industry has had to adapt in recent years to corporate customers seeking more sophisticated and cheaper offerings to manage their data.  AT&T Inc has been exploring a sale of its data center assets for some time, while Windstream Holdings Inc sold its data center business for $575 million to TierPoint last month.Verizon Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said, during the company's third-quarter earnings call on Oct. 20, that it continues ""to work through secular and economic challenges"" with its global enterprise division, which posted a 4.9 percent decline in revenue in the quarter ended Sept. 30. Verizon's $8.4 billion acquisition of MCI was completed in 2006 following a fierce bidding war with Qwest Communications, which is now part of CenturyLink. It acquired Terremark Worldwide Inc in 2011 for $1.4 billion. Verizon has been looking to sell other non-core assets as well. In February, it announced the sale of residential landline assets to Frontier Communications for $10.54 billion, and unloaded its tower portfolio for more than $5 billion.(Corrects paragraph three to face instead of faces) (Reporting by Liana B.

Baker  Plans by Yahoo Inc's (YHOO.O) board to consider selling its struggling Internet business sent the company's shares up more than 5 percent on Wednesday, as investors cheered a potential new way to separate Yahoo's traditional services from its valuable investment in Chinese Web merchant Alibaba.Yahoo's board will weigh a sale of the Internet business at a three-day board meeting starting on Wednesday, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday.Chief Executive Marissa Mayer's attempts to revive the traditional business have born little fruit, and almost all of Yahoo's market capitalization of about $34 billion is ascribed to its stakes in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Holding Group Ltd (BABA.N) and Yahoo Japan Corp (4689.T).A separate Alibaba stake would be expected to be more highly valued by the market, but investors want to avoid a massive tax bill in the process. Selling the traditional business is seen as one way possibly to achieve that.Broken out as a separate company, Yahoo's email, Yahoo and Tumblr web sites and mobile services could fetch between $2 billion and $8 billion, analysts and bankers said, many seeing $4 billion as the likely price.If Yahoo sells off its traditional web business all that would be left, essentially, is the Alibaba and Yahoo Japan stakes.

IAC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Journal, which first reported that Yahoo might sell its Internet business, also reported on Tuesday that the board meeting would discuss how to proceed with the spinoff of the company's 15 percent stake in Alibaba, worth more than $30 billion if held separately.  Yahoo's Internet business has been struggling to boost revenue from ad sales in the face of stiff competition from Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google and Facebook (FB.O).According to a person familiar with the matter, activist investor Starboard Value LP is also disappointed in Yahoo’s performance under Mayer and has lost confidence in the CEO. Starboard attributes the relatively low price of the Internet business to poor management of the division by Mayer and the Yahoo management team.

Todd and Anya George TharakanDec 2 Plans by Yahoo Inc's board to consider selling its struggling Internet business sent the company's shares up nearly 6 percent on Wednesday, as investors cheered a potential new way to separate Yahoo's traditional services from its valuable investment in Chinese Web merchant Alibaba.Yahoo's board is weighing the sale of the Internet business at a three-day board meeting starting on Wednesday, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. The board did not reach a decision on Wednesday and will continue discussions on Thursday, CNBC reported.Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer's attempts to revive the traditional business have born little fruit, and almost all of Yahoo's market capitalization of about $34 billion is ascribed to its stakes in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Holding Group Ltd and Yahoo Japan Corp.A separate Alibaba stake would be expected to be more highly valued by the market, but investors want to avoid a massive tax bill in the process. Selling the traditional business is seen as one way possibly to achieve that.Broken out as a separate company, Yahoo's email, Yahoo and Tumblr web sites and mobile services could fetch between $2 billion and $8 billion, analysts and bankers said, many seeing $4 billion as the likely price.After such a sale, all that would be left, essentially, is the Alibaba and Yahoo Japan stakes.""Realizing value is far from assured, however,"" Pivotal analyst Brian Wieser wrote in a note. ""The big question is whether anyone would actually show up with a meaningful bid."" Interested bidders could range from private equity companies attracted to Yahoo's still-huge base of customers to technology companies eager for Yahoo's mobile and web content, following the model of Verizon Communications Inc buying AOL.The Wall Street Journal said potential bidders could include Verizon and IAC/InterActiveCorp. A source familiar with Verizon's thinking said currently there were no talks between the companies. IAC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Journal, which first reported that Yahoo might sell its Internet business, also reported on Tuesday that the board meeting would discuss how to proceed with the spinoff of the company's 15 percent stake in Alibaba, worth more than $30 billion if held separately.Yahoo's Internet business has been struggling to boost revenue from ad sales in the face of stiff competition from Alphabet Inc's Google and Facebook Inc. While Yahoo's share price has more than doubled and widely outperformed the broader stock market since Mayer took over as president and CEO in July 2012, much of the long upward trajectory was funded by an aggressive share buyback program and its stakes in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan.Mayer's engineering background served her well in research and development, said Martin Pyykkonen, managing director of Internet, media and entertainment equity research with Rosenblatt Securities Inc.But she did not woo advertisers well: in 2014 she overslept and left top advertisers waiting two hours at the industry's biggest gala, Cannes Lions in France, for instance.""These things don't get forgotten easily,"" Pyykkonen said. ""She came in three and a half years ago to a company that wasn't growing and it's still not growing today."" According to a person familiar with the matter, activist investor Starboard Value LP is also disappointed in Yahoo's performance under Mayer and has lost confidence in the CEO. Starboard attributes the relatively low price of the Internet business to poor management of the division by Mayer and the Yahoo management team.The company's emerging businesses, which Mayer calls Mavens - mobile, video, native and social advertising - have been the bright spot for the company.""To me that would be most valuable to sell,"" said Ivan Feinseth, an analyst at Tigress Financial Partners.""I think private equity would be interested in the Mavens businesses,"" he said.Starboard asked Yahoo in November to drop plans to spin off its stake in Alibaba due to the tax concerns, and urged the company to sell its core search and display advertising businesses instead.Yahoo shares closed up 5.8 percent at $35.65 on Nasdaq.(Additional reporting by Supantha Mukherjee, Liana Baker and Malathi Nayak; writing by Peter Henderson; Editing by Ted Kerr, Bernard Orr and Lisa Shumaker)",2015-12-03,VZ,"Wed Dec 2, 2015 | 8:46pm EST",UPDATE 4-Yahoo shares rise as board meets and considers sale of Web business,http://www.reuters.com//article/yahoo-divestiture-idUSL3N13R4IB20151203?type=companyNews
357,"   By David Shepardson | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON A U.S. appeals court heard arguments on Friday over the legality of the Federal Communications Commission's net neutrality rules, in a case that may ultimately determine how consumers get access to content on the Internet.The fight is the latest battle over Obama administration rules requiring broadband providers to treat all data equally, rather than giving or selling access to a so-called Web ""fast lane.""A three-judge panel, in a hearing that lasted over three hours, questioned lawyers for the FCC and broadband backers about whether the FCC properly extended the sweeping authority it has to regulate telecommunications to Internet service providers.So-called net neutrality is a major issue for broadband providers like Verizon Communications Inc and Comcast Corp, which fear the rules may make it harder to manage Internet traffic and make investment to provide additional capacity less likely. It is also a big concern for content providers like Netflix Inc and Yelp Inc, worried that access to customers could be limited without net neutrality.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has ruled twice against the FCC since 2010 and Judge David Tatel, who wrote both opinions, is on the panel that heard the case. The issue, Tatel said, is whether the FCC had authority to reclassify the Internet as a more heavy-regulated telecommunications service rather than an information service.Lawyers for the Internet service providers argued that because they exercise some control over functions like cached pages they met the burden as an information service provider, which would limit how extensively the FCC could impose net neutrality rules.But the FCC said broadband providers were acting merely to transport data, not making content decisions. An open Internet spurs innovation and helps improve broadband infrastructure, the FCC argued, saying network companies plowed $230 billion into the Web over 2011-2013, when open Internet rules were in effect.Judge Tatel wrote the majority opinion in 2010 ruling against the FCC after it cited Comcast for slowing Internet traffic speeds to some customers who were downloading very large data files from peer-to-peer networks.The FCC then issued new rules that blocked broadband providers from slowing or discriminating against Internet traffic and Tatel wrote the opinion that blocked those rules in 2014.

359,"   By David Shepardson | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Dec 4 A three-judge U.S. appeals court panel on Friday will consider whether the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) net neutrality rules are legal, hearing arguments from major cable and telecommunications trade associations and AT&T Inc.The fight is the latest challenge to Obama administration rules requiring broadband providers to treat all data equally, rather than giving or selling access to a Web fast lane.Such so-called net neutrality is a major issue for broadband providers like Verizon Communications Inc, Comcast Corp  and others who fear the rules may make it harder to manage Internet traffic and make it less likely providers will invest to provide additional capacity.

He is joined by judges appointed by presidents Barack Obama and Ronald Reagan.They will consider FCC rules set in February that bar ""blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization"" by broadband providers. An open Internet spurs innovation and helps improve broadband infrastructure, the FCC argued, saying network companies ploughed $230 billion into the Web over 2011-2013, when open Internet rules were in effect.But supporters of broadband providers in a legal brief called the rules ""a naked effort by the agency to achieve its desired result."" The FCC has classified the Internet as a utility, but broadband providers argue regulators ""can't interpret the term 'land vehicles' to include 'boats.'"" Legal experts are divided about how the court may rule.Former FCC Commissioner Robert McDowell, who served from 2006-2013, said the FCC ""overreached"" and argued the court was ""highly likely"" to overturn the FCC decision.Cardozo law professor Michael Burstein, who filed briefs in support of the FCC, said the case won't hinge on whether net neutrality is a good or bad idea but on whether the agency had the authority to make the rules and if they violate the First Amendment. Judge Tatel wrote the majority opinion in 2010 ruling against the FCC after it cited Comcast for slowing Internet traffic speeds to some customers who were downloading very large data files from peer-to-peer networks.The FCC then issued new rules that blocked broadband providers from slowing or discriminating against Internet traffic and Tatel wrote the opinion that blocked those rules in 2014.Congress has considered writing its own rules on net neutrality but hasn't voted on any proposals.

AT&T Inc (T.N) has been exploring a sale of its data center assets since last year, while CenturyLink announced in November 2015 that it was exploring strategic alternatives for its data centers. Windstream Holdings Inc (WIN.O) also sold its data center business for $575 million to TierPoint last year. Verizon has been facing stiff competition from companies such as T-Mobile US Inc TMUS.N and Sprint Corp (S.N), which have been offering deep discounts on cellphone and data plans.

373,"   By Malathi Nayak and Kshitiz Goliya  Verizon Communications Inc on Thursday reported higher-than-expected revenue for the fourth quarter as heavy promotions helped it counter aggressive offers and discounts from rivals and win new users.Shares of the No. 1 U.S. wireless phone service provider, whose profit edged past analysts' estimates, rose 2.7 percent to $45.63 in morning trading. Verizon added a net 1.5 million wireless retail postpaid, or monthly, subscriptions in the quarter, below 2 million a year earlier but above the analysts' average estimate of 1.42 million, according to market research firm FactSet StreetAccount.The company, known for its high-quality network, withstood stiff competition from rivals in the saturated U.S. wireless market. Smaller rival Sprint Corp offered 50 percent off to encourage users to switch to its network, and T-Mobile US Inc launched a free video streaming plan.For its part, Verizon rolled out holiday season offers such as a data giveaway on some plans, $100 discounts on certain phones and a $300 credit to trade in some models. Customer defections, or churn, in Verizon's postpaid business fell to 0.96 percent from 1.14 percent a year earlier.  Average revenue per account, however, fell 6.6 percent to $148.30, below the analysts' forecast of $149.61, according to FactSet. Jefferies analyst Mike McCormack said Verizon must curb such declines in this measure this year.Like its rivals, Verizon has switched from offering customers two-year contracts to monthly installment plans that have lower service fees and can weigh on revenue. To increase revenue, Verizon is investing in its new ""go90"" mobile-video service and ""Internet of Things,"" which connects everything from industrial machines to household devices to the Internet. Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said in an interview that the company still expected full-year earnings growth, excluding special items, to be on ""a flatter plateau"" in 2016 than 2015 as a result of those investments and the shift to the installment model.

378,"   By David Shepardson | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday proposed competition in the pay television set-top box market, a move that could let consumers swap costly cable industry boxes for cheaper service through devices like tablets.FCC chairman Tom Wheeler unveiled the proposed regulation later to let customers get video services from providers like Alphabet Inc, Tivo and Apple instead of cable, satellite and other television providers like Comcast, Verizon and Dish, according to the proposal, which will be voted on Feb. 18.The FCC says Americans spent $20 billion a year to lease pay-TV boxes, or an average of $231 a year. The summary said set-top box rental fees have jumped 185 percent since 1994, while the cost of TVs, computers and mobile phones have dropped by 90 percent.A coalition of existing pay-TV providers oppose competition in the set-top box market and on Wednesday said it would not provide new programming to customers or lower their television bills.The FCC said consumers should be allowed to get cable, satellite or other pay-TV through an app or through devices like a smart TV or tablet instead of only a set-top box.  ""The only change the FCC is proposing is to allow consumers alternative means of accessing the content they pay for,"" the summary says.Wheeler compared set-top boxes to Americans being forced to rent rotary dial telephones for decades. ""The FCC unlocked competition and empowered consumers with a simple but powerful rule - consumers could connect the telephones and modems of their choice to the telephone network,"" Wheeler said in an op-ed.  In 2007, the FCC opened wireless networks to non-carrier-provided devices.The FCC's goal is to allow consumers to have a user friendly interface that integrates ""pay TV and streaming content on one device.""In November, a group of eight Democratic senators including presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Al Franken, Cory Booker and Ed Markey, wrote to the FCC urging opening the set-top boxes to competition. ""The FCC is finally on its way to fulfilling the promise to American consumers of a competitive and robust video box market,"" Markey said Wednesday, praising the ""proposal to help ensure that consumers are not captive to bloated rental fees forever.""The FCC said a competitive marketplace is required by a 1996 law. Set-top boxes should be open to pay-TV rivals using formats that conform ""to specifications set by an independent, open standards body,"" the FCC said.

385,"   By Malathi Nayak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Feb 19 Verizon Communications Inc , which launched its pay TV plan ""FiOS Custom TV"" last year to let viewers choose bundles of channels they want to watch, has redesigned the offering.The revamped Custom TV now offers a choice of one of two packages with over 100 channels and three optional genre-specific packs instead of a slim base offering of 36 channels plus numerous genre-specific add-ons.The move to expand the offering was not in response to objections from content partners but based on customer feedback, a Verizon spokesman said.The first package called ""Essentials"" has over 190 channels, including the big four U.S. networks Disney's ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC. The package also includes Discovery Channel and AMC with no sports offerings. The second package ""Sports & more"" has over 160 channels, including ESPN and regional sports, plus non-sports channels, such as Cartoon Network. In April last year, Verizon repackaged the traditional pay-TV bundle and created a stir with some programmers by moving channels traditionally prevalent in pay-TV base packages such as ESPN, a unit of Walt Disney Co and Comcast Corp  division NBC Universal's USA out of a base tier into optional genre-specific add-on packs such as sports and entertainment.ESPN has sued Verizon alleging a breach of contract, while Twenty-First Century Fox and NBC Universal have said that the Custom TV offering violates their contractual obligations. The offering now costs $69.99, along with FiOS Internet and digital voice services and offers three genre-specific add-on packages with movie, family and global sports channels for $6 each. The first Custom TV iteration started at $65 a month for broadband service, 36 fixed basic channels and two genre-based channel packs, from a choice of seven for $10 each.The growing popularity of online video services such as Netflix Inc has put pressure on pay TV providers to innovate. Last month, Verizon's chief financial officer Fran Shammo declined to comment on the ESPN lawsuit on an earnings call with investors but said that customers ""don't want to have to pay for bundles that they never use.""""We will refresh (Custom TV) here in the short term to be in compliance with the contractual arrangements,"" he added.Compared to pay-TV giants AT&T Inc with its DirecTV acquisition last year and Comcast, FiOS has a small market in 12 states and Washington, D.C.

390,"   By Malathi Nayak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Verizon Communications Inc, which launched its pay TV plan ""Fios Custom TV"" last year to let viewers choose bundles of channels they want to watch, has redesigned the offering.The revamped Custom TV now offers a choice of one of two packages with over 100 channels and three optional genre-specific packs, instead of a slim offering of 36 channels plus numerous genre-specific add-ons.  The move was not in response to objections from content partners but based on customer feedback, a Verizon spokesman said.  The first package, named ""Essentials,"" has over 190 channels, including the big four U.S. networks - Disney's ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC with no sports offerings. The second package, ""Sports & more,"" has more than 160 channels, including ESPN and regional sports, plus non-sports channels such as the Cartoon Network.In April last year, Verizon repackaged the traditional pay-TV bundle and created a stir with some programmers by moving some traditional pay TV base-tier channels into optional genre-specific add-on packs. The channels it moved included ESPN, a unit of Walt Disney Co and Comcast Corp division NBC Universal's USA. ESPN has sued Verizon, alleging a breach of contract, while Twenty-First Century Fox and NBC Universal have said the Custom TV offering violates their contractual obligations. ESPN is ""encouraged by the changes that Verizon has made to Custom TV,"" spokeswoman Katina Arnold said. She declined to comment on ESPN's lawsuit against Verizon.      FOX and NBC could not be reached immediately for comment. The offering now costs $69.99, along with Fios Internet and digital voice services and three genre-specific add-on packages for $6 each. The first Custom TV iteration started at $65 a month for broadband, 36 fixed basic channels and two genre-based channel packs, from a choice of seven for $10 each.The growing popularity of online video services such as Netflix Inc has put pressure on pay TV providers to innovate.  Last month, Verizon's Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo declined to comment on the ESPN lawsuit on an earnings call with investors, but said customers ""don't want to have to pay for bundles that they never use.""

392,"  (Corrects paragraph 1 to say AT&T thinks it has an advantage in 5G technology due to promises it made to expand Internet access related to its DIRECTV acquisition, instead of solely because of its DIRECTV acquisition)By Harro Ten WoldeBARCELONA Feb 22 Commitments AT&T Inc  made to build out fixed high-speed Internet services to gain regulatory approval for its $48.5 billion purchase of DIRECTV will give it the edge over U.S. rival Verizon in the roll-out of the next generation of cellular technology, AT&T's strategy chief said on Monday.So-called 5G wireless networks are expected to offer 1,000-fold gains in capacity over existing networks, giving the potential to connect at least 100 billion devices with download speeds that can reach 10 gigabits per second (Gb/s).To achieve that, wireless networks will need to be supported by existing fixed-line infrastructure. So DIRECTV's widespread fixed-line network will be a big boost for AT&T, Chief Strategy Officer John Donovan said in an interview at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.""We are in a better position because we have a fixed line proposition which is becoming much more interesting now with 5G,"" Donovan said. Verizon spokesman Jim Gerace said: ""AT&T has followed us in every turn of technology - wireless and wired - and they will again with 5G.""The global telecom industry will release official standards for 5G in 2018 but some players have begun planning test runs. AT&T said this month it planned to have trials of 5G technology by the end of this year, while Verizon said late last year it would kick off trials in 2016. Donovan also said AT&T would continue to oppose a proposal approved by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to let consumers swap pricey cable boxes for cheaper devices and apps.The move was aimed at boosting competition in the $20 billion television set-top box market, while delivering a blow to major cable companies.The FCC has opened up a discussion on the plan for the coming months.""We will continue to be very vocal in our opposition,"" Donovan said, adding AT&T would plea for a software oriented solution, which would mean customers could keep their set-top box, while allowing competition.

407,"   By Malathi Nayak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A quiet decision by private equity firm Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) to recently sell three TV stations may foreshadow uncertain returns for some selling TV airwaves and lower wireless demand in the U.S. government's upcoming spectrum auction, industry watchers say.The U.S. Federal Communications Commission's auction, which kicks off on March 29, will sell low-frequency airwaves held by TV broadcasters to wireless companies and other bidders.  Blackstone-controlled investment vehicle LocusPoint Networks LLC bought at least 16 stations from San Francisco to Miami, spending $66 million since 2012, according to FCC filings and data from research firm SNL Kagan. Other well-funded buyout firms such as OTA Broadcasting LLC backed by billionaire Michael Dell and NRJ TV LLC, funded by Fortress Investment Group, have also snatched up TV stations in the run-up to the auction.But in late November, shortly before the FCC began accepting applications from TV stations to sell spectrum, Blackstone's LocusPoint agreed to sell three stations in Baltimore, Detroit and Buffalo, New York, for about $24 million, according to FCC filings reviewed by Reuters. The deal closed late last month.That's five times the $4.8 million Blackstone paid, but just 5 percent of the government's $477 million stated opening bid prices for the three stations' spectrum licenses. Its acceptance of the deal for $24 million implies Blackstone lowered its expectations for the auction, even as the government's $477 million opening bid was not realistic,  analysts said. The FCC will first hold a ""reverse auction,"" gradually reducing its offer to the lowest amount participating TV broadcasters will accept. Wireless companies then bid for airwaves. ""There’s a general agreement among broadcasters that the opening bid prices that you see registered are high and that you won’t be getting that,"" said Dr. John MacKerron, professor at Towson University who manages student-run WMJF-CD in Towson, Maryland, one of the three sold to HME.Recon Analytics analyst Roger Entner forecasts the 2016 auction proceeds at $20 billion to the low $30 billion range. The FCC's ""AWS-3 auction"" that ended last year saw record  bids of $44.9 billion.""If it would be a massive success, (Blackstone) wouldn’t sell right now, right before (the auction),"" Enter said.  While spectrum in certain geographic areas around metropolitan areas is attractive, there is a glut in secondary markets, analysts said. Moreover, some of the biggest wireless bidders are still digesting their investments from the previous FCC auction that ended last year, they added. Blackstone sold to HME Equity Fund II, owned by U.S. President Barack Obama's 2012 campaign manager, Jim Messina, and retired National Basketball Association player Grant Hill, and others, according to filings. Blackstone declined to comment and a lawyer for HME did not respond to requests for comment.  The three stations sold are among those in Blackstone's portfolio with lowest opening bid prices. Stations that LocusPoint has retained in major markets such as San Francisco and Orlando say ""cha-ching,"" Entner said. If HME is unable to sell the licenses, ""they could sell (after the auction) for less than what LocusPoint paid for them,"" SNL Kagan analyst Justin Nielson said.OTA and NRJ have not sold stations ahead of the auction, he added.Top U.S. wireless carriers Verizon Communications Inc(VZ.N)  and AT&T Inc (T.N) , pay-TV providers Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Dish Corp (DISH.O) have filed to participate, but some analysts do not expect them to bid aggressively.

413,"   By David Shepardson | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Federal Communications Commission on Thursday advanced a proposal to ensure the privacy of broadband Internet users by barring providers from collecting user data without consent.The proposed regulation from FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler won initial approval with a 3-2 vote to require broadband providers to obtain consumer consent, disclose data collection, protect personal information and report breaches -- but would not bar any data collection practices.""It's the consumers' information and the consumer should have the right to determine how it's used,"" Wheeler said.Broadband providers currently collect consumer data without consent and some use that data for targeted advertising, which has drawn criticism from privacy advocates.Wheeler's proposal does not prohibit Internet providers from using or sharing customer data for any purpose. The FCC would not extend the broadband provider privacy rules to sites such as Twitter, Google or Facebook, drawing the ire of providers. Republican Commissioner Ajit Pai said Thursday there is no good reason to single out broadband providers for regulations, while not regulating websites. The plan ""favors one set of corporate interests over another,"" he said.The FCC has authority to set privacy rules after it reclassified broadband providers last year as part of new net neutrality regulations. A federal appeals court has not ruled on a challenge to that decision.A final vote on new regulations will follow a public comment period during which the FCC is asking for possible ""additional or alternative paths to achieve pro-consumer, pro-privacy goals."" Under the rules providers would need to tell consumers what information is being collected, how it is being used and when it will be shared.They would also be required protect data under a data security standard. Consumers would need to be notified of breaches of their data no later than 10 days after it was discovered. Ratings agency Moody's Investors Services said earlier the proposal to impose privacy restrictions on broadband providers such as Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp is ""credit negative.""Advocacy group Free Press praised the FCC for moving ahead and said the commission must consider other issues in setting rules including ""pay-for-privacy, deep-packet inspection, upselling services, competition and data security.""The National Cable and Telecommunications Association urged  the FCC to adopt a ""technology neutral approach by treating companies with access to similar user information the same.""

Unless Verizon reconsiders its stance on unsettled issues, wireline workers will stage the walkout starting at 6 a.m. EDT on Wednesday, CWA President Chris Shelton said on a media call.""Verizon has forced us there ... Nobody wants to go on strike,"" Shelton said. ""It's a hardship for our members and our families, it's a hardship for customers.""

Wireline workers have been working out of contract since the last agreement expired in August.   While a compromise on healthcare plans has been reached, dispute over offshoring call center jobs and pensions still remain, union representatives said. “We’ve tried to work with union leaders to reach a deal,” said Marc Reed, Verizon’s chief administrative officer, said in a company statement The company said it is fully prepared to serve its customers in the event of a strike.The last round of contract negotiations in 2011 also led to a strike.""We are available,"" said Verizon spokesman Rich Young, when asked about the outlook for negotiations.

In recent years, Verizon, the No. 1 U.S. wireless company, has shifted focus to the bread-and-butter wireless business and new efforts in mobile video and advertising.

428,"   By Reynolds Holding | NEW YORK  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Verizon Communications  workers are bolstering unions' cautious comeback. The telecom company's staff walked out in one of the largest U.S. strikes in years after contract talks stalled. Add a Supreme Court win, minimum-wage hikes and a big role in presidential races, and organized labor's future begins to look a bit brighter.Some 40,000 customer-services representatives, landline-phone technicians and others are picketing the company. That's not far off the total who downed tools in 12 significant U.S. strikes last year. Verizon's employees, who have not had a contract since August, are protesting planned cuts in healthcare and pension-related benefits over three years.Prospects for success are uncertain, of course. A 2011 Verizon strike resulted in a new contract after two weeks. The size of the current stoppage, though, suggests growing confidence among workers emboldened by recent triumphs.Last month, the Supreme Court upheld a California law allowing unions to require collective-bargaining fees from non-members in state-government jobs. Banning the practice might have crippled the finances of public unions already stung by restrictions in Wisconsin and other states.Unions have also made headway pushing for higher minimum-wage laws. Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle increased base pay to at least $15 an hour, and New York this month agreed to move toward that level in much of the state. Moreover, presidential candidates are showing labor some love. Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders joined Verizon employees on the picket line, and Hillary Clinton has been courting unions heavily. Republican hopeful Donald Trump has parlayed populist positions on trade and other economic issues into boisterous support among union employees.Organized labor has its work cut out for it, though. Membership has held steady over the past two years at about 15 million employees, or roughly 11 percent of the American workforce, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. In 1983, when data was first collected, there were almost 18 million union workers comprising more than 20 percent of the workforce. And while 35 percent of public-sector workers are union members, Wisconsin's successful campaign against them has proven popular around the country. Unions may have much to celebrate. There is, however, a lot of ground to make up.CONTEXT NEWS  - Some 40,000 Verizon Communications workers on April 13 walked off the job because of disagreements about planned cuts in healthcare and pension-related benefits over the next three years.- The strike called by the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers involves customer-services representatives, network technicians in landline-telephone operations and employees in similar jobs.

Thomson One users can register at RT/DAY/US. All times in ET/GMT)  WEEK AHEAD  Markets have a number of issues to focus on next week, beginning with the outcome of Sunday's meeting of oil ministers from the major oil producing nations. But nobody should get their hopes up all that much for a major change in OPEC's production levels. Earnings will drive markets after that, with reports expected from plenty of blue-ship stocks including Alphabet, Microsoft, Coca-Cola, Visa, General Electric and others.  A slew of Dow 30 companies report results next week, including UnitedHealth Group Inc, Johnson & Johnson, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and the world's largest chipmaker Intel Corp on Tuesday; American Express Co, the world's largest soda maker Coca-Cola Co on Wednesday; Microsoft Corp, the No. 1 U.S. wireless phone service provider Verizon Communications Inc, and the world's largest payments network operator Visa Inc on Thursday, while General Electric Co's and McDonald's Corp's first quarter earnings are due on Friday. J&J kicks off the earnings season for large U.S. drugmakers and is expected to report moderately higher earnings, bolstered by cost cuts and growing sales of its treatments for cancer, arthritis and psoriasis. UnitedHealth will set the tone for other insurers and investors will be listening for their plans on Obamacare. American Express is expected to report a decline in profit as it continues to look beyond cutting costs to improve profit to make up for losing a lucrative contract with warehouse club retailer Costco Wholesale Corp. Goldman Sachs' profit is expected to be hurt by weak capital markets, trading revenues and investment banking fees amid uncertainty over U.S. interest rates, China's slowing economy, and low oil prices. Meanwhile, Intel is expected to report a rise in revenue beating analysts average estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Coca-Cola's revenue is also expected to be slightly better than expected, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Separately, Verizon's profit and revenue is expected to be in line with analysts' estimates. Microsoft's expected rise in third-quarter revenue is likely to beating analysts' estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Visa's second-quarter profit is expected to decline as a volatile global economy and the strong dollar cut into revenue from customers outside the United States.  Next week, investors will be looking mostly for housing market data, from housing starts, building permits on Tuesday to existing home sales numbers on Wednesday. Housing starts, as measured by the U.S. Commerce Department are expected to have dropped to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.170 million units in March from 1.178 million units in February. Building permits are likely to have increased to a 1.2 million-unit rate last month. Meanwhile, home resales probably rose in March after a sharp fall in February. Existing home sales, as measured by the National Association of Realtors is expected to have gained 3.5 percent to an annual rate of 5.29 million units. Sales dropped 7.1 percent to an annual rate of 5.08 million units in February. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve release its business activity index on Thursday, while on Friday, Markit releases its preliminary data for U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers' index, which is expected to have advanced to 52.0 in April from 51.5 in March. Alphabet Inc, on Thursday, is expected to report a rise in first-quarter revenue that is likely to beat analysts average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Investors will be looking for continued growth at Alphabet's Google unit, which has been driven by strong mobile advertising sales. Investors will also be keen to gather more information on the company's Other Bets business, which includes glucose-monitoring contact lenses and Internet balloons. Capital expenditures in the business are expected to increase this year, although no concrete details have been offered.  Schlumberger is expected to report a fall in first-quarter profit on Thursday, hurt by weak drilling activity. The world's largest oilfield services provider, which recently closed its acquisition of Cameron International Corp, warned last month that its revenue would fall by about 15 percent from the fourth quarter.  General Motors Co will announce first-quarter results on Thursday. GM said on Friday it is recalling nearly 1.04 million newer pickup trucks for a seat belt flaw. The company said the recall in the United States includes 895,232 vehicles and a stop-sale of approximately 3,000 new 2014 and 2015 model year pickups still on dealer lots. The recall includes about 142,000 vehicles outside the United States.  BB&T Corp, Fifth Third Bancorp and KeyCorp are likely to report on Thursday a decline in first-quarter profit as they put aside more money for sour energy loans. Many lenders have ramped up reserves in recent months, concerned by the increasing number of energy companies that have gone bankrupt and defaulted on loans as oil prices stay stubbornly low.  U.S. homebuilders including D.R. Horton Inc and PulteGroup Inc report their quarterly results on Thursday. D.R. Horton and PulteGroup are expected to report a higher profit for the second quarter and first quarter, respectively, helped by higher home sales.  On Wednesday, Abbott Laboratories is expected to post first-quarter revenue that nudges past analysts' expectations, after missing estimates for the first time in four quarters in the previous quarter, largely thanks to forex headwinds. Analysts expect that passage of time and more stable forex rates will allow the underlying performance of the business to shine through this quarter, and they will be looking for any commentary on potential M&A activity.  Biogen Inc is expected to report a largely in-line first quarter on Thursday, as prescriptions written for its multiple sclerosis drug remain unchanged in the United States. Management previously noted that the uptick in scripts may not be seen until the second quarter. Investors will also look for more details on the Massachusetts-based drugmaker's hemophilia assets, which the company is said to be looking to sell.  Yahoo Inc's first-quarter profit is expected to have declined more than analysts average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The report on Tuesday comes a day after the end of a deadline for interested bidders to submit offers for Yahoo's internet business. There is high investors scrutiny on the auction, which came about as the struggling online search and advertising company succumbed to investor pressure stemming from its inability to boost revenue from ad sales.  Advertising group Omnicom Group Inc's first-quarter revenue is expected to fall more than analysts expect, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, due to a strong dollar. When the company posts its results on Tuesday, investors and analysts will be looking out for Omnicom's forecast for the second quarter and the full year, as well as details on possible share repurchases.

On Thursday, Johnson Controls Inc reports second-quarter earnings amid a pending merger with Ireland-based Tyco International Plc. The merger of Johnson Controls and Tyco International would save Johnson Controls $150 million a year in taxes.  Analysts on average expect American Airlines Group Inc, the world's largest airline, to report on Friday a dip in first-quarter profit due to a new profit-sharing plan with employees.

Analysts on average expect United Continental Holdings Inc to report a dip in first-quarter profit on Wednesday, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Investors will look for guidance on how the No.3 U.S. airline will stop its unit revenue decline and improve its industry-lagging reputation - a concern that activist shareholders raised in a brawl over the company's board of directors, whom they accuse of poor oversight.  Qualcomm Inc is expected to report a fall in second-quarter revenue on Wednesday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data.

Investors will look for forecast and commentary on sales for the second quarter.  AutoNation Inc, the biggest publicly traded auto dealer group, reports first-quarter results on Friday. CEO Mike Jackson is likely to speak on the auto industry in general and whether automakers are hurting themselves by increasing profit-eating incentives in order to top last year's record for U.S. auto sales. AutoNation has also long been aggressive in share buybacks, so investors will look for an update on its share repurchase program.  Sportswear maker Under Armour Inc is expected to report first-quarter profit below analysts' estimates on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data.

The two main economic reports in Canada next week will be inflation and retail sales, both due on Friday. The annual inflation rate is expected to have cooled to 1.2 percent in March, drifting further away from the Bank of Canada's target of 2 percent. Core inflation, which strips out volatile items and is more closely watched by the bank, is forecast to be a more robust 1.7 percent. Retail sales are expected to have fallen by 0.8 percent in February after strong gains last month. Analysts are expecting to see a pullback after the economy got off to a robust start at the beginning of the year and will be looking at the retail figures to see how the economy is faring.  Canadian Infrastructure Minister Amarjeet Sohi will speak on Tuesday about the role public-private partnerships will play in the government's C$120 billion 10-year infrastructure plan.

The country's inflation rate cooled in March to an annual rate of 2.60 percent, but the central bank has said that it expects the pace of consumer prices to rise slightly above its 3 percent target during the second and third quarters. Still, there has been little sign of widespread pressures on consumer prices despite a steep devaluation of the peso since late 2014.      European Central Bank (ECB) holds interest rate decision on Thursday. In the euro zone, economists said lacklustre demand, not inadequate credit, is holding the euro zone economy back. They say the ECB is unlikely to cut its deposit rate further from the current -0.40 percent. That too underscores the diminishing returns from monetary policy, especially since the ECB is well over a year into its trillion-plus euro stimulus programme, has cut rates several times and pledged long-term loans to banks, with little pick-up in inflation so far.   ON MONDAY, APRIL 18  Morgan Stanley's first-quarter profit is expected to have plunged during what is widely being considered the worst start to the year for global banks since the financial crisis in 2007-09. Revenue from both investment banking and trading are likely to have taken a hit amid worries about economic growth in China, stubbornly low oil prices and uncertainty surrounding the pace of U.S. interest rate hikes. Shares in Morgan Stanley will be sensitive to details on the bank's exposure to energy loans, outlook on deals, IPOs and trading for the rest of 2016.  PepsiCo Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue above the average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data.

Investors will look out for any updates to forecast, comments on acquisitions and any reaction to a potential law in the United States to tax some sugar-based products.  International Business Machines Corp is expected to report a fall in its first-quarter revenue below analysts' estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. It would represent the 16th straight quarter of declining revenue as a stronger U.S. dollar continues to hurt the the technology services company. The Dow Jones component, popularly known as Big Blue, has enjoyed a quiet recovery in 2016, with shares rising nearly 10 percent.  Netflix Inc's first-quarter profit is expected to fall more than analysts' estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, as the video streaming company continues to aggressively spend on international expansion and original content. Subscriber additions, perhaps one of the most scrutinized Netflix metrics, is likely to get a boost due to the March release of the new season of popular shows ""House of Cards"" and ""Daredevil"". However, investors will be looking out for Netflix's subscriber forecast for the next quarter, as users paying $7.99 per month for their subscriptions will see a $2 hike in May, which analysts expect will drive up churn.  National Association of Home Builders releases data on homebuilder sentiment. The NAHB Housing Market index is likely to have risen to 59 from 58 in April. (1000/1400)  Boston Federal Reserve Bank President Eric Rosengren gives a lecture in New Britain, Connecticut.

436,"   By Timothy Gardner | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The Obama administration on Friday weighed in on the debate over allowing consumers to switch from pricey cable television boxes to less expensive devices, urging regulators to set an example for the rest of government on how to boost competition.    Consumers can spend nearly $1,000 over four years renting cable set-top boxes. Allowing consumers to chose devices or apps they can own could mean quick savings, according to the administration.  ""Competition is good for consumers,"" President Barack Obama said in an interview with Yahoo Finance. ""And ultimately it's good for business. The more competition we have, the more products, services, innovation takes place.""The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in February proposed a rule to open competition in the $20 billion television set-top box market. It set a 60-day comment period for the rule that could deal a financial blow to cable companies. The administration issued a rare filing on the rule by the FCC, an independent agency.  The rule would allow consumers to obtain video services from providers such as Alphabet Inc's Google, Apple Inc and TiVo In, instead of cable, satellite and other television providers such Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc.It was unclear if the rule will be implemented before Obama leaves office in January. Cable and television companies have lashed out against the proposal, saying it could stifle innovation. Under the rule, minority programmers would be damaged, consumers would lose privacy protections and be saddled with the costs of re-engineering networks, said Michael Powell, the head of trade group National Cable & Telecommunications Association.  The companies also contended the White House is pressuring the FCC, which they said was inappropriate. ""This action not only damages the only companies seriously investing to build broadband infrastructure for this country, it also does great harm to the confidence we should be able to have in the impartiality of the FCC's proceedings,"" said Jim Cicconi, a senior executive vice president at AT&T Inc.Obama will also sign an executive order on Friday calling on federal agencies and departments to report in 60 days on areas where additional measures can be taken to open competition. In a teleconference call with reporters, Jason Furman, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, would not speculate on what kind of pro-competition measures the order could spur. The administration is looking to add to consumer-friendly actions on cell phones, net neutrality and retirement advice. “This is going to be a whole of government effort to empower consumers, workers and small businesses,” Furman said.

439,"   By Malathi Nayak and Sai Sachin R  Verizon Communications Inc said an ongoing strike by its wireline workers was expected to hurt earnings in the current quarter, even as it reported first-quarter net income that met analyst expectations amid strong tablet sales.Shares of Verizon, the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier, fell 3.4 percent to $49.99 at midday on Thursday.If the strike, now in its second week, continues for an extended period of time, it could pressure full-year earnings, Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said in an interview. ""We'd like to settle this sooner than later,"" Shammo said.About 40,000 employees of Verizon's wireline business, which includes its Fios Internet, telephone and TV services, went on strike after reaching an impasse in talks over a new labor contract. Issues include healthcare, offshoring of call center jobs, temporary job relocations and pensions.In the wireline business, consumer revenue of $4 billion was little changed from a year ago.  Net income attributable to the company rose to $4.31 billion, or $1.06 per share, in the first quarter, meeting analysts' expectations.   The company stood by its full-year profit forecast. Verizon has been scaling back its Fios TV and Internet business, which represented about 29 percent of its 2015 revenue.  ""Rather than investing in good jobs here at home, Verizon refuses to make Fios available to thousands of people ... throughout the East Coast and is embarking on a questionable path to acquire troubled Yahoo and other companies,"" Brooklyn-based Verizon field technician Anthony Finocchio, said in a statement on Thursday.   To tap new revenue, the company has shifted its focus to the advertising-supported Internet business and acquired AOL last June for $4.4 billion. It is seen as the front-runner in bidding for Yahoo Inc's core Internet business.The company, known for its high-quality network, is locked in a battle for subscribers with competitors in the saturated U.S. wireless market. Smaller rival Sprint Corp has been offering half-off discounts, and T-Mobile US Inc has launched free music and video-streaming plans. Verizon reported strong subscriber net additions for the first quarter ended March 31, adding 640,000 wireless retail postpaid subscribers, helped by tablet promotions during a seasonally slow period for phone upgrades. That surpassed analysts' average estimate of 480,000, according to market research firm FactSet StreetAccount.Customer defections, or churn, in Verizon's wireless postpaid business, dropped to 0.96 percent from 1.03 percent a year earlier.Total operating revenue rose 0.6 percent to $32.17 billion, falling slightly short of analysts' average estimate of $32.46 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Sticking points include offshore call-center jobs, job relocations and healthcare coverage.The striking workers have about $1.3 billion in Verizon stock holdings, according to the unions.

Verizon shareholders rejected this proposal on Thursday,  according to Don Dunn,a union representative and Long Island, New York-based Fios field technician, who attended the meeting.

481,"   By Chuck Mikolajczak  A tentative deal between Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and leaders of striking unions includes 1,400 new jobs and pay raises topping 10 percent, the company and unions representing about 40,000 workers said on Monday, hoping to end a walkout that has lasted nearly seven weeks.One analyst called the deal ""very rich"" for workers at Verizon, the No. 1 U.S. wireless provider, which reached the tentative pact with the Communications Workers of America (CWA) on Friday. Details for the new four-year contract were disclosed on Monday.The CWA said Verizon agreed to provide a 10.9 percent raise over four years while Verizon put the increase at 10.5 percent. According to the CWA, both numbers are correct, with the union's calculation including compounded interest as subsequent raises are determined from a new base salary.“They needed to end the strike and they bit the bullet,"" said Roger Entner of Recon Analytics. He said he thinks the deal ""reinforced their commitment to basically exiting"" wireline, which he called ""the least profitable, most problematic part of the business”The new contract ""gives Verizon four years basically to get rid of the unit. Let it be somebody else’s problem,” Entner said. But not all analysts saw the deal as the first steps in an eventual sale of the wireline business. ""That is an option available for Verizon,"" said Jim Patterson, CEO of Patterson Advisory Group. ""However, their recent investment in XO (fiber-optic business) would seem to indicate that infrastructure is becoming a more vital part of the business.” Nearly 40,000 network technicians and customer service representatives of the company's Fios internet, telephone and television services units walked off the job on April 13. Striking workers will be back on the job on Wednesday, the CWA said. Joshua B. Freeman, labor historian and CUNY professor at Queens College in New York said he would call the contract a win for the union, while noting the increasing rarity of a strike of that size and length. ""These guys not only struck and survived but actually came out of it with a pretty good contract,"" he said. ""These days, that is a very unusual thing, to see that kind of walkout.""   TENTATIVE NEW CONTRACT The workers have been without a contract since the agreement expired in August; healthcare coverage ran out at the end of April. In 2011, Verizon workers went on strike for two weeks after negotiations deadlocked.The latest work stoppage stretched across states including New York, Massachusetts and Virginia.

482,"   By Chuck Mikolajczak  A tentative deal between Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and leaders of striking unions includes 1,400 new jobs and pay raises topping 10 percent, the company and unions representing about 40,000 workers said on Monday, hoping to end a walkout that has lasted nearly seven weeks.One analyst called the deal ""very rich"" for workers at Verizon, the No. 1 U.S. wireless provider, which reached the tentative pact with the Communications Workers of America (CWA) on Friday. Details for the new four-year contract were disclosed on Monday.The CWA said Verizon agreed to provide a 10.9 percent raise over four years while Verizon put the increase at 10.5 percent. According to the CWA, both numbers are correct, with the union's calculation including compounded interest as subsequent raises are determined from a new base salary.“They needed to end the strike and they bit the bullet,"" said Roger Entner of Recon Analytics. He said he thinks the deal ""reinforced their commitment to basically exiting"" wireline, which he called ""the least profitable, most problematic part of the business”The new contract ""gives Verizon four years basically to get rid of the unit. Let it be somebody else’s problem,” Entner said. But not all analysts saw the deal as the first steps in an eventual sale of the wireline business. ""That is an option available for Verizon,"" said Jim Patterson, CEO of Patterson Advisory Group. ""However, their recent investment in XO (fiber-optic business) would seem to indicate that infrastructure is becoming a more vital part of the business.” Nearly 40,000 network technicians and customer service representatives of the company's Fios internet, telephone and television services units walked off the job on April 13. Striking workers will be back on the job on Wednesday, the CWA said. Joshua B. Freeman, labor historian and CUNY professor at Queens College in New York said he would call the contract a win for the union, while noting the increasing rarity of a strike of that size and length. ""These guys not only struck and survived but actually came out of it with a pretty good contract,"" he said. ""These days, that is a very unusual thing, to see that kind of walkout.""   TENTATIVE NEW CONTRACT The workers have been without a contract since the agreement expired in August; healthcare coverage ran out at the end of April. In 2011, Verizon workers went on strike for two weeks after negotiations deadlocked.The latest work stoppage stretched across states including New York, Massachusetts and Virginia. Verizon brought in thousands of temporary workers. New York-based Verizon will add 1,300 call center jobs on the East Coast, and 100 new network technician jobs, Verizon spokesman Richard Young said.

484,"   By Lucia Mutikani | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. economy created the fewest number of jobs in more than 5-1/2-years in May as manufacturing and construction employment fell sharply, which could make it harder for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.Nonfarm payrolls increased by only 38,000 jobs last month, the smallest gain since September 2010, the Labor Department said on Friday. Employment gains were also restrained by a month-long strike by Verizon (VZ.N) workers, which depressed information sector payrolls by 34,000 jobs.Underscoring the report's weakness, employers hired 59,000 fewer workers in March and April than previously reported. While the unemployment rate fell three-tenths of a percentage point to 4.7 percent in May, the lowest level since November 2007, that was because 458,000 Americans gave up the search for work.""This is not a good report, and it may well give Fed officials second thoughts about increasing interest rates again this month or next, as some have suggested lately,"" said Peter Ireland, an economics professor at Boston College.The Fed has signaled its intention to raise rates soon if job gains continue and economic data remain consistent with a pickup in growth in the second quarter. Fed Chair Yellen said last week that a rate increase would probably be appropriate in the ""coming months,"" if those conditions were met. The U.S. central bank hiked its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade.The dollar .DXY tumbled against a basket of currencies on Friday and was on track for its largest one-day percentage loss in four months. U.S. stocks also fell, while prices for U.S. Treasuries rose.Financial markets largely priced out a rate increase at the Fed's June 14-15 policy meeting after Friday's data, according to CME Group's FedWatch program. The chance of an increase in July fell to 37 percent from about 59 percent late on Thursday.Economists had forecast payrolls rising by 164,000 in May and the unemployment rate falling to 4.9 percent.The weak report bucks data on consumer spending, industrial production and housing that have indicated the economy was gaining momentum after growth slowed to a 0.8 percent annualized rate in the first quarter. In separate reports on Friday, the Commerce Department said goods exports rebounded strongly in April and orders for manufactured goods recorded their biggest gain in six months.A survey by the Institute for Supply Management, however, showed a significant cooling in services sector activity in May.DELAYED RESPONSE  Some economists said the sharp slowdown in employment last month was payback after unseasonably warm weather boosted hiring in February and March. They also viewed the weak payroll growth as a delayed response to tepid economic growth in the previous two quarters. ""The simplest explanation is that job growth tends to respond with a lag to GDP growth, and GDP growth was rather weak around the turn of the year. This would suggest job growth should recover along with overall growth in economic activity,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.Despite the poor performance in May, job creation has averaged 150,000 a month this year. That is well above the 100,000 monthly employment increase that Yellen has said is needed to keep up with growth in the work-age population.Last month, the goods producing sector, which includes mining, manufacturing and construction, shed 36,000 jobs, the most since February 2010. Even excluding the Verizon strike, payrolls would have only increased by just over 70,000. The Verizon workers, who were considered unemployed because they did not receive a salary during the payrolls survey week, returned to their jobs on Wednesday. They are expected to boost June employment.Other details of the employment report were not encouraging. Average hourly earnings rose five cents, or 0.2 percent. That was a slide from April's 0.4 percent increase and left the year-on-year rise at 2.5 percent.  A broad measure of unemployment that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment held steady at 9.7 percent.The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, fell 0.2 percentage point to 62.6 percent. That drop unwound about two-thirds of the rise seen between last September and March of this year. The weakness in the May employment data was broad-based.The private sector added only 25,000 jobs, the smallest number since February 2010. Manufacturing employment fell by 10,000 jobs and construction payrolls dropped by 15,000, the most since December 2013.Mining employment maintained its downward trend, shedding 10,000 positions. Mining payrolls have dropped by 207,000 since peaking in September 2014, with three-quarters of the losses in support activities.Retail payrolls rose 11,400 after losing jobs in April for the first time since December 2014. Wholesale trade employment fell by 10,300 jobs. Temporary-help jobs, a harbinger for future hiring, dropped by 21,000.There were declines in utilities and transportation and warehousing employment. Government payrolls increased by 13,000 and healthcare jobs jumped by 55,400.

The jobless rate is forecast slipping one-tenth of a percentage point to 4.9 percent.A government report last week suggested a month-long strike by Verizon workers could slice 35,100 jobs from payrolls in May. The striking workers, who returned to their jobs on Wednesday, were regarded as unemployed because they did not receive a salary during the payrolls survey week.Without the strike, employment would probably have risen by about 200,000 jobs, matching the monthly average for the first quarter. Economists and Fed Chair Janet Yellen say monthly gains of roughly 100,000 jobs are needed to keep up with growth in the work-age population. The Labor Department is scheduled to release the jobs data at 8:30 a.m. EDT (1230 GMT). It will likely confirm the economy has bounced back after growth almost stalled at the start of the year.""As long as the report is essentially in line with April or better, we think it will support the Fed's outlook for a 25-basis-point rate hike in June or July,"" said Terry Sheehan, a senior analyst at Stone & McCarthy in Princeton, New Jersey.The U.S. central bank has signaled its intention to raise rates soon if job gains continue and economic data remain consistent with a pickup in growth in the second quarter.Yellen said last week that a rate increase would probably be appropriate in the ""coming months,"" if those conditions were met. Data on consumer spending, industrial production, goods exports and housing have suggested the economy is gathering speed after growth slowed to a 0.8 percent annualized rate in the first quarter. Financial markets see a small chance of a rate increase at the Fed's June 14-15 policy meeting, but are pricing in a roughly 59 percent probability at the July gathering, according to CME Group's FedWatch program. The Fed hiked its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade.MODEST WAGE GROWTH Despite a tightening labor market, there is still no sign of meaningful wage growth. Average hourly earnings are forecast rising 0.2 percent in May after gaining 0.3 percent in April. That would keep the year-on-year rise at 2.5 percent. ""There is more shadow slack given the absence of a noticeable acceleration in wage growth,"" said Ryan Sweet, senior economist at Moody's Analytics in Westchester, Pennsylvania.Economists say wage growth of between 3.0 percent and 3.5 percent is needed to lift inflation to the Fed's 2.0 percent target. There are, however, signs that inflation is creeping higher as the dampening effects of the dollar's past rally and the oil price plunge dissipate.Other measures of labor market slack, including the number of Americans working part-time for economic reasons, will be watched for clues on how soon the job market will hit full employment.A broad measure of unemployment that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment is currently at an eight-year low.Job gains in May were likely broad-based, although mining employment probably maintained its downward trend. Mining payrolls have dropped by 191,000 since peaking in September 2014, with three-quarters of the losses in support activities.Manufacturing employment is expected to have slipped by 1,000 jobs after increasing by 4,000 in April. The Verizon labor dispute probably reduced information sector jobs by 35,100.Retail payrolls likely rebounded after shedding jobs in April for the first time since December 2014. An improvement is also expected in temporary help jobs, which have weakened since January.(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Paul Simao)",2016-06-03,VZ,"Fri Jun 3, 2016 | 12:00am EDT",WRAPUP 1-U.S. job gains in May likely dented by Verizon strike,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-economy-idUSL1N18U21Y?type=companyNews

494,"   By Greg Roumeliotis | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. telecommunications rivals Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc are set to go through to the third and final round of bidding in the auction for Yahoo Inc's core internet assets, according to people familiar with the matter.After holding a board meeting to review second-round offers, Yahoo will start reaching out to bidders as early as Monday to notify them whether they will make it to the next round, one of the people said.Verizon, the biggest U.S. wireless carrier, is seeking to challenge AT&T, the second largest U.S. wireless provider, in the third round of bidding, even though its latest offer was at the low end of the $3.5 billion to $5 billion range of the second-round bids that came in last week, the people said.Yahoo hopes to conclude the auction by next month, according to one of the people. The Sunnyvale, California-based company started exploring a sale of the assets after coming under pressure from activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP.A consortium led by Quicken Loans Inc founder Dan Gilbert, and backed by Berkshire Hathaway Inc Chairman Warren Buffett, will also make it through to the final round, the people added. Some private equity firms that had made it through to the second round will not be invited to submit third-round bids, another of the people said.The people familiar with the matter asked not to be identified because the bids were confidential.Yahoo, Verizon and AT&T declined to comment. A Quicken Loans spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on behalf of Gilbert's consortium. Not all offers involve exactly the same assets, with some bidders indicating they are not interested in some of the patents and real estate assets on offer, sources have previously said.Verizon is primarily interested in Yahoo's advertising technology tools. It has been examining how the other assets up for sale, such as search, mail and messenger services, could be combined with the corresponding businesses of AOL, which it acquired last year for $4.4 billion, Reuters reported last month. AT&T has been seeking to catch up with Verizon in advertising technology as it seeks to expand in mobile video offerings.A sale of Yahoo's internet assets would leave the company just owning a 35.5 percent stake in Yahoo Japan Corp, as well as a 15 percent stake in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, which accounts for most of its value.In December, Yahoo scrapped plans to spin off its Alibaba stake, after investors fretted over whether that transaction could have been carried out on a tax-free basis.

495,"   By Malathi Nayak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Unions representing nearly 40,000 Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) workers ratified a new labor deal on Friday, the company said, ending a months-long dispute that had prompted a nearly 7-week employee strike.The new contract, effective immediately, will run until Aug. 3, 2019, Verizon said in a statement. Last month, a tentative deal was reached that included 1,400 new jobs and pay raises topping 10 percent.Since May 31, union members had been casting votes that were tallied by the unions. Workers including network technicians and customer service representatives in Verizon's Fios internet, telephone and television services units walked off the job on April 13 after contract talks reached an impasse.

496,"   By Malathi Nayak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Unions representing nearly 40,000 Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) workers ratified a new labor deal on Friday, the company said, ending a months-long dispute that had prompted a nearly 7-week employee strike.The new contract, effective immediately, will run until Aug. 3, 2019, Verizon said in a statement. Last month, a tentative deal was reached that included 1,400 new jobs and pay raises topping 10 percent.Since May 31, union members had been casting votes that were tallied by the unions. Workers including network technicians and customer service representatives in Verizon's Fios internet, telephone and television services units walked off the job on April 13 after contract talks reached an impasse.

499,"   By Malathi Nayak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), the No. 1 U.S. wireless provider, said on Wednesday that it would increase plan rates but expand data buckets by 30 percent for its customers, who increasingly stream content through mobile devices.Starting July 7, the company will roll out a revamped version of its My Verizon mobile app to let customers control data overages and billing, as well as manage plans, it said. Moreover, emulating moves by some of its rivals such as AT&T Inc (T.N) and T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O), it will let customers carry unused data over to the next month and begin offering users on certain plans unlimited text and calling to and from Mexico and Canada.The redesigned plans and app come as the company, known for its high-quality network, is locked in a battle for subscribers with competitors in the saturated U.S. wireless market. Smaller rival Sprint Corp (S.N) has been offering half-off discounts, and T-Mobile has launched free music, video-streaming plans and other customer-friendly offers and free gifts to attract customers away from competitors to their networks. The new rate plans are meant to help customers tackle data overage costs and ""reflect the significant growth in individual data use,"" Rob Miller, vice president of consumer pricing at Verizon said in a webcast on Wednesday.Verizon is hiking rates and increasing data across all its plans. For instance, the basic ""S"" plan will cost $35, a $5 rise, and offer double the data at 2 gigabytes and the high-end ""XXL"" plan will cost $10 more at $110 and offer 24 gigabytes as opposed to the previous 16 gigabyte limit. The company also said it will introduce a ""safety mode"" that protects customers from data overages by slowing down their speeds. The feature is free for those on the ""XL"" and ""XXL"" plans and costs $5 for those on the ""S"", ""M"", ""L"" plans, it said.To tap new revenue beyond its bread-and-butter wireless business, the company has shifted its focus to the advertising-supported Internet business and acquired AOL last June for $4.4 billion. It is seen as the front-runner in bidding for Yahoo Inc's (YHOO.O) core Internet business. Verizon shares were relatively unchanged at $55.93 in afternoon trading.

510,"   By Greg Roumeliotis and Liana B. Baker  Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) is focusing on U.S. telecommunications company Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) as the buyer of its core business after reviewing final bids that it received this week, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.A deal would boost Verizon's AOL internet business, which the company acquired last year for $4.4 billion, by giving it access to Yahoo's advertising technology tools, as well other assets such as search, mail, messenger and real estate. These synergies have made Verizon the favorite among industry analysts to prevail in the auction.The sale would also mark the end of Yahoo as an operating company, leaving it only as the owner of a 35.5 percent stake in Yahoo Japan, as well as its 15 percent interest in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N). Those two stakes account for most of Yahoo's $37 billion market capitalization.Yahoo views Verizon as the buyer that can deliver the most value, but negotiations between the two companies are continuing, and no agreement has yet been reached, the sources said. Yahoo would like to have a deal for the core assets by the end of July, one of the sources added.Bloomberg News, which reported earlier that Verizon was nearing an agreement to buy the Yahoo assets, cited an anonymous source as saying the companies were discussing a price close to $5 billion. Yahoo shares were up 0.6 percent at $39.09 in morning trading, while Verizon rose 1.3 percent to $56.09.The sources requested anonymity because the negotiations are confidential. Verizon and Yahoo did not respond to requests for comment.""Verizon has always been the favorite because it has the largest potential synergies and therefore can pay the most,"" said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. ""The price negotiations still can be tough because it also doesn't need Yahoo. It can put its money into its AOL franchise.""  Verizon is already working on increasing revenue through its go90 ad-supported mobile video service targeted at millennials. The app, which was introduced in October, offers videos from Comedy Central, Vice and other programmers, as well as basketball and football games.Other bidders for the Yahoo assets include Verizon rival AT&T (T.N); a consortium led by Quicken Loans founder Dan Gilbert and backed by billionaire Warren Buffett; private equity firm TPG Capital LP; and a consortium of buyout firms Vector Capital and Sycamore Partners, sources have said previously.AOL Chief Executive Officer Tim Armstrong, who made his name leading sales at Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, is highly regarded in the advertising community. Analysts say it is unlikely that Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, another former Google high-flyer who has struggled to turn her internet company around, would join him at AOL. LOSING GROUND TO COMPETITORS In December, Yahoo scrapped plans to spin off its Alibaba stake after investors fretted over whether that transaction could have been carried out on a tax-free basis. It instead decided to explore a sale of its core assets, spurred on by activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP.Yahoo said in April that Starboard CEO Jeffrey Smith and three independent directors associated with him would join its board immediately. All four were on a slate that Starboard had proposed to oust Yahoo's entire board. Started in 1994 by Stanford graduate students Jerry Yang and David Filo, Yahoo in its early years was the destination of choice for many making their first forays into the World Wide Web. The company soared and then crashed in the first dot-com bubble before emerging as one of the few internet companies with substantial revenues and profits. By 2008, Yahoo was fending off a contentious takeover bid from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and struggling to define its mission.

""Some of those are earnings reports, but they all line up to the same thing: It looks like growth is quickening.""The Dow Jones industrial average rose 27.81 points, or 0.15 percent, to 18,545.04, the S&P 500 gained 7.46 points, or 0.34 percent, to 2,172.63 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 24.85 points, or 0.49 percent, to 5,098.76. Nine of 10 sectors were higher, led by utilities  and telecoms - defensive, high-dividend-paying groups that have lifted the market this year.AT&T climbed 1.1 percent after its results.  Verizon rose 1 percent. The company is the front-runner for Yahoo's core business, Reuters reported. Yahoo  was up 1.1 percent.Industrials were the lone sector in negative territory, dragged down by a 1.9-percent decline in GE shares. The U.S. industrial conglomerate reported weak demand for new oil, gas and transportation equipment. Rival Honeywell fell 2.5 percent after the diversified manufacturer lowered its full-year sales forecast.Still, second-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies, which started reporting in earnest this week, are now expected to decline by only 3 percent, less severe than the 4.5 percent drop estimated at the start of the month, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Results from about 40 percent of the S&P 500 are due next week.Investors will also be watching the Federal Reserve's meeting next week for clues about when the U.S. central bank might next seek to raise interest rates.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.90-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.99-to-1 ratio favored advancers.The S&P 500 posted 33 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 91 new highs and 18 new lows.

512,"   By Greg Roumeliotis and Liana B. Baker  Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) is focusing on U.S. telecommunications company Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) as the buyer of its core business after reviewing final bids that it received this week, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.A deal would boost Verizon's AOL internet business, which the company acquired last year for $4.4 billion, by giving it access to Yahoo's advertising technology tools, as well other assets such as search, mail, messenger and real estate. These synergies have made Verizon the favorite among industry analysts to prevail in the auction.The sale would also mark the end of Yahoo as an operating company, leaving it only as the owner of a 35.5 percent stake in Yahoo Japan, as well as its 15 percent interest in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N). Those two stakes account for most of Yahoo's $37 billion market capitalization.Yahoo views Verizon as the buyer that can deliver the most value, but negotiations between the two companies are continuing, and no agreement has yet been reached, the sources said. Yahoo would like to have a deal for the core assets by the end of July, one of the sources added.Bloomberg News, which reported earlier that Verizon was nearing an agreement to buy the Yahoo assets, cited an anonymous source as saying the companies were discussing a price close to $5 billion. Yahoo shares were up 0.6 percent at $39.09 in morning trading, while Verizon rose 1.3 percent to $56.09.The sources requested anonymity because the negotiations are confidential. Verizon and Yahoo did not respond to requests for comment.""Verizon has always been the favorite because it has the largest potential synergies and therefore can pay the most,"" said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. ""The price negotiations still can be tough because it also doesn't need Yahoo. It can put its money into its AOL franchise.""  Verizon is already working on increasing revenue through its go90 ad-supported mobile video service targeted at millennials. The app, which was introduced in October, offers videos from Comedy Central, Vice and other programmers, as well as basketball and football games.Other bidders for the Yahoo assets include Verizon rival AT&T (T.N); a consortium led by Quicken Loans founder Dan Gilbert and backed by billionaire Warren Buffett; private equity firm TPG Capital LP; and a consortium of buyout firms Vector Capital and Sycamore Partners, sources have said previously.AOL Chief Executive Officer Tim Armstrong, who made his name leading sales at Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, is highly regarded in the advertising community. Analysts say it is unlikely that Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, another former Google high-flyer who has struggled to turn her internet company around, would join him at AOL. LOSING GROUND TO COMPETITORS In December, Yahoo scrapped plans to spin off its Alibaba stake after investors fretted over whether that transaction could have been carried out on a tax-free basis. It instead decided to explore a sale of its core assets, spurred on by activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP.Yahoo said in April that Starboard CEO Jeffrey Smith and three independent directors associated with him would join its board immediately. All four were on a slate that Starboard had proposed to oust Yahoo's entire board. Started in 1994 by Stanford graduate students Jerry Yang and David Filo, Yahoo in its early years was the destination of choice for many making their first forays into the World Wide Web. The company soared and then crashed in the first dot-com bubble before emerging as one of the few internet companies with substantial revenues and profits. By 2008, Yahoo was fending off a contentious takeover bid from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and struggling to define its mission. That question was never really answered, leading to years of management instability and shifting priorities. Google, Facebook Inc (FB.O), Amazon.com Inc <AMZN.O. and a host of new companies, meanwhile, claimed much of the territory that might have been Yahoo's.(This version of the story has been refiled to remove extraneous word ""to"" in first paragraph) (Reporting by Greg Roumeliotis in New York and Liana B.

527,"  (Adds Australian joint venture response in 5th last graf)By Malathi Nayak and Deborah M. ToddNEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO, July 25 Verizon Communications Inc said on Monday it would buy Yahoo Inc's core internet properties for $4.83 billion in cash, marking the end of the line for a storied Web pioneer and setting the stage for a big new internet push by the telecom giant.Verizon will combine Yahoo's search, email and messenger assets as well as advertising technology tools with its AOL unit, which it bought last year for $4.4 billion. Verizon has been looking to mobile video and advertising for new sources of revenue outside the oversaturated wireless market.The No. 1 U.S. wireless operator is betting that it can take data on more than 200 million unique monthly visitors to Yahoo sites, many of them on mobile devices, and combine it with data on 150 million or so unique monthly AOL users and data on its own user base of over 100 million wireless subscribers to offer a more targeted service for advertisers.Barclays said last month Verizon could save $500 million a year in costs of acquiring internet traffic and other expenses by buying Yahoo's internet business.The deal likely means more investment in popular content sites such as AOL's Huffington Post and Yahoo Finance when they become part of a much larger entity.""It now becomes somewhat easier to justify investing in content,"" said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research.Verizon said it would provide more detail on the strategy behind the acquisition when it announces second-quarter earnings on Tuesday.LONG WAY DOWN The deal came after activist investors led by Starboard Value LP lost faith in Yahoo Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer, who was hired in 2012, and forced what became a protracted sale process. Yahoo, founded in 1994, was a dominant player in the early days of the internet, but has long lost its leadership position in internet search and advertising to Alphabet Inc's  Google, Facebook Inc and others.Mayer said on a conference call with investors that she planned to stay at Yahoo through the deal's close. Marni Walden, head of product innovation and new business at Verizon, will head the combined internet unit and said no decisions had yet been made on the management team.""Yahoo gives us scale that is what is most critical here,"" said Walden, adding that the company's audience will go from the millions to the billions. ""We want to compete and that is the place we need to be.""Mayer, in an interview with Reuters, said she still saw a ""path to growth"" for Yahoo, especially in mobile. ""What's exciting about the Verizon transaction is that it brings us back to growth sooner,"" she said. She said she was ""open-minded"" about a possible role with the combined companies.But analysts expect AOL CEO Tim Armstrong - like Mayer a one-time Google executive - to be the driving force behind the combined companies. Yahoo is still one of the largest properties on the internet, with hundreds of millions of customers using its email, finance and sports offerings, among others, and a heavily trafficked home page.But Google has a stranglehold on the internet search business and built an industry-leading email service, while Facebook dominates in mobile and social media. Meanwhile, traditional web banner advertising, long Yahoo's strength, has become much less lucrative in the age of mobile and video.""It's a decade of mismanagement that has finally ended for Yahoo,"" said Recon Analytics analyst Roger Entner. ""It's the continuation of an extension of Verizon's strategy toward becoming a wireless internet player and a move away from (telecom) regulation for Verizon into an unregulated growth industry.Under Armstrong, AOL has beefed up its advertising technology with a string of acquisitions, and launched the mobile video service go90. Verizon has not disclosed how financially successful the unit has been, but Armstrong, known as a formidable salesman, has clearly won the confidence of Verizon's leaders.FAR BEHIND GOOGLE, FACEBOOK  The integration of Yahoo will not come without challenges. In its latest results, it reported a second-quarter net loss of $439.9 million as it wrote down the value of Tumblr, the microblogging and social media service it acquired in 2013 for $1.1 billion.Even with AOL and Yahoo, Verizon would still be far behind s Google and Facebook. According to eMarketer, Yahoo is expected to generate $2.32 billion in net U.S. digital ad sales, while AOL is expected to make $1.3 billion in 2016. Facebook and Google are forecast to deliver sales of $10.3 billion and $24.63 billion, respectively, by the end of this year.The Verizon deal would transform Yahoo into a holding company, with a 15 percent stake in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and a 35.5 percent interest in Yahoo Japan Corp as well as Yahoo's convertible notes, certain minority investments and its non-core patents.Yahoo executives said the remaining company is structured to ""indefinitely"" hold its Yahoo Japan and Alibaba stakes. They are worth about $40 billion based on their market capitalizations, while Yahoo had a market value of about $37.4 billion at Friday's close.Australia's top-rating free-to-air television network Seven West Media, which has an online joint venture with Yahoo, said it will consider ""various options"" if its 50:50 digital partner gets sold. It declined to name the options but noted that it has ""dramatically expanded its digital products"" beyond the Yahoo7 business.Yahoo will continue as an independent company until the deal receives shareholder and regulatory approvals, the companies said. It is expected to close in early 2017. It plans to change its name and become a publicly traded investment company.Yahoo currently has $7.7 billion in cash, in addition to the $4.8 billion it will receive at the close of the deal, which it plans to return to shareholders, Yahoo executives said on the call.Verizon prevailed over rival bidders, including AT&T Inc  ; a group led by Quicken Loans founder Dan Gilbert and backed by billionaire Warren Buffett; private equity firm TPG Capital Management LP ; and a consortium of buyout firms Vector Capital and Sycamore Partners.Under pressure from Starboard, Yahoo launched an auction of its core business in February after shelving plans to spin off its stake in Alibaba.(Additional reporting by Anya George Tharakan in Bengaluru, Jessica Toonkel in New York and Byron Kaye in Sydney; Writing by Jonathan Weber; Editing by Bernadette Baum, Jeffrey Benkoe and Bill Rigby)",2016-07-26,VZ,"Mon Jul 25, 2016 | 9:07pm EDT",UPDATE 7-Verizon to buy Yahoo's core business for $4.8 bln in digital ad push,http://www.reuters.com//article/yahoo-ma-verizon-idUSL4N1AB3HT?type=companyNews

529,"   By Catherine Ngai | NEW YORK  NEW YORK For the oil industry, Yahoo Inc's (YHOO.O) decision this week to sell its core business to Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) for $4.8 billion does not matter all that much. Their world already changed a few months ago, when the company said it would jettison its messaging system that has been the norm for oil traders since the late 1990s.Back then, Yahoo's technology revolutionized the industry, helping usher in a new era of high-speed communication that changed the way millions of barrels of oil traded daily. For Gene Grabinski, who was trading crude in Chicago for BP Plc (BP.L), one of the largest energy companies in the world, it was just the solution needed to stem the endless flood of phone calls as he bought and sold crude in the Midwest and U.S. Gulf. And it came about only because he saw his young daughters using messaging services back in the late 1990s.Come Aug. 5, Yahoo is scuttling its legacy instant messaging service as it seeks to move users to its new Messenger platform, which traders will not use because it fails to meet the industry's compliance standards. The announcement was made in June, prior to the Verizon deal. A company spokeswoman said that Yahoo will focus efforts on its new system, which will deliver better personal communication experiences to its users. For almost two decades, tens of thousands in the oil industry relied on the old Yahoo Messenger system, which launched in 1998. At that time, Grabinski was one of just two traders responsible for trading physical, domestic crude for BP, which owns some of the nation's biggest refineries including its facility in Whiting, Indiana, and previously Texas City, Texas. But Grabinski had a problem. Every day, his phone ""looked like a Christmas tree,"" he said, with red and green lights blinking as a flood of brokers called and were put on hold while Grabinski tried to gather market prices. After seeing his younger daughters, 11 and 7, use online instant messaging to chat with friends, he figured he could use the same system at work at the British major. ""The 11-year-old was on it and we were actively monitoring it at the time. I was aware of it, but I wasn't really doing it until it came up and I had the potential to use it in the work context,"" said Grabinski, who traded crude for more than a decade at BP starting in the early 1990s.  EARLY ADOPTERS It is not clear how Yahoo took the industry by storm, but Grabinski was part of the first wave of oil traders to use Yahoo instant messaging, having opened his account just a year after it was launched. BP was an early adopter of the technology, and several traders said their use of Yahoo helped spur the industry forward, even though Yahoo never actively encouraged the trading community to use its service. Grabinski - now a senior crude trader at Italian oil company Eni Trading & Shipping (ENI.MI) - decided on Yahoo because it was newer than AOL's AIM chat, already used by his counterparts in power and natural gas trading. He set up a computer screen between himself and the only other domestic, physical-focused trader at the shop. Using his account, they communicated with the rest of the market. Slowly, its use became more widespread. Today, everyone from oil traders to hedge fund managers, pipeline schedulers, brokers, refinery buyers and even ship brokers uses the chat system globally. ""There's a lot of back and forth, asking other people 'What are you seeing? What are you hearing?'"" said Tariq Zahir, an investment manager at Tyche Capital Advisors.FUTURE CHAT OPTIONS  Oil companies are finding various solutions for communication going forward. Some large players, including Glencore Plc (GLEN.L), have adopted Intercontinental Exchange Inc's (ICE.N) chat. ICE said last month that it has more than 10,000 active users for its messaging system, having grown by 15 percent since January.Other chat systems include Symphony, CME Group Inc's (CME.O) Pivot chat, Bloomberg chat, and Thomson Reuters Messenger. Reuters News is a division of Thomson Reuters Corp (TRI.TO).Some have also discussed more widely used mobile options like WhatsApp, Skype or WeChat, which is popular in Asia. Grabinski said the transition to a new system should not be a problem.""Change is part of it, and you kind of just move on,"" he said. ""I don't think it's going to be that hard. You just type into a little box.""

531,"   By Malathi Nayak  Verizon Communications Inc said on Monday it would buy GPS vehicle tracking firm Fleetmatics Group Plc for about $2.4 billion in cash to bolster its expansion into the connected vehicle and fleet management market.Verizon, the No. 1 U.S wireless company, will pay $60 per  share, a premium of about 40 percent to Fleetmatics' closing price on Friday. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016.Shares in Fleetmatics soared 39 percent to $59.60 while Verizon dipped 0.7 percent to $55.01.Fleetmatics, with North American headquarters in Waltham, Massachusetts, develops software that shows fleet operators vehicle location, fuel usage, speed, mileage and other information on their mobile workforce, including a driver's behavioral data. As the market for smartphones and mobile devices gets saturated, Verizon and its biggest rival, AT&T Inc, are hoping that connecting more objects to their networks will provide new revenue.

545,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, September 06 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating to  Verizon Communications Inc.'s (Verizon; NYSE: VZ) $2.059 billion of senior  unsecured 4.2% notes due 2046. Proceeds will be used to repay the $870 million  principal balance of the 4.8% notes due 2044, as well as for general corporate  purposes. The company's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is 'A-' and the  Rating Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS Competitive Position: The ratings are supported by Verizon Wireless's (VZW)  strong competitive position, as evidenced through industry-low churn rates, high  margins and the extensive coverage of approximately 98% of the U.S. population  with its 4G LTE network. These factors are balanced against moderately high  leverage for the rating, which stems from the February 2014 acquisition of the  remaining 45% stake in VZW. Core Telecom Leverage: At June 30, 2016, core telecom leverage was 2.3x and  total adjusted debt/EBITDAR was 2.8x. Including the Yahoo acquisition and other  pending acquisitions, Fitch expects Verizon's core telecom leverage to decline  to approximately 2.2x by 2017 while total adjusted debt/EBITDAR is expected to  approximate 2.8x. Core telecom leverage excludes securitizations (both  off-balance-sheet and public/144A and on-balance-sheet asset-backed  securitizations). Securitizations are included in total adjusted debt/EBITDAR  measures. Pending Acquisitions: In July 2016, Verizon announced a definitive agreement  with Yahoo! Inc. (Yahoo) whereby it will acquire the subsidiaries holding  Yahoo's operating businesses for approximately $4.83 billion in a cash  transaction (subject to closing adjustments). The transaction is expected to  close in early 2017, following customary approvals including approvals by  regulators and Yahoo's shareholders. Verizon's acquisition of XO Communications'  (XO) fiber network business for approximately $1.8 billion is also expected to  close in the first half of 2017. In August 2016, the acquisition of telematics  provider Fleetmatics for $2.4 billion was announced, and the transaction is  expected to close by the end of 2016. Wireline Asset Sale: In April 2016, Verizon completed the sale of its wireline  operations in California, Texas and Florida to Frontier Communications Corp.  (Frontier) for $10.5 billion. Approximately $600 million of debt transferred  with the subsidiaries. Debt Reduction: In April 2016, Verizon used the $10.5 billion in Frontier  proceeds and cash on hand to tender for and redeem early $10.7 billion in  existing debt. Frontier also assumed $600 million in debt of the acquired  entities. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Fitch assumes Verizon's EBITDA grows below 1% in 2016 over 2015. Fitch expects  midsingle digit EBITDA growth in 2017, based on organic revenue growth slightly  below Fitch's expectations for domestic GDP growth plus the effect of  acquisitions. --Debt reduction in the core business, combined with EBITDA growth, is expected  to reduce core telecom leverage to the low 2x range by 2017/2018. --VZW will continue to generate strong free cash flow (FCF) on an operational  basis. VZW's simple FCF (EBITDA less capital spending) for the latest 12 months  (LTM) ended June 30, 2016, was approximately $28.3 billion. --In 2016, Fitch expects consolidated capital spending to be in line with  company guidance of $17.2 billion to $17.7 billion. Investment in the wireless  network continues to be an area of emphasis due to the strong demand for 4G LTE  capacity for rapidly growing data services. --Fitch has included modest spending on spectrum in the FCC's 600 MHz TV  broadcast auction, currently underway. Spectrum spending approaching or  exceeding levels spent in the AWS-3 auction will be an event-driven  consideration.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive Rating Action: Fitch believes a positive rating action is unlikely in  the foreseeable future, given current levels of leverage. Negative Rating Action: Fitch may take a negative rating action if operating  performance causes deleveraging to take place at a materially  slower-than-anticipated pace, either alone or in combination with material  debt-financed acquisitions. Discretionary management moves that cause leverage  to rise above 2.5x, such as another material acquisition or stock repurchases,  could lead to a negative action in the absence of a strong commitment to  deleverage. LIQUIDITY Strong Liquidity Profile: Verizon's liquidity is supported by its reported  consolidated cash balances, which were $2.9 billion at June 30, 2016, and by its  revolving credit facility (RCF). The undrawn $8 billion RCF matures in July 2018. Fitch expects Verizon to  maintain aggregate commercial paper (CP) balances within a level fully backed by  the RCF. The credit facility has no ratings triggers or other restrictive  financial covenants, such as leverage or interest coverage tests. Verizon's cash from operations in 2016 will be negatively affected by certain  items. The company will incur higher cash taxes on a business-as-usual basis as  the cash tax rate moves toward the effective tax rate and by the cash tax  payment arising from the gain on sale of the wireline assets to Frontier.  Additionally, wireless handset financing under the equipment installment  programs will pressure cash from operations, as the public securitizations  funding handset sales beginning in the third quarter of 2016 will be recorded in  cash from financing activities. This is a change in presentation from the  private securitizations undertaken in 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, which  were recorded in operating activities. Further, cash from operations in 2015 was  also boosted on a non-recurring basis by the portion of the tower sale proceeds  (approximately $2.4 billion) recorded in operating activities. Debt Maturities: On a consolidated basis, as of June 30, 2016 Verizon and its  subsidiaries had expected debt maturities of approximately $2.3 billion and $3.8  billion in 2016 and 2017, respectively.

The lawsuit seeks class-action status and unspecified damages. A Yahoo spokeswoman said the Sunnyvale, California-based company does not discuss pending litigation.The attack could complicate Chief Executive Marissa Mayer's effort to shore up the website's flagging fortunes, two months after she agreed to a $4.8 billion sale of Yahoo's Internet business to Verizon Communications Inc. Yahoo on Thursday said user information including names, email addresses, phone numbers, birth dates and encrypted passwords had been compromised in late 2014.But the lawsuit suggested that the breach might have been warded off had Yahoo, having been targeted by hackers before, lived up to its promise of taking user privacy ""seriously"" and bulked up its security measures. It also faulted Yahoo for taking roughly three times longer than organizations typically need to uncover the breach.Yahoo demonstrated ""reckless disregard for the security of its users' personal information that it promised to protect,"" according to the complaint.Schwartz is represented by two large U.S. class-action specialists, the law firms Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd and Labaton Sucharow.The case is Schwartz v Yahoo Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 16-05456.

556,"   By David Shepardson | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Federal Communications Commission will vote on Oct. 27 on a revised proposal for rules to safeguard privacy of broadband users.FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler's initial proposal came under harsh criticism from internet service providers such as Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T Inc and Comcast Corp, because it subjected them to more stringent rules than websites like Facebook Inc, Twitter or Alphabet Inc's Google, which are overseen by Federal Trade Commission rules.Providers had especially objected to sweeping ""opt in"" requirements under the initial proposal for using nearly all consumer data. Under the new proposal, providers must only get ""opt in"" or affirmative consent for sensitive data like health, finances, web browsing history, child data, and Social Security numbers.But it allows other data to be used with ""opt out"" or implied consent for marketing purposes. FCC officials said the new rules are more in line with FTC privacy rules for websites.USTelecom, a trade group representing Verizon, AT&T and others, said it was concerned the FCC ""is now attempting to redefine what consumers may regard as sensitive"" and might not agree with the FTC's definition.Wheeler said the FCC has long required telephone companies to protect information associated with phone calls and now must do the same with internet service. Several consumer groups including the Consumer Federation of America backed the revised proposal, as did Senator Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat.The FCC has authority to set broadband privacy rules after it reclassified broadband providers last year as part of new net neutrality regulations. A federal appeals court upheld that decision in June. Wheeler is working to complete an aggressive agenda this year, including the privacy proposal, as well as rules to reform the $40 billion market for business data services, known as special access lines, and to allow consumers to ditch pay TV set top boxes.A person briefed on the matter said Wheeler was circulating a revised proposal to reform the special access lines Thursday, but has not decided whether to bring it up for a vote on Oct. 27.In September, the FCC said it would delay a final vote on a landmark reform of the $20 billion television set-top box market, which could reduce bills for tens of millions of subscribers.Negotiations among the commissioners were continuing after the FCC's three Democrats in a joint statement last week expressed support for letting consumers drop set-top boxes, which route cable and broadcasting to televisions. They said they were ""working to resolve the remaining technical and legal issues.""",2016-10-06,VZ,"Thu Oct 6, 2016 | 5:23pm EDT",FCC to vote on revised broadband privacy regulations,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-fcc-privacy-idUSKCN1261UZ?type=companyNews

559,"  * Bond issuance sees sharp decline* Currency volatility weighs heavilyBy Laura BenitezLONDON, Oct 7 (IFR) - The cracks began to show in the sterling corporate bond market, just one week into the BoE's stimulus programme, as indigestion following a spate of new supply and torrid currency moves left investors holding big losses.Companies have issued new sterling bonds relentlessly over the last two months, in bid to secure ultra-low funding costs brought about by the Bank of England's stimulus measures.But issuance stopped in its tracks this week with just £300m of supply, compared to the £1.1bn sold the week before.""The sterling  market is experiencing some weakness, which hasn't been helped by the volatility regarding the currency moves this week,"" a banker said.The UK currency tanked to a 31-year low on Friday, as fears that Britain will suffer a hard exit from the European Union intensified.The trouble was highlighted earlier in the week, however, when Gatwick Airport attracted just £400m of demand for a £300m 30-year trade, which later capitulated in the after market. The bond crashed down to a cash price bid as low as 97.40 on Tuesday, according to Tradeweb, the day after it priced at 98.8. And as long-dated Gilts slumped on Friday in the wake of sterling's ""flash crash"", that bid collapsed to just 93.50 - more than five points below reoffer.""Gatwick was a real surprise, its deals normally do well and this struggled which tells you that the market is over supplied and needs to cool down,"" another banker said.While Gatwick is not yet eligible for the Bank of England's purchase programme, bankers expected it to emulate the positive momentum seen on Babcock's deal last week.That issuer, which is also currently ineligible for BoE purchases, lured over £1.1bn of orders for a £250m deal. And eligible names saw even stronger demand last month, with National Grid Gas attracting a mammoth £6bn of demand for its £3bn issue, the largest corporate sterling bond of all time.But bankers said that sterling performance will be closely monitored by investors over the coming weeks, and that only those taking a risk-on approach would opt to buy new deals.The iBoxx sterling benchmark index has widened since the start of the month from tights of 186bp to 194.8bp on Friday, on an asset swap basis, according to Thomson Reuters data. BOE BUYING BEGINS AS MARKET WOBBLES Ironically, the market's struggle comes as the Bank of England showed its firepower and revealed that it had bought £507m of corporate bonds in the first week of its programme.Over £9bn of investment-grade issuance has printed since the BoE announced its stimulus measures on August 4, as issuers and investor alike sought to take advantage of the opportunity.The central bank has been purchasing investment-grade corporate bonds in the secondary market since last Tuesday, as it looks to buy up to £10bn over the next 18 months via reverse auctions held every Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday.Some bankers remain hopeful that the BoE's influence will once again take hold next week, and say that a handful of corporates are waiting in the wings.""It's still an attractive currency for issuers, although we have started to see some decompression in spreads, and price tightening has been more tricky during marketing,"" one banker said.""But we're hopeful that issuers will take next weeks window as there is still interest.""Those planning sterling issuance in the coming weeks include Verizon, which has asked investors for feedback on possible eight-year and 12-year euro-denominated deals, and potentially a 20 to 30-year sterling bond, according to an investor who attended the London leg of the roadshow.

560,"   By Joseph Menn | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO An international civil liberties group that has worked with web companies on human rights and surveillance issues is asking Verizon Communications Inc to examine a secret email scanning program run by its acquisition target Yahoo Inc and improve on its user protection record.Access Now, an international digital rights group, wrote to Verizon on Tuesday about scanning conducted in 2015 at the behest of U.S. intelligence authorities and first reported by Reuters last week. Federal officials said the search was at the direction of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and sought emails containing a specific set of characters associated with a terror group backed by another government.Access Now pressed the communications carrier to make sure that Yahoo does more to protect user data, keeps security staff informed of relevant policy decisions and keeps its commitments to surveillance reform.""We have an ongoing and constructive engagement with Access Now and will review their recommendations and consider them carefully,"" Verizon said in an emailed statement.The letter, provided to Reuters in advance of its publication on Wednesday on the group's website, points to mixed feelings among privacy and security experts about the pending $4.8 billion acquisition.

If they believe that it's not then they'll need to show us that,"" he said, declining to comment on whether talks are under way to renegotiate the purchase price.Asked for comment, a Yahoo spokesman said: ""We are confident in Yahoo's value and we continue to work towards integration with Verizon.""The deal has a clause that says Verizon can withdraw if a new event ""reasonably can be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, assets, properties, results of operation or financial condition of the business.""Silliman said the U.S. Federal Trade Commission has approved Verizon's planned acquisition of Yahoo, but it still needs approval from the European Commission and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing the proxy.Verizon has had preliminary briefings from Yahoo but it still needs ""significant information"" from the company before it makes a final decision on the materiality of the hacking of at least 500 million email accounts, Silliman said. He said Verizon is ""absolutely evaluating (the breach) and will make determinations about whether and how to move forward with the deal based on our evaluation of the materiality.""Yahoo shares ended 1.75 percent lower at $41.62, while Verizon was largely unchanged, closing at $50.29, down 0.02 percent.Yahoo in September disclosed that it had fallen victim to a data breach in 2014 that compromised users' names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth and encrypted passwords. The company has said the cyber attack was carried out by a ""state-sponsored"" actor, but some private security experts have challenged that assertion.Several Democratic senators have pressed Yahoo to reveal more information about the hack and why it took so long to discover.The internet firm said it learned of the breach this summer while investigating claims of a separate intrusion, but it has not provided a specific timeline of events.Some analysts suggested Verizon may be trying to get a better price. Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics, said ""Verizon is rightfully upset about Yahoo not properly disclosing the breach.""He said Yahoo would most likely have to consider renegotiating the price with Verizon, if it came to that.""I don't think it has much of a choice. Who else would want to buy them?"" Entner said.Experts said bidders who try to extract themselves from mergers using the material adverse clause face an uphill battle. No U.S. company has ever invoked the clause successfully in court to get out of a deal.In 2013, Cooper Tire & Rubber company got cold feet about a $2.5 billion sale to Apollo Tyres and argued in the Delaware Court of Chancery that Apollo had seen a material adverse change related to union issues at a subsidiary of the company. The court rejected Cooper Tire's claims and the deal fell apart.A Delaware court ruled in 2001 that poultry producer Tyson Foods Inc could not terminate its merger with beef producer IBP Inc over accounting irregularities. The court said the shortfall was not due to a long-term problem.

The consolidation involves Verizon call centers near Rochester and Orangeburg, New York; Bangor, Maine; Lincoln, Nebraska; Wallingford and Meriden, Connecticut; and Rancho Cordoba, California, the company said.The proposed call center closures, which will impact 850 jobs in New York, drew a testy response from the office of New York's governor, Andrew Cuomo.

Todd | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Yahoo Inc reported better-than-expected quarterly adjusted profit on Tuesday, a boost for the beleaguered company whose deal to sell its core business to Verizon Communications Inc has been shaken by a massive data breach.Verizon's general counsel said last week that the hack, which affected at least 500 million email accounts in 2014, could have a material impact, possibly allowing Verizon to withdraw from the $4.83 billion deal.Tuesday's results provided at least an initial indication that the data breach has not led to a quick exodus of Yahoo customers, as some had feared. Customer trends showed growth in pageviews and email usage, Yahoo said.Still, analysts were split on whether the results dispelled doubts about the deal going through. Yahoo said in a filing with securities regulators shortly before the breach was disclosed that it knew of no cyber risks, raising questions about whether Verizon was informed of the breach in a timely fashion.  JMP Securities analyst Ronald Josey said it was too early to tell if the breach would cause lasting damage, and called customer trends ""encouraging.""""The message here is email and messaging is a very sticky product and people want to get to their messages,"" said Josey.But Fatemeh Khatibloo, a security analyst with Forrester Research, said the uptick in pageviews and email usage could be the result of ""500 million people trying to figure out if they're exposed.""Any loss of users in the future, lawsuits related to the breach and a pending Federal Communications Commission vote that could limit how telecommunications companies can use customer data may encourage Verizon to try and back out of the deal, said Khatibloo.However, Scott Kessler, an analyst with CFRA Research, said the fact that Yahoo did not see an immediate decline in users was a sign the breach may not be a material adverse change that would affect the Verizon deal. ""The bottom line here is from a fundamental operational and financial perspective, it doesn't seem like much has changed at the company over the last quarter,"" he said.Legal experts have said Verizon would have to clear a high hurdle to prove that the breach amounted to a material adverse change that would allow it to pull out of the deal.REVENUE CHALLENGES  Another positive sign for Yahoo was that revenue from Mavens - the mobile, video, native and social advertising units that Chief Executive Marissa Mayer touts as its emerging businesses - rose 24.2 percent to $524 million.Still, the business showed continuing declines in major revenue categories.

577,"   By Aishwarya Venugopal and Malathi Nayak  Verizon Communications Inc  added fewer than expected wireless subscribers in the third quarter due to intense competition, and indicated it may renegotiate a deal to buy Yahoo Inc after a breach of Yahoo user email accounts.As its bread-and-butter wireless operations struggle in a saturated phone market, Verizon had said in July it would buy Yahoo's core business for $4.83 billion to drive growth in advertising and media. The company said on Thursday total operating revenue in the quarter fell 6.7 percent to $30.94 billion, from $33.16 billion. Analysts had expected revenue of $31.14 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Shares of Verizon, the No.1 U.S. wireless company, slipped 2.7 percent to $49.04 in afternoon trading. The stock has gained more than 6 percent this year so far. Verizon added a net 442,000 retail postpaid subscribers, who pay their bills on a monthly basis. This was significantly below analysts' estimated 766,300, according to market research firm FactSet StreetAccount.Subscriber growth in the third quarter was partly hurt by a recent recall of the Samsung Note 7 smartphone due to the risk of overheating and catching fire, and a backlog in orders for Apple's new iPhone 7, Verizon executives said.  Smaller rivals, such as T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp, have rolled out aggressive promotions to win over Verizon's subscriber base. YAHOO DEAL  To fend off rivals in a maturing wireless market, it acquired AOL in 2015. Verizon's planned purchase of Yahoo will give it digital web properties and ad technology tools, allowing it to compete with internet giants like Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google.   ""It will take years to find out if their advertising strategy pans out,"" MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett said in a note. Verizon's general counsel has said that a Yahoo data breach reported in September, which involved 500 million email accounts, was a material event that could allow Verizon to back out of the deal. Verizon was still evaluating what the data breach may mean for the Yahoo transaction, Verizon's Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said in an interview.""We're going to have to wait to see and get the facts...before any final decision is made,"" Shammo said.Net income attributable to Verizon fell to $3.62 billion, or 89 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, from $4.04 billion, or 99 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, the company earned $1.01 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 99 cents per share.

578,"   By Dion Rabouin | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The euro fell to a four-month low against the U.S. dollar on Thursday and the greenback rose to its highest in seven months against a basket of major currencies after the European Central Bank President left the door open to more monetary stimulus.The rise in the U.S. dollar knocked down oil prices which are traded in dollars and pressured U.S. stock prices.The ECB left its ultra-loose monetary policy unchanged but President Mario Draghi kept a wide range of options open for further stimulus in December, shooting down any talk of tapering its 1.7 trillion euro asset-buying program.The U.S. dollar gained further after publication of a stronger-than-expected U.S. existing home sales report.""The move in the dollar hurt oil, which hurt energy, which hurt stocks,"" said Stephen Guilfoyle, chief market economist at Stuart Frankel & Co.Crude oil prices fell just under 2.5 percent, also weighed by profit taking. A strong rally on Wednesday had taken prices to their highest in 15 months in the wake of unexpected inventory drawdowns.U.S. stocks were also pushed lower by weak earnings reports from index heavyweights such as telephone service provider Verizon Communications Inc  and insurer Travelers Companies, Inc . Telecom stocks were the worst-performing sector, down 2 percent, their worst one-day percentage drop since Sept. 9.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 40.27 points, or 0.22 percent, to 18,162.35. The S&P 500 lost 2.95 points, or 0.14 percent, to 2,141.34 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 4.58 points, or 0.09 percent, to 5,241.83. A measure of world equity markets .MIWD00000PUS fell 0.14 percent after touching a fresh one-week high following Draghi's comments.European equities jumped following Draghi's remarks, with the pan-European STOXX 600 index rising more than 1.0 percent from its lows before closing up 0.19 percent.DRAGHI DRAGS DOWN EURO  The euro fell as low as $1.0916 versus the U.S. dollar, its lowest since June 24, helping the dollar index rise to its highest since March 10.""Draghi pushed back strongly against the idea that they could discuss tapering or adjusting QE and that weighed on the euro,"" said Vassili Serebriakov, FX strategist at Credit Agricole in New York.The ECB head's comments weighed on longer-dated U.S. Treasury prices, which dipped modestly. Benchmark 10-year notes were last down 1/32 in price to yield 1.749 percent.The greenback was also supported by relatively hawkish comments by New York Fed President William Dudley late on Wednesday. Dudley, a permanent voter on policy and a close ally of Fed Chair Janet Yellen, said the U.S. central bank would likely raise interest rates later this year if the U.S. economy remained on track.The Mexican peso fell on Thursday after touching a six-week high in the immediate aftermath of the U.S. presidential debate between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton on Wednesday.The peso is seen as the chief proxy for market pricing of the Republican candidate's chances in view of his promises to impose tough limits on immigration and rewrite trade deals.""The early polls suggest Clinton was once again the winner here and so the Mexican peso has been one of the most obvious beneficiaries,"" said James Athey, fixed income investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management.""The magnitude of the move, however, suggests that the market has largely concluded that Trump won't win. That doesn't mean that the result is a foregone conclusion. Markets, pollsters and pundits all predicted the wrong result in the UK's referendum on EU membership. That should act as a cursory lesson now.""

The company added fewer than expected wireless subscribers in the third quarter and revenue fell short of expectations. But a 10.3 percent jump in AmEx helped offset the decline after the credit card issuer posted strong quarterly results and boosted its 2016 forecast.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 16.88 points, or 0.09 percent, to 18,185.74, the S&P 500 lost 2.39 points, or 0.11 percent, to 2,141.9 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 7.62 points, or 0.15 percent, to 5,238.79.The S&P 500 has struggled in recent sessions to climb above its technical resistance level at the 100-day moving average, which currently stands at 2,142.60.

580,"   By Aishwarya Venugopal and Malathi Nayak  Verizon Communications Inc  added fewer than expected wireless subscribers in the third quarter due to intense competition, and indicated it may renegotiate a deal to buy Yahoo Inc after a breach of Yahoo user email accounts.As its bread-and-butter wireless operations struggle in a saturated phone market, Verizon had said in July it would buy Yahoo's core business for $4.83 billion to drive growth in advertising and media. The company said on Thursday total operating revenue in the quarter fell 6.7 percent to $30.94 billion, from $33.16 billion. Analysts had expected revenue of $31.14 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Shares of Verizon, the No.1 U.S. wireless company, slipped 2.7 percent to $49.04 in afternoon trading. The stock has gained more than 6 percent this year so far. Verizon added a net 442,000 retail postpaid subscribers, who pay their bills on a monthly basis. This was significantly below analysts' estimated 766,300, according to market research firm FactSet StreetAccount.Subscriber growth in the third quarter was partly hurt by a recent recall of the Samsung Note 7 smartphone due to the risk of overheating and catching fire, and a backlog in orders for Apple's new iPhone 7, Verizon executives said.  Smaller rivals, such as T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp, have rolled out aggressive promotions to win over Verizon's subscriber base. YAHOO DEAL  To fend off rivals in a maturing wireless market, it acquired AOL in 2015. Verizon's planned purchase of Yahoo will give it digital web properties and ad technology tools, allowing it to compete with internet giants like Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google.   ""It will take years to find out if their advertising strategy pans out,"" MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett said in a note. Verizon's general counsel has said that a Yahoo data breach reported in September, which involved 500 million email accounts, was a material event that could allow Verizon to back out of the deal. Verizon was still evaluating what the data breach may mean for the Yahoo transaction, Verizon's Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said in an interview.""We're going to have to wait to see and get the facts...before any final decision is made,"" Shammo said.Net income attributable to Verizon fell to $3.62 billion, or 89 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, from $4.04 billion, or 99 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, the company earned $1.01 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 99 cents per share.

585,"   By Aishwarya Venugopal  T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) raised its forecast for customer additions for the year and Chief Executive John Legere said AT&T Inc's (T.N) proposed plan to buy Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) could help T-Mobile to carve out more market share.AT&T on Saturday proposed to buy Time Warner for $85.4 billion in a bid to acquire content to stream over its network to attract a growing number of online viewers.""I would say the great news is (AT&T is) going to be further unfocused than they are now and the upside opportunity to continue to acquire businesses in the space for us is tremendous,"" T-Mobile CEO John Legere said.T-Mobile, the No. 3 U.S. wireless carrier, and smaller rival Sprint Corp (S.N) have been grabbing market share by gaining subscribers from market leaders AT&T and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) through heavy discounting and promotions.Legere also said he does not expect regulators to allow AT&T to exclusively deliver Time Warner's content.""AT&T may end up being a provider to us of content as opposed to anybody thinking that there is any possibility that they will exclusively use that content,"" Legere said on a call with analysts. Shares of T-Mobile, controlled by Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE), were up 7.44 at $50.22 in midday trading after touching a nine-year high of $50.41.""We see no need for T-Mobile or Sprint to do anything as a result of (AT&T's) announcement and instead to keep doing what they are doing and that's steal share from AT&T and Verizon,"" Cowen and Company analyst Colby Synesael said in a client note.T-Mobile US said it now expected to add 3.7-3.9 million branded postpaid customers, or customers who pay monthly bills, on a net basis this year, higher than its previous forecast of 3.4-3.8 million. The company added 969,000 postpaid customers in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, up from 890,000 in the second quarter.In contrast, AT&T lost customers in the quarter, while Verizon's subscriber addition was well below analysts' estimates.T-Mobile said it benefited from the launch of Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iPhone 7 and an increase in branded prepaid customer migrating to postpaid plans. T-Mobile's net income surged to $366 million from $138 million, helped by after-tax spectrum gains of $122 million.On an adjusted basis, it earned 27 cents per share. Total revenue rose 17.8 percent to $9.25 billion.Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 22 cents per share and revenue of $9.42 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Wells Fargo said the slight revenue miss was due to lower-than-expected equipment revenue partly due to T-Mobile's ""free"" iPhone 7 promotion.

586,"   By Tim McLaughlin and Ross Kerber | BOSTON  BOSTON Many actively managed U.S. mutual funds were cool toward AT&T Inc even before the telecom giant's planned $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc.The chilly attitude from professional stock pickers partly explains the lackluster reception for AT&T's planned takeover of Time Warner. Large-cap growth funds, for example, prefer tech companies whose operations require less capital than a regulated telecom operator like AT&T. Even a major benefit to owning AT&T - its juicy 5 percent-plus dividend yield - is a cause for investor concern as higher interest rates may make the return look less attractive.“There will be more options available for other, higher-yielding assets if rates are going up,” said Carrie Tallman, director of research at Parsec Financial, a North Carolina financial adviser that owns shares of AT&T and Time Warner.Approval of AT&T's proposed takeover has provoked broad skepticism as the deal faces some of the toughest regulatory scrutiny in recent U.S. history of mergers and acquisitions.""We are committed to our dividend and to maintaining the financial flexibility for the board to consider future growth in the dividend,"" AT&T spokeswoman Emily Edmonds said in email. “On Saturday we announced we’ll increase our quarterly dividend for the 33rd straight year, even as we announced we’ve secured a $40 billion bridge facility to finance our acquisition of Time Warner.” HUNT FOR YIELD Meanwhile, seven out of AT&T's 10 largest fund investors are passive index funds, which are obligated to buy the stock because they track the S&P 500 Index, or other benchmarks that count AT&T as a component. Overall, more than 600 index funds own nearly 13 percent of AT&T's shares, according to Thomson Reuters data. That is more than actively managed income, value and growth funds combined, which hold about 8 percent of AT&T shares.  By contrast, those types of actively managed funds hold nearly 18 percent of the shares of rival Verizon Communications Inc, according to Thomson Reuters data. Large-cap growth portfolio managers like Fidelity Contrafund's Will Danoff see AT&T as a regulated, capital intensive, slow growth company. Danoff, who oversees about $109 billion for the fund, does not own any AT&T shares, telling investors in recent commentary he has largely avoided telecom stocks.Only 21 out of 181 large-cap growth funds tracked by Lipper Inc held AT&T shares. During the first half of this year, not owning AT&T hurt these funds' relative performance to the S&P 500 because the stock surged 26 percent.  Retail investors piled into AT&T as the hunt for yield intensified against a backdrop of historically low interest rates. AT&T's current dividend yield is 5.3 percent on an annualized basis.    Matthew Benkendorf, chief investment officer of Vontobel Asset Management, a subadviser to Virtus mutual funds, said low rates have undoubtedly driven increased interest in stocks like AT&T. But in recent months, as higher U.S. interest rates appear more likely, AT&T shares have been under pressure. The stock is off 14 percent in the past three months, reflecting interest rate concerns and Saturday's announcement of the Time Warner deal.Questions for investors now include whether Time Warner's TV and film assets can deliver meaningful growth for AT&T, and whether the new conglomerate will continue to satisfy an important base of investors with a healthy dividend payout.Vontobel's Benkendorf said an added wrinkle to those questions is the sustainability of the dividend AT&T is paying. ""That is a real question for them,"" he said.

588,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 26 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating to Verizon  Communications Inc.'s (Verizon; NYSE: VZ) multi-tranche offering of Euro and  Sterling senior unsecured notes. Proceeds will be used for general corporate  purposes, including the acquisitions of Fleetmatics Group PLC and XO Holdings'  wireline assets as well as for the potential repayment of debt, depending on  market conditions. Verizon's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is 'A-' and  the Rating Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS Competitive Position: The ratings are supported by Verizon Wireless's (VZW)  strong competitive position, as evidenced through industry-low churn rates, high  margins and the extensive coverage of approximately 98% of the U.S. population  with its 4G LTE network. These factors are balanced against moderately high  leverage for the rating, which stems from the February 2014 acquisition of the  remaining 45% stake in VZW. Core Telecom Leverage: At Sept. 30, 2016, core telecom leverage was 2.4x and  total adjusted debt/EBITDAR was 2.9x. Including the Yahoo acquisition and other  pending acquisitions, Fitch expects Verizon's core telecom leverage to decline  to approximately 2.2x by 2017 while total adjusted debt/EBITDAR is expected to  approximate 2.8x. Core telecom leverage excludes securitizations (both  off-balance-sheet and public/144A and on-balance-sheet asset-backed  securitizations). Securitizations are included in total adjusted debt/EBITDAR  measures. Pending Acquisitions: In July 2016, Verizon announced a definitive agreement  with Yahoo! Inc. (Yahoo) whereby it will acquire the subsidiaries holding  Yahoo's operating businesses for approximately $4.83 billion in a cash  transaction (subject to closing adjustments). In September 2016, Yahoo disclosed  that a copy of certain information related to approximately 500 million user  accounts was stolen; this could have a material adverse effect on the  transaction and Verizon is evaluating the impact of the event on the  transaction. The transaction is expected to close in early 2017, following  customary approvals including approvals by regulators and Yahoo's shareholders.  Verizon's acquisition of XO Communications' (XO) fiber network business for  approximately $1.8 billion is expected to close by the end of the first quarter  of 2017 (1Q17). In August 2016, the acquisition of telematics provider  Fleetmatics for $2.4 billion was announced, and the transaction is expected to  close by the end of 2016. Wireline Asset Sale: In April 2016, Verizon completed the sale of its wireline  operations in California, Texas and Florida to Frontier Communications Corp.  (Frontier) for pre-tax proceeds of $10.5 billion. Approximately $600 million of  debt transferred with the subsidiaries. In April 2016, Verizon used the $10.5  billion in pre-tax proceeds and cash on hand to tender for and redeem early  $10.7 billion in existing debt.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Fitch assumes Verizon's EBITDA grows below 1% in 2016 over 2015. Fitch expects  midsingle digit EBITDA growth in 2017, based on organic revenue growth slightly  below Fitch's expectations for domestic GDP growth plus the effect of  acquisitions. --Debt reduction in the core business, combined with EBITDA growth, is expected  to reduce core telecom leverage to the low 2x range by 2017/2018. --VZW will continue to generate strong free cash flow (FCF) on an operational  basis. VZW's simple FCF (EBITDA less capital spending) for the latest 12 months  (LTM) ended Sept. 30, 2016, was approximately $28.5 billion. --In 2016, Fitch expects consolidated capital spending to be at the low end of  company guidance of $17.2 billion to $17.7 billion. Investment in the wireless  network continues to be an area of emphasis due to the strong demand for 4G LTE  capacity for rapidly growing data services. --Fitch has included modest spending on spectrum in the FCC's 600 MHz TV  broadcast auction, currently underway. Spectrum spending approaching or  exceeding levels spent in the AWS-3 auction will be an event-driven  consideration.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive Rating Action: Fitch believes a positive rating action is unlikely in  the foreseeable future, given current levels of leverage. Negative Rating Action: Fitch may take a negative rating action if operating  performance causes deleveraging to take place at a materially  slower-than-anticipated pace, either alone or in combination with material  debt-financed acquisitions. Discretionary management moves that cause leverage  to rise above 2.5x, such as another material acquisition or stock repurchases,  could lead to a negative action in the absence of a strong commitment to  deleverage. LIQUIDITY Strong Liquidity Profile: Verizon's liquidity is supported by its reported  consolidated cash balances, which were $6.4 billion at Sept. 30, 2016, and by  its undrawn revolving credit facility (RCF). In 3Q16, Verizon amended its RCF, increasing its availability to $9 billion from  $8 billion and extending its maturity to September 2020 from July 2018. Fitch  expects Verizon to maintain aggregate commercial paper (CP) balances within a  level fully backed by the RCF. The credit facility has no ratings triggers or  other restrictive financial covenants, such as leverage or interest coverage  tests. Verizon's cash from operations in 2016 will be negatively affected by certain  items. The company will incur higher cash taxes on a business-as-usual basis as  the cash tax rate moves toward the effective tax rate and by the cash tax  payment arising from the gain on sale of the wireline assets to Frontier.  Additionally, wireless handset financing under the equipment installment  programs will pressure cash from operations, as the public securitizations  funding handset sales beginning in the third quarter of 2016 will be recorded in  cash from financing activities. This is a change in presentation from the  private securitizations undertaken in 2015 and 1Q16, which were recorded in  operating activities. Further, cash from operations in 2015 was also boosted on  a non-recurring basis by the portion of the tower sale proceeds (approximately  $2.4 billion) recorded in operating activities. Debt Maturities: On a consolidated basis, as of Sept. 30, 2016, Verizon and its  subsidiaries had no material maturities remaining in 2016, and expected debt  maturities of approximately $3.8 billion in 2017.

594,"   By Malathi Nayak and Rishika Sadam  U.S. satellite TV operator Dish Network Corp (DISH.O) reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday as it lost more pay-TV subscribers due to stiff competition from online video services.Shares in Dish were up about 1.5 percent at $57.56 in early-afternoon trading after paring earlier losses.Dish said it posted a smaller-than-expected loss of 116,000 pay-TV subscribers on a net basis in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, compared to a loss of 23,000 subscribers a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected a decline of 142,000, according to market research firm FactSet StreetEstimate. Dish's pay-TV subscriber numbers include satellite TV and its online streaming service, Sling TV.The company's satellite TV service, its mainstay, has been under pressure as more customers shift to online streaming services such as Netflix (NFLX.O) and ditch traditional cable, a trend known as ""cord-cutting"".  Sling TV is expected to face tough competition from AT&T's upcoming DirecTV Now streaming video service and Hulu's live online TV service that is expected to launch next year, analysts say.Last year, Dish launched Sling TV, a cheaper online streaming service with a slim bundle of channels, including live programing from networks such as ESPN. A monthly Sling TV subscription costs $20 for 28 channels and $40 for over 50 channels.AT&T Inc (T.N), which announced plans to buy Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) last month for $85.4 billion, plans to launch DirecTV Now in late November. It will cost $35 per month, including mobile streaming costs, and have over 100 channels.  Dish will have to invest more on marketing Sling TV and ""do creative deals"" with content owners to compete, Recon Analytics analyst Roger Entner said.Dish has amassed a treasure trove of wireless spectrum in recent years that analysts have valued at nearly $45 billion. The company has been long considered an acquisition target for AT&T or Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) to boost their wireless networks. AT&T's Time Warner deal ""presumably takes AT&T out of the running as a potential suitor,"" MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett said in a note on Wednesday. Net income attributable to Dish rose to $307 million, or 64 cents per share, in the third quarter, from $196 million, or 42 cents per share, a year earlier.Total revenue rose slightly to $3.75 billion from $3.73 billion.Analysts on average had expected a profit of 68 cents per share and revenue of $3.74 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

595,"   By Jennifer Saba | NEW YORK  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Yahoo is hacking out more wiggle room for Verizon. The beleaguered internet firm waited until the day after the U.S. election to reveal a hacker's July claim to have certain user data. That's when it inked a $4.8 billion sale to the telecommunications giant. The latest hit to Yahoo's reputation gives Verizon extra firepower to snag a better deal.The company led by Marissa Mayer said in a regulatory filing late Wednesday that it investigated the data thief's allegations and found it could not substantiate them. The time frame, though, only begs more questions. Yahoo agreed to sell its advertising and search units to Verizon on July 25. At the time, the company noted there were no material adverse effects on its businesses, although certain language in the merger agreement addresses security breaches and unauthorized access that gives Verizon a degree of protection.  Then in September Yahoo dropped a cyber bombshell by admitting that certain information was stolen from at least 500 million user accounts in 2014. That prompted Marni Walden, Verizon's president of innovation and new business, to stress that the company would ""protect our shareholders and our investors, so we're not going to jump off a cliff blindly."" Now it turns out that Yahoo discovered the huge breach after it started an investigation to delve into the previously undisclosed July allegation. Yahoo stands by its statement that the breach of 500 million accounts has not had a material effect on its business. That said, the company has ""subsequently incurred expenses"" related to the hack and it expects to incur ""investigatory, legal, and other expenses"" associated with it in the foreseeable future, the filing points out without providing a figure.Both sides are already in talks to try and determine how much this has hurt Yahoo's value, never mind its ever-dwindling reputation. Wednesday's revelation should give Verizon an additional cudgel at the negotiating table.

602,"  Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier, is selling 29 data centers in the United States and Latin America to Equinix Inc (EQIX.O) for $3.6 billion, as the telecom giant focuses on its core business.The data centers being sold are located in 15 metro areas, including New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Bogota and Sao Paulo.The sale represents Verizon's efforts to streamline its business and follows the divestment last year of a chunk of its landline business and a portfolio of wireless towers.The enterprise telecommunications industry has had to adapt in recent years to corporate customers seeking more sophisticated and cheaper offerings to manage their data.Verizon, which bought data center company Terremark Worldwide for $1.4 billion in 2011, has been facing stiff competition from companies such as T-Mobile US Inc TMUS.N and Sprint Corp (S.N), which offer deep discounts on cellphone and data plans.Verizon has pivoted to mobile video and advertising by making high-profile acquisitions - it is buying Yahoo for $4.83 billion, and had picked up AOL for $4.4 billion last year. Reuters reported earlier this year that Verizon had launched an auction to sell the data center assets.The company said about 250 Verizon employees, mainly in the operations functions of the acquired data centers, will become Equinix employees.For Equinix, the world's biggest provider of data centers, the acquisition further bolsters its presence in the Americas. ""We've been looking at these assets for a long time ...(they) check a number of strategic boxes for us,"" Equinix Americas President Karl Strohmeyer said in a call with analysts.The acquired portfolio includes about 900 customers, bringing Equinix's total number of data centers to 175 in 43 markets. Equinix was advised by Evercore, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP.Citi and Guggenheim Partners were financial advisers to Verizon, while Jones Day provided legal counsel to Verizon.Shares of Equinix were up 1.8 percent at $337.98, while Verizon was little changed in early trading.

603,"   By Claire Ruckin | LONDON  LONDON US data center operator Equinix (EQIX.O) has doubled the size of a leveraged loan it is raising to back its acquisition of data centers from Verizon Communications (VZ.N), increasing it to €1bn and tightening pricing following overwhelming investor demand, banking sources said on Wednesday.The company announced earlier this month it would acquire 29 data centers in the US and Latin America for US$3.6bn.Equinix originally planned to back the acquisition with a €500m term loan and a mix of equity and bonds. The increase in the term loan will mean the company will now purchase the data centers with less equity and bonds, the sources said. Bank of America Merrill Lynch leads the financing, with the €1bn term loan B now offered at par, compared to a 99.75 OID guided at launch. An interest margin of 325bp over Euribor and a 0% floor remain unchanged.

604,"   By Greg Roumeliotis and Jessica Toonkel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) came under renewed scrutiny by federal investigators and lawmakers on Thursday after disclosing the largest known data breach in history, prompting Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) to demand better terms for its planned purchase of Yahoo's internet business.Shares of the Sunnyvale, California-based internet pioneer fell more than 6 percent after it announced the breach of data belonging to more than 1 billion users late on Wednesday, following another large hack reported in September.Verizon, which agreed to buy Yahoo's core internet business in July for $4.8 billion, is now trying to persuade Yahoo to amend the terms of the acquisition agreement to reflect the economic damage from the two hacks, according to people familiar with the matter.The U.S. No. 1 wireless carrier still expects to go through with the deal, but is looking for “major concessions” in light of the most recent breach, according to another person familiar with the situation.Asked about the status of the deal, a Yahoo spokesperson said: ""We are confident in Yahoo’s value and we continue to work towards integration with Verizon.""Verizon had already said in October it was reviewing the deal after September's breach disclosure. Late on Wednesday, it said it would ""review the impact of this new development before reaching any final conclusions"" about whether to proceed. The company declined to comment beyond that statement on Thursday. Verizon has threatened to go to court to get out of the deal if it is not repriced, citing a material adverse effect, said the people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential.No court in Delaware, where Yahoo is incorporated, has ever found that a material adverse effect has occurred that would allow companies to terminate a merger agreement. Nevertheless, the threat of a court case on the issue has been successfully used by companies to renegotiate deals, and experts said that some concessions from Yahoo are likely, given the magnitude of the cyber security breaches. Renegotiating the deal’s price tag would be the simplest but also least likely scenario because the impact of the data breaches will not be apparent for some time, according to Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. A more likely concession would be for Yahoo to agree to compensate Verizon after the close of the deal, based on the liabilities that occur. The two companies may also agree to extend the close of the deal to allow for more time for information to come in on the impact of the breaches, Gordon suggested.Verizon shares rose 0.4 percent to close at $51.81, in line with the S&P 500 Index .SPX. Yahoo closed down 6.1 percent at $38.41. BIGGEST BREACH  Yahoo said late on Wednesday that it had uncovered a 2013 cyber attack that compromised data of more than 1 billion user accounts, the largest known breach on record.  It said the data stolen may have included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers.The company added that some of its partners were affected. One such partner, Europe's Sky Plc (SKYB.L), said Yahoo provides email services to its 2.1 million Sky.com email account holders, but it was unclear how many of those accounts were affected. The announcement followed Yahoo's disclosure in September of a separate breach that affected over 500 million accounts, which the company said it believed was launched by different hackers. The White House said on Thursday the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation was probing the breach. Several lawsuits seeking class-action status on behalf of Yahoo shareholders have been filed, or are in the works.Meanwhile, Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia said he was looking into Yahoo's cyber security practices. ""This most-recent revelation warrants a separate follow-up and I plan to press the company on why its cyber defenses have been so weak as to have compromised over a billion users,"" he said in a statement.Warner, who will become the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee next year, described the hacks as ""deeply troubling."" New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman urged anyone with a Yahoo account to change their passwords and security questions and said he is examining the breach's circumstances and the company's disclosures to law enforcement. Germany's cyber security authority, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), advised German consumers to consider switching to safer alternatives for email, and criticized Yahoo for failing to adopt modern encryption techniques to protect users' personal data.""Considering the repeated cases of data theft, users should look more closely at which services they want to use in the future and security should play a part in that decision,"" BSI President Arne Schoenbohm said in a statement.The latest breach drew widespread criticism from security experts, several advising consumers to close their Yahoo accounts.""Yahoo has fallen down on security in so many ways I have to recommend that if you have an active Yahoo email account, either direct with Yahoo of via a partner like AT&T, get rid of it,"" Stu Sjouwerman, chief executive of cyber security firm KnowBe4 Inc, said in a broadly distributed email. A Yahoo spokesperson, in response to criticism of the company's security measures, said on Thursday: ""We’re committed to keeping our users secure, both by continuously striving to stay ahead of ever-evolving online threats and to keep our users and platforms secure.""
