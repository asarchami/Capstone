0,"  May 15 Waste management company Shanks Group Plc  posted a 4 percent rise in full-year revenue, driven by growth in its Hazardous Waste and UK Municipal businesses.Shanks, which sorts and reprocesses commercial, industrial and construction waste to produce usable fuel, fertilizers and other energy products, said Solid Waste Benelux - its biggest division by revenue - clocked profit growth for the first time in five years. Revenue excluding discontinued operations rose to 636.4 million pounds ($1.1 billion) in the full year ended March 31 from 614.6 million pounds a year earlier. It was up only 1 percent at constant currency.  An exit from its underperformining UK Solid Waste business helped reported underlying pretax profit rise 14 percent to 30.2 million pounds, Shanks said.

9,"  FRANKFURT Jan 28 Several Chinese companies are fighting over German waste management company Energy from Waste (EEW) in a deal potentially worth about 1.8 billion euros ($1.96 billion), several people familiar with the matter said.Among those groups, handing in final bids on Monday will be Chinese groups that have entered or re-entered the race in its final stage, they said.Beijing Enterprise, China Tianying a consortium comprising Beijing Capital and German utility Steag as well as Finnish utility Fortum are expected to hand in offers. Beijing Capital Group had initially dropped out of the race alongside China Everbright as their offers came in below the cut-off price of 1.7 billion euros, while Tianying had not been on the original shortlist.EQT as well as the bidders declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment outside regular office hours. For 2015, EEW is expected to post core earnings, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation, of 190 million euros. If the final enterprise value - including stakes of minority shareholders - remains at more than 1.8 billion euros that would be roughly in line with the 9 times core earnings that China's Cheung Kong Infrastructure paid for AVR when it bought the Dutch energy-from-waste company in 2013.EEW's private equity owner EQT as well as the bidders declined to comment, except for Beijing Enterprises and Beijing Capital which were not immediately available for comment.

11,"   By Arno Schuetze | FRANKFURT  FRANKFURT Beijing Enterprise (0392.HK) is buying German waste management company Energy from Waste (EEW) for 1.4 billion euros ($1.6 billion) as China sets about tackling its pollution and waste recycling problems. The largest Chinese acquisition of a German company to date comes just weeks after ChemChina's acquisition of German industrial machinery maker KraussMaffei and underlines China's interest in German know-how.China set a target to spend about $16 billion between 2013 and 2016 to improve sewage disposal and garbage treatment as the government struggles to find ways of treating the enormous amounts of refuse the world's most populous country generates.ChemChina grabbed headlines on Wednesday with what would be China's largest ever overseas acquisition, a $43 billion bid for seeds and pesticides group Syngenta.Sources familiar with the EEW transaction said it valued the German company at 1.8 billion euros, including debt. This marks a healthy return for buyout group EQT, which bought EEW at a valuation of about 1.15 billion euros, acquiring half of the business in 2012 at a 1 billion euros valuation and the rest last year at 1.3 billion euros.The acquisition is significant for China, as government researchers have estimated as much as 7 billion tonnes of waste is buried around China's major cities, and the capital Beijing is now surrounded by a belt of landfill sites known disparagingly as the ""seventh ring road"".To ease the problem, China aims to convert 30 percent of its rubbish to electricity by 2030, up from less than 5 percent now. However, plans to build waste-to-energy plants have routinely been opposed by residents alarmed by pollution risks. EEW has state-of-the-art emissions control technology and an efficient garbage collection management system. It has long-term contracts for accepting waste and for delivering energy and heat. Like energy grids or pipelines, it generates stable returns, making it attractive to waste management firms.In a rare bidding war between Chinese groups for an overseas asset, Beijing Enterprise outbid a consortium of China Tianying (000035.SZ) and Ping An (2318.HK), a consortium of Beijing Capital (600008.SS) and German utility Steag, as well as Finnish utility Fortum (FUM1V.HE).""Bids came in very close, the offer price of the runner-up was just two percent below that of the winner,"" a person familiar with the deal said.  For 2015, EEW is expected to post earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization of 190 million euros.

19,"   By David Randall | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The strong jobs market is likely to send sales higher at retailers and restaurants but leave investors unhappy, worrying fund managers who have crowded into consumer stocks.Wage increases, driven by higher minimum wages and greater competition for employees, are squeezing margins, forcing companies to eat higher labor costs while also investing in technology in hopes of saving money over time, investors and analysts said. Consumer company shares fell more than 1 percent Wednesday after heavyweights Walt Disney Co and Macy's Inc missed analyst estimates and retailer Ross Stores was downgraded. Companies ranging from hotel operator Marriott International Inc to Papa John’s International Inc to Big Five Sports Goods Corp have told analysts over the last three weeks that they are seeing an impact from higher wages, especially at entry-level positions that are the most affected by increases in the minimum wage.  Marriott told analyst it expected wage growth of 3 to 5 percent in the United States over the next couple of years, requiring the company to raise revenues per room 3 percent just to keep flat margins. ""In terms of earnings growth, it will be more difficult to identify margin expansion stories than it was a couple of years ago,” said Matt Kaufler, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors.“We’re now looking for companies that have some good or service where they can take the price up and not harm demand,” he said, citing portfolio holdings such as Waste Management Inc.  Overall, fund managers remain overweight consumer discretionary stocks such as Home Depot Inc and McDonald's Corp that have large workforces made up of entry-level labor. The average U.S. actively managed large cap fund now has 14.7 percent in the sector, compared with its 11.2 percent weighting in the Standard & Poor's 500 index, according to Lipper data. There are no easy answers for consumer discretionary companies facing rising labors costs, said Peter Saleh, an analyst at BTIG. ""If you wind up taking too much price, it could impact your traffic and it will impact your stock price,"" he said.  Some companies appear resigned to lower margins. ""Our largest expense is store labor, and a significant portion of this is part-time,"" said Barry Emerson, chief financial officer at Big 5 Sporting Goods, on a call with analysts after the company's earnings results. ""We'll continue to evaluate that store-staffing model and try and make adjustments as we can. But ... you've got to make sure you're running the cash register.
