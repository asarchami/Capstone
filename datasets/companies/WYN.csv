0,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, February 18 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) for Wyndham Worldwide Corp. (Wyndham) at 'BBB-'. Fitch has also  assigned a short-term IDR of 'F3' to Wyndham Global Finance PLC (WFG). The  Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of  the release.  WGF is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wyndham Worldwide Corp. through which the  company issues commercial paper (CP) in Europe. Notes issued by WFG are  unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by Wyndham. The ratings reflect Wyndham's strong free cash flow (FCF) profile, the majority  of which is made up of recurring fee income generated by its lodging, vacation  exchange and rental and time share segments. The ratings also consider  management's public commitment to maintaining investment-grade credit metrics. Elevated leverage for the 'BBB-' category remains Fitch's primary credit  concern, in the context of Wyndham's high exposure to the cyclical lodging and  timeshare industries and an increase in the company's contractual and contingent  off-balance-sheet obligations. STRONG FCF GENERATION Wyndham has consistently generated strong annual FCF since implementing more  efficient capital allocation policies in 2008 in connection with the previous  recession. The company generated FCF after dividends of $614 million during  2013, roughly 21.3% of its total core debt balance (unadjusted and excludes  securitized debt). Fitch expects FCF/debt will remain above 17% over the next  one to three years - a moderately lower rate primarily due to dividend  increases. ASSET-LIGHT/FEE-DRIVEN FOCUS Fitch's expectation is that management will continue to focus on asset-light  alternatives in the timeshare segment (e.g. Wyndham Asset Affiliation Model   and management fee revenue) in addition to maintaining its current  asset-light, fee-driven lodging and vacation exchange and rentals models.  Wyndham generates approximately 60% of its total revenues (and a greater  percentage of its profits) from recurring fees associated with its lodging  franchise and vacation rentals and exchange businesses, as well as management  fees from timeshare communities. Vacation interval shares (e.g. timeshare) make  up the majority of the balance. The ratings reflect the company's strategic purchase and ongoing ownership of  two hotel properties that are part of mixed-use developments that include  lodging and timeshare. Fitch expects the franchising of its hotel brands to  remain Wyndham's primary focus with hotel ownership representing a very small  component of its overall strategy. POSITIVE LODGING FUNDAMENTALS Wyndham's lodging business primarily includes franchising midscale and economy  hotel brands in the U.S. (roughly 80% of its room system at Dec. 31, 2013). U.S.  demand trends remain strong, although growth is moderating as the current  lodging cycle matures. Fitch expects 2014 to be another good year for the U.S.  lodging industry, with RevPAR growth of 5.5%, above the 3% long-term industry  average. U.S. RevPAR grew 5.4%, 6.8%, and 8.2% in 2013, 2012, and 2011,  respectively, according to STR Global. Fitch expects Wyndham's RevPAR to grow slightly below the industry average rate  at this stage of the lodging cycle, as hotels in the mid- to lower-end segments  generally have less pricing power than ones in the upper-scale segments. Strong occupancy rates and low supply growth are supporting greater pricing  power within the U.S. lodging industry, in general. Supply growth has passed its  trough, averaging 0.5% and 0.7% in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Fitch expects  U.S. hotel supply to accelerate to 1.1% during 2014, but remain comfortably  below the 2% annual industry average since 1988. DIFFERENTIATED SEGMENT: EXCHANGE & RENTALS Fitch views Wyndham's vacation exchange and rentals segment as a modest credit  positive that distinguishes it from the traditional businesses of other  high-profile lodging companies. Vacation exchange and rentals make up roughly  30% of the company's revenue and EBITDA and is predominantly fee-driven, with  the exception of a small portion of owned/leased properties on the rentals side.  This segment provides stability to the business profile as it had less severe  declines during the past recession (8.5%) compared to both the lodging and  timeshare segments. In addition, it has a fairly flexible cost structure  allowing for easier cost reductions during a downturn. Scale represents a significant barrier to entry in the vacation exchange  industry given the large number of resorts needed to make it an attractive  exchange network. The industry structure is essentially a duopoly between  Wyndham's vacation exchange business, RCI, and Interval Leisure Group, Inc. RCI  is the larger of the two, with over 4,000 vacation ownership resorts in its  network compared to Interval's roughly 2,800 resorts. Exposure to Europe and its small ownership position in several assets slightly  elevate the near-term business risk in Wyndham's rentals business, in Fitch's  view. However, the company is progressing in its efforts to apply the dynamic  revenue management concepts from its lodging and exchange businesses to improve  the pricing and margins for Wyndham and its customers over the cycle.  Fitch views vacation rentals as an attractive fee-for-service business that  complements Wyndham's other hospitality businesses from a longer-term  perspective. The company has a strong competitive position, which should allow  it to capitalize on consolidation opportunities in the fragmented rentals  industry. Fitch expects smaller 'bolt-on' acquisitions to be Wyndham's focus,  while acknowledging that consolidation may introduce some M&A risk. HIGH EXPOSURE TO TIMESHARE Fitch generally views the timeshare business less favorably than the lodging  business due to greater earnings volatility and capital intensity. Fitch  estimates that roughly half of Wyndham's revenues and slightly less than half of  its EBITDA comes from timeshare operations (including a small amount of  timeshare-related fee revenue).  Excess inventory build leading up to the global financial crisis has kept  development spending low for the industry at this point in the cycle. Fitch  expects higher development spending associated with inventory replenishment to  lead to increased cash flow volatility for timeshare companies during the next  three to five years. Wyndham has modified its timeshare business model in an effort to reduce cash  flow volatility.  Examples include emphasizing recurring management fees  (evidenced by its acquisition of Shell Vacations, which mostly consists of  already sold inventory), as well as the company's transition of a portion of its  business to the WAAM model. Wyndham created the WAAM model to improve the  capital efficiency of its timeshare business. The company has cycled through  several iterations of WAAM based on changing market conditions and opportunity  sets in the industry. In Fitch's view, the WAAM model is more efficient with respect to capital  allocation, but the level of risk taken by Wyndham has increased as the WAAM  model has evolved. WAAM began as an opportunistic extension of Wyndham's  timeshare sales and marketing platform whereby the company earned commission  revenues for selling timeshare inventory owned and developed by unaffiliated  third parties.  The most recent iteration of WAAM has Wyndham selling owned land and work in  progress (e.g. existing inventory) to a third party that will finance and build  the timeshare units under the company's supervision. Wyndham agrees to  repurchase the inventory based on a prescribed takedown schedule.  Each WAAM deal has been somewhat idiosyncratic and future deal terms could  change. Wyndham will also continue to develop timeshare resorts on its balance  sheet. Longer term, Wyndham's goal is for approximately 50% of its run rate  development spending to be WAAM deals. Fitch expects the company will continue to seek timeshare inventory sourcing  opportunities under its asset-light WAAM business model, in addition to modest  timeshare inventory spending of roughly $150 million annually. Longer term, the  ratings incorporate Fitch's assumption that inventory spending will ramp up  modestly, resulting in a continued solid FCF profile. INCREASED OFF-BALANCE-SHEET LIABILITIES The ratings contemplate Wyndham's off-balance-sheet liabilities that include  contractual and contingent obligations, which have increased during the past  several years. Fitch incorporates these items into the ratings by analyzing  Wyndham's liquidity position and the potential impact to increased leverage  under various liability funding scenarios.  Inventory purchase commitments under its WAAM business model have increased  Wyndham's off-balance-sheet contractual obligations. Fitch recognizes the  financing elements associated with these transactions, but does not consider  them akin to debt.  As with all of its financial obligations, Fitch is monitoring closely Wyndham's  total and maximum annual funding requirements related to its timeshare inventory  purchase commitments, emphasizing the impact to leverage under weaker economic  and industry conditions. Wyndham has adequate flexibility to redirect  discretionary capital expenditures (i.e. share repurchases) to pay down debt and  reduce leverage in an economic downturn. The company's contingent obligations have increased in recent years due, in  part, to performance guarantees associated with recent management agreements  with FelCor (FCH) and Hospitality Properties Trust (HPT).  Fitch recognizes that the company may periodically need to enter into management  agreements that contain performance guarantees in order to grow its hotel  system, thereby increasing its contingent obligations. However, Fitch expects  Wyndham to limit its use of performance guarantees going forward - mainly using  them to bolster the competitive position of its upscale hotel brands. LBO RISK Fitch believes the company has attributes commonly associated with leveraged  buyout (LBO) targets, such as a high FCF yield and a diverse set of operating  business with varied cash flow profiles and return characteristics. This risk is  heightened in the current accommodative credit environment. However, several factors mitigate the potential credit risk from an LBO,  including change of control provisions in its bond indentures and the limited  leveragability for some of its businesses. Fitch also notes that most of  Wyndham's publicly traded peers are committed to an investment grade balance  sheet strategy.  LIQUIDITY PROFILE At Dec. 31, 2013, cash of $194 million, $1.3 billion of availability (less CP  and letters of credit) under its corporate revolving credit facility, and $388  million of availability under its two-year vacation ownership conduit facility  underpinned the company's ample liquidity position. Wyndham has a sizable and well-established consumer financing business related  to its timeshare business. Term securitization transactions of timeshare  receivables provide an additional source of liquidity. Recent transaction terms  have been favorable. Market accessibility was better than Fitch's expectations  through the recent recession, although transaction terms were much less  favorable than the current financing environment. Wyndham has no major debt maturities during the next four years. The company had  $210 million in CP outstanding as of Dec. 31, 2013. SENSITIVITY/RATING DRIVERS --Fitch has set Wyndham's core lease-adjusted leverage target at 3.25x with a  cap of 3.5x for an IDR of 'BBB-', Stable Outlook. There is only limited  tolerance in the current rating/Outlook for leverage at or above 3.5x on both an  annual and quarterly basis. Fitch allows for leverage to be slightly above its  target level at 'BBB-' due to Wyndham's strong FCF profile. Wyndham's core  lease-adjusted leverage (excluding securitized timeshare debt and related  financing income) was 3.4x as of Dec. 31, 2013. --Wyndham's off-balance-sheet commitments have increased recently and further  increases could have a negative impact on the ratings and/or Outlook.   --Wyndham's current FCF/debt ratio is 21.3%, which is very strong for the rating  category. If the company's FCF/debt deteriorated to below 15% without the  company reducing leverage to within 3.25x, there would be negative pressure on  the rating/Outlook. --Negative rating pressure could result if Fitch's outlook for development  spending and the capital intensity of the company's businesses were to increase  materially. --Reducing and sustaining leverage at around 2.75x and the adoption of more  conservative financial policies could result in upward momentum for Wyndham's  ratings/Outlook. Fitch does not expect this to occur. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Wyndham Worldwide Corporation --IDR at 'BBB-'; --Short-term IDR at 'F3'; --CP at 'F3'; --$1.5 billion senior unsecured credit facility at 'BBB-'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB-'. Fitch has assigned the following ratings: Wyndham Global Finance PLC --Short-term IDR at 'F3'; --CP at 'F3'.

4,"  (Adds details, forecast, Wyndham results)July 24 Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc  reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit as an increase in global business travel drove occupancy and room rates.The operator of the Sheraton and Westin chain of hotels also raised its full-year profit forecast to $2.78-$2.85 per share from $2.76-$2.83.""As we look ahead to the balance of the year, we expect that global trend lines will fuel demand for high-end travel,"" Chief Executive Frits van Paasschen said in a statement.Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, Starwood reported a 5.3 percent rise in revenue per available room (RevPAR) at its global hotels open at least one year. RevPAR is calculated by multiplying a hotel's average daily room rate by its occupancy rate.Smaller hotel operator Wyndham Worldwide Corp also reported a better-than-expected rise in second-quarter profit on Thursday. Starwood's net income rose to $153 million, or 80 cents per share, for second quarter ended June 30, from $138 million, or 71 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, the company earned 77 cents per share from continuing operations. Stamford, Connecticut-based Starwood, which has nearly half of its properties outside North America, said total revenue fell 1 percent to $1.54 billion.Analysts on average had expected a profit of 75 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Starwood's shares closed at $83.74 on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.

5,"   By Andrew Both | GREENSBORO North Carolina  GREENSBORO North Carolina Camilo Villegas, refreshed after a quick trip back to his native Colombia, carded seven-under-par 63 to earn the lead after the first round at the Wyndham Championship on Thursday.Villegas compiled an eagle and five birdies for a one-stroke edge over Americans Webb Simpson and William McGirt in delightful conditions on a mild summer's day at Sedgefield.""It was nice to go without any bogeys and I think it probably showed it was a consistent round,"" Villegas told reporters.""I kept it on the fairways, on the greens and just made the putts when I hit it close. My birdie putts weren't even that long. I just hit the ball nicely.""Villegas, 32, a three-time PGA Tour winner, was heavily promoted by the PGA Tour as the next big thing when he burst on tour in 2006.But his career stalled as he battled minor injuries and loss of form and he fell to 148th on the rankings in 2012. ""Do I feel like I have played to my potential the last two-and-a-half years? No,"" he said. ""But it's not everything about golf. You've got to be a little bit easy on yourself and just enjoy life. The game has been good to me. I have no complaints.""Did I see (a 63) coming? Not really, but I felt good on the range this morning and just kept it going.""A keen cyclist, he returned home last week to visit his parents in Medellin, where he enjoyed some strenuous rides around the mountainous terrain. As well as Villegas played, he could not steal much local attention away from North Carolina-born Webb Simpson, the 2012 U.S. Open champion who lives in nearby Charlotte.Charlotte is also home to Martin Laird, though the Scot was born much further afield in Glasgow.Laird has won three times on tour, most recently the Texas Open last year, but rather than using those successes as a springboard, he has regressed this season. However, a return to coach Mark McCann six weeks ago has the 31-year-old hopeful he is back on the right track after missing all four majors this year.""I'd been struggling with my ball-striking a little while, kind of searching,"" Laird, who had been in sight of the early lead after shooting a five-under 65, told reporters.""We started working on some things that we worked on in the past and with that little comfort factor knowing I played my best golf working with him in the past, we clicked and I started playing a little better and building the confidence week by week.""

6,"   By Andrew Both | GREENSBORO North Carolina  GREENSBORO North Carolina Nick Watney carded a five-under-par 65 to grab the lead after the third round at the Wyndham Championship on Saturday.The American sank a 20-foot putt from the fringe at the last to edge one stroke clear of Canadian Brad Fritsch (65) atop a tightly-bunched leaderboard at Sedgefield.Swede Freddie Jacobson (66) and halfway leader Heath Slocum (68) were two strokes off the pace while 2012 U.S. Open champion Webb Simpson was among a group of nine others within four shots.Watney, 33, is a five-times winner on the PGA Tour but has struggled this season and is a lowly 110th on the tour's points standings.He became a father in March and it took him a while to learn the art of time management. When he missed the cut by one stroke at the British Open in July, he knew it was time to take stock.""I was really down,"" Watney told reporters, before addressing the subject of parenthood. ""It's definitely been a learning process for me (and) time management is the biggest thing, wanting to be there for her and my wife and still try to become a good player. ""Some nights she's not going to sleep very much and I need to help out a little more (rather) than just after a round go home and watch TV and lay around.""Watney has made only one bogey all week, while Fritsch has not dropped a shot since a pair of bogeys on Thursday.The 36-year-old Canadian jump-started his third round with an eagle from 76 yards at the par-four eighth hole to move into contention for his first tour title. Even though he is ranked 163rd on tour and needs a strong finish on Sunday to keep his exempt status, Fritsch sounded more concerned with his father's performance in the club championship at Carleton Golf Club in Ottawa.""I kept my mind on it because he's never won,"" Fritsch said of his father Brian, who was playing the final on Saturday.There were two holes-in-one on Saturday, by David Toms at the seventh and Kevin Foley at the 12th. ""I crushed it right at (the flag),"" said Toms, who hit a five-iron from 200 yards. ""I knew I had to hit it solid. I landed it in the front fringe and it rolled in like a putt.""It was Toms's third ace on tour. His first came at the 2001 PGA Championship, which he won for his lone major title. His second was at the Jack Nicklaus-hosted Memorial tournament, while he was playing with the 18-times major champion.Foley's ace came at the 12th, with a five-iron from 195 yards. His ball ran to the back of the green, stopped momentarily and then backtracked towards the hole at the front of the green.""It was taking the break pretty good right towards the hole,"" he said.

7,"   By Andrew Both | GREENSBORO North Carolina  GREENSBORO North Carolina Colombian Camilo Villegas snapped a four-year PGA Tour title drought with a one-stroke win at the Wyndham Championship on Sunday, avoiding an almost certain playoff as those behind him stumbled.Villegas carded a flawless seven-under-par 63 to take the lead into the clubhouse and then watched the rest of the field falter, making him the first South American to win the event.The 32-year-old Colombian made his move early, storming around the front nine in 29 strokes, which included a five-foot eagle at the par-five fifth at Sedgefield.""I'm pretty hard on myself. I've always worked hard and believed in myself, sometimes more than others, and I'm happy to be here,"" Villegas told reporters after holding his nerve with a steady back nine to clinch his fourth PGA Tour victory.Villegas finished at 17-under 263 to edge Swede Freddie Jacobson (66), who bogeyed the last after missing a 10-foot putt, and American Bill Haas (64). ""It really sucks when you play solid all day,"" Jacobson said. ""I really thought it was my day coming in.""He was not the only one to squander a chance of winning the event previously known as the Greater Greensboro Open.Third round leader Nick Watney led with seven holes to play but closed poorly, running up a double-bogey at the last after slicing his tee shot out of bounds. ""That was a really bad shot at a really bad time,"" five-times PGA Tour winner Watney lamented after carding 70 to tie for fifth on 14-under.Fellow American Heath Slocum also shared the lead with two holes left, but finished bogey-bogey to fall back to fourth at 15-under.It may not have been the most exciting way for Villegas to secure victory, sitting in air conditioned comfort watching his rivals falter, but he was not fussy after enduring a four-year title drought and falling to 254th in the world rankings. ""I was hoping for a playoff. Even though I played great today I thought I needed one more (birdie),"" he said as he sat beside the Sam Snead Cup, named for the eight-times Greensboro winner.Villegas said his apparent slump over the past couple of years was not as bad as it seemed looking at results.""There's such a small margin between playing good, playing average, playing bad,"" he said. ""We choose a pretty interesting game to make it our job and you've got to be patient. I've been learning that maybe taking it a little bit easier on myself is a good equation.""

16,"  (Adds new sourcing, background)By Mike StoneOct 27 China's sovereign wealth fund and two big Chinese companies have expressed interest in Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc, joining other potential suitors from around the world, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.Starwood Hotels, the owner of St. Regis and Sheraton hotel brands, has indicated it is considering a sale, and its highly prized collection of properties has also garnered interest from wealthy Middle Eastern investors and other global firms, the person said.Lodging giant Shanghai Jin Jiang International Hotels Group Co, Hainan Airlines Co's parent HNA Group as well as sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp have expressed interest in Starwood, according to the source, who was  not authorized to speak on the record. The three Chinese entities have submitted proposals to the Chinese government over the past two months to allow them to compete to buy Starwood, the WSJ reported, citing sources. (on.wsj.com/1H7RnXF)Beijing is expected to select a single bidder in the next few weeks, the Journal said. China's government only wants one bidder so as not to drive up the price by bidding against one another, the paper said.Starwood shares rose as much as 12.5 percent to $77.10 on Tuesday, giving the company a market value of about $13 billion. Starwood said it did not comment on market rumors or speculation.Shanghai Jin Jiang International Hotels Group, HNA Group and China Investment Corp did not respond to requests for comment. If a Chinese company does emerge as the ultimate buyer for Starwood, it could be controversial. In the past, Chinese companies have bought other hotel properties, most notably the Anbang Insurance Group's purchase of New York's Waldorf Astoria in 2014 without objection from the U.S. government.The government is unlikely to step in and stop this proposed transaction, although it may shift sensitive meetings out of Starwood properties or ask for particular hotels to be sold if they are near sensitive military institutions, said Paul Marquardt, a Cleary Gottlieb lawyer who is an expert on foreign investment in the United States.Starwood had reached out to potential bidders including InterContinental Hotels Group Plc, Wyndham Worldwide Corp and sovereign wealth funds in July, three months after it decided to explore a sale.InterContinental had said then that it was ""not in talks with Starwood with a view to a combination of the businesses,"" while Wyndham had declined to comment.

20,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Dec 9 The Federal Trade Commission has settled a lawsuit accusing hotel group Wyndham Worldwide Corp of failing to properly safeguard customer information, in a case arising from three data breaches affecting more than 619,000 customers. The consent order on Wednesday was filed with the federal court in Newark, New Jersey, 3-1/2 months after a federal appeals court in Philadelphia said the FTC had authority to regulate corporate cyber security. The case was considered a test of FTC power to fill the void from Congress's failure to adopt wide-ranging legislation on data security.

23,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, March 30 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB-' rating to Wyndham  Worldwide Corporation's (WYN) $325 million senior unsecured term loan. The term  loan ranks pari passu with existing unsecured debt and matures March 24, 2021. A  full list of ratings is provided at the end of this release. Fitch expects the transaction to be leverage-neutral as proceeds of the term  loan, in part, were used to redeem $315 million of outstanding 6% senior notes  due 2016. The term loan carries a floating interest rate and features no  amortization for the first three years. Beginning in March 2019, the loan  amortizes with quarterly principal payments of $4.1 million until March 2020 and  then $8.1 million quarterly through maturity.  The Rating Outlook remains Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings reflect Wyndham's strong free cash flow (FCF) profile, the majority  of which is made up of recurring fee income generated by its lodging, vacation  exchange and rental and timeshare segments.  The ratings also consider management's public commitment to maintain low  investment-grade credit metrics. However, the company has indicated a  willingness to let its credit ratings fall to a high speculative grade for a  strategic acquisition, provided management sees a path to returning to  investment grade over a reasonable time period. The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that WYN will continue to  operate within our target adjusted leverage of 3.25x, with a firm cap at 3.5x at  the 'BBB-' rating level. Fitch's ratings have limited tolerance for leverage  sustaining above 3.5x on an annual and quarterly basis.  Fitch would expect the company to swiftly reduce leverage back closer to our  3.25x target for the rating if, for example recent improvements in WYN's loan  loss provision and timeshare inventory procurement costs prove unsustainable  through the cycle. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --U.S. lodging industry RevPAR growth increases by 4%-5% during 2016 and remains  positive, in the mid- to low-single-digit range, for the balance of the forecast  period. --Flat to slightly negative results in WYN's vacation exchange and rentals  business as low single-digit member gains at RCI are offset by a secular decline  in average spend per member. --Modest improvement in the company's timeshare sales revenue driven by improved  volume per guest (VPG). --Continued emphasis on sourcing less capital intensive timeshare inventory  through discounted repurchases and its WAAM third-party development funding  model. --WYN returns its excess FCF to shareholders through dividend increases and  share repurchases, regulating the latter to maintain at or near Fitch's 3.25x  leverage target at the 'BBB-' rating. --Fitch's ratings do not contemplate WYN undertaking a 'transformative'  acquisition. RATING SENSITIVITIES --Fitch has set Wyndham's core lease-adjusted leverage target at 3.25x with a  cap of 3.5x for an Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'BBB-'/Outlook Stable. There  is only limited tolerance in the current rating/Outlook for leverage at or above  3.5x on both an annual and quarterly basis. Fitch allows for leverage to be  slightly above its target level at 'BBB-' due to Wyndham's strong FCF profile.  Wyndham's core lease-adjusted leverage (excluding securitized timeshare debt and  related financing income) was 3.2x as of Dec. 31, 2015. --Wyndham's off-balance-sheet commitments have increased recently and further  increases could have a negative impact on the ratings and/or Outlook. --Wyndham's current FCF/debt ratio is 18.4%, which is very strong for the rating  category. If the company's FCF/debt deteriorated to below 15% without the  company reducing leverage to within 3.25x, there would be negative pressure on  the rating/Outlook. --Negative rating pressure could result if Fitch's outlook for development  spending and the capital intensity of the company's businesses were to increase  materially. --Reducing and sustaining leverage at around 2.75x and the adoption of more  conservative financial policies could result in upward momentum for Wyndham's  ratings/Outlook. Fitch does not expect this to occur. FULL LIST OF RATINGS Fitch currently rates Wyndham as follows: Wyndham Worldwide Corp. --Long-term IDR at 'BBB-'; --Short-term IDR at 'F3'; --Senior unsecured revolving facility at 'BBB-'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB-'; --Commercial paper at 'F3'.

28,"  Kim Si-woo completed a brilliant weekend for South Korean golf when he blew away the field for a five-stroke victory at the Wyndham Championship in North Carolina on Sunday.Eleven years after his compatriot K.J. Choi won in Greensboro, Kim added his name to the Sam Snead Cup, matching the lowest numerical score posted in the event that dates back to 1938.Barely 24 hours after Park In-bee captured the Olympic women's golf gold, Kim carded 67 to finish at 21-under-par 259, capping off his performance with a 13-foot birdie at the final hole at Sedgefield Country Club.An hour-plus rain delay with two holes left merely postponed the celebrations.Englishman Luke Donald (67) put his mediocre recent play behind him to take second place on 16-under, but the day belonged to Kim.The 21-year-old South Korean, in his 38th start on the PGA Tour, is the youngest winner since Jordan Spieth won the 2013 John Deere Classic at the age of 19 years, 11 months. And Kim is the fifth South Korean champion on tour, joining Choi (eight wins), Yang Yong-eun (two), Bae Sang-moon (two) and Noh Seung-yul (one).Kim used his textbook-perfect swing to card a course record second-round 60 and never looked back, knocking approach shots close to the hole to distance himself from the field with precise shotmaking rather than a hot putter.He was so far ahead with nine holes left that the result was hardly in doubt, even after he made three bogeys in five holes from the 10th. ""I aggressively played. I already made top 125 (in tour rankings), feel confidence so I don't have any fear to attacking the pin,"" he told reporters about having already retained his tour card and qualified for the FedExCup.""I never expect any course record. I'm very happy being the youngest winner this year.""Despite his tender age, Kim is not the youngest ever champion in Greensboro. That honor belongs to the late Seve Ballesteros, who was 20 when he won in 1978. Ballesteros went on to win the British Open three months later, the first of five major championships for the Spaniard.Kim's immediate ambitions are not quite so grandiose.""My goal is winning one more time next two years,"" he said, perhaps being overly modest.
