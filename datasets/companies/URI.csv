0,"  United Rentals Inc (URI.N), the world's largest equipment rental company, said on Sunday it had agreed to acquire privately held National Pump, the second-largest specialty pump rental company in North America, for $780 million.The deal marks United Rentals' foray into the pump rental sector, which is benefiting from increased demand from energy and petrochemical companies tapping into the shale gas boom in the United States. Upstream oil and gas customers account for about half of National Pump's revenue.National Pump, which was founded in 2007, will become part of United Rentals' specialty division. United Rentals, which also rents out forklifts, water pumps, diesel generators and earthmoving and trench safety equipment, said the deal offered significant cross-selling opportunities.""This transaction is an important step in our strategy to create a company that delivers strong financial returns through the cycle,"" United Rentals Chief Executive Officer Michael Kneeland said in a statement.In a revision to its financial outlook, United Rentals said it was expecting 2014 revenue in the range of $5.45 billion to $5.65 billion and adjusted 2014 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of between $2.55 billion and $2.65 billion. The company's previous guidance for revenue was in the range of $5.25 billion to $5.45 billion and for adjusted EBITDA, between $2.45 billion and $2.55 billion for 2014.Stamford, Connecticut-based United Rentals added on Sunday that its intention was to complete its $500 million share-buyback program by April 2015. Under the terms of the deal, United Rentals will pay $765 million in cash and $15 million in stock for National Pump, which consists of four separate companies.An additional cash payout of $75 million is foreseen, should National Pump achieve adjusted EBITDA of $134 million in the 12 months after the deal closes. If adjusted 12-month EBITDA hits $161 million in the 18 months after the deal closes, United Rentals will make an additional $50 million payment. National Pump generated $103 million in adjusted EBITDA in the last 12 months. Its acquisition by United Rentals, which has a market value of $8.25 billion, is expected to be completed early in the second quarter of 2014.United Rentals also said it expected to receive a cash tax benefit with a net present value of about $110 million as a result of the acquisition.Centerview Partners and Morgan Stanley & Co LLC (MS.N) acted as financial advisers to United Rentals, while Sullivan & Cromwell LLP acted as legal adviser.

2,"   By Tim McLaughlin | BOSTON  BOSTON May 6 If you're looking for top performing U.S. junk bond funds, pick one that's maxed out in stocks.Bond-fund managers at Loomis Sayles, Fidelity and Eaton Vance are trouncing their benchmarks and almost all their peers by taking advantage of asset allocation rules that permit as much as 35 percent of their holdings in stocks.""Prices are sky high in all sectors of the fixed income market,"" said Matthew Eagan, a portfolio manager at the $18 billion Loomis Sayles Strategic Income Fund. That's why Eagan and some of his competitors are boosting returns by buying stocks and building on existing positions that deliver a one-two punch of dividend yield and capital appreciation.Eagan's bond fund has a 1-year return of 7.92 percent, easily beating the 0.21 advance of its benchmark index and better than 98 percent of its peers in the multisector bond category, according to Morningstar Inc. Its No. 2 overall holding, shares of Corning Inc, have surged 18 percent this year and 41 percent in the past 12 months.Doing even better is the Eaton Vance Bond Fund, whose 1-year return is 9.81 percentage points higher than its benchmark. It is the best performing multisector bond fund with a 1-year return of 10.02 percent, according to Lipper Inc, a Thomson Reuters company.  The $664 million fund's portfolio is about 16 percent to 18 percent invested in stocks, portfolio manager Kathleen Gaffney said.During last month's sell-off of momentum stocks such as biotechnology companies, the Eaton Vance fund took advantage of the stock market dip by adding to existing stock positions, Gaffney said. The fund's largest stock holdings include Ingersoll-Rand PLC, Regions Financial Corp <RF. N>, SLM Corp and Kinder Morgan Inc.Fidelity Investments junk bond fund manager Mark Notkin said the earnings yield of stocks in the S&P 500 Index is now about 6.25 percent. That's better than the 5.2 percent yield of junk bonds, which typically have the highest yields in the bond market.Earnings yield is the inverse of a stock's price-to-earnings ratio and shows the percentage of each dollar invested in the stock that was earned by the company. It's calculated by dividing the earnings per share for the most recent 12-month period with the current market price per share. The earnings yield on S&P 500 stocks has been beating junk bond yields ever since the beginning of the economic recovery, with some of the most pronounced gains coming this month, according to Reuters data. ""Historically, if you look back 25 years, high-yield would be several hundred basis points more than the earnings yield of the S&P 500,"" Notkin said. ""Now, the S&P is a 100 basis points more than the high-yield market. That isn't a little off-kilter, but substantially off-kilter.""Notkin said that's a reason to buy stocks, which he said could outperform junk bond yields for the next two to three years.The Lipper Core Bond Funds index is up 0.11 percent for the 1-year period, as of May 2. And that same index is up 3.2 percent year to date, as of May 2.To be sure, bond fund managers still have to be able to pick the right stocks. The Pioneer High Yield Fund, whose portfolio managers declined to comment, hit some turbulence in the first quarter with its stock selection. The portfolio's allocation to equities was the largest detractor from relative returns. The fund's Class A shares returned 2.6 percent in the quarter, compared to the 3 percent return on the Bank of America Merrill Lynch High Yield Master II Index.One of the fund's stock picks, General Cable Corp, is down 19 percent this year after the company said its income from Venezuela would fall because of changes in the currency exchange rate, pricing controls and social unrest in that country.MANDATE FLEXIBILITY Some multisector and junk bond funds have the flexibility in their mandates to buy stocks and preferred stocks in addition to their holdings of bonds of all stripes. Eagan's fund at Loomis Sayles, for example, can hold as much as 35 percent of its assets in preferred stocks and dividend-paying common stocks.The $10.3 billion Fidelity Capital & Income Fund  run by Notkin, has been maxed out for several quarters with almost 20 percent of its portfolio in stocks, according to its latest fund disclosure. Notkin's bet on Station Casinos was a top contributor to the Fidelity fund's first-quarter performance after the casino operator got a lift from better-than-expected results from its Las Vegas operations.United Rentals Inc, a top stock holding in Notkin's fund, has climbed 18 percent in the past three months as a recovery in the commercial construction industry boosts demand and rental rates for the company's equipment.Notkin's fund has been on a winning streak for a long time, posting a 5-year average annual return of 16.93 percent, compared to the benchmark average annual return of 4.89 percent, according to Morningstar.That puts Notkin's fund in the top 97 percent in high-yield bond category. The fund's 1-year return of 7.59 percent has been helped by avoiding pricey high-yield debt that's trading above par.Bond fund managers who venture into the stock market tend to be value investors, hunting for large-cap, dividend-rich stocks that come with solid balance sheets and strong cash flow.""I stay away from the high flyers,"" Eaton Vance's Gaffney said. She added that stocks shelter part of her portfolio from the interest-rate risk that can hurt a bond fund's performance.If a stock has a dividend yield of around 4 percent, it's fine with some bond fund managers if its share price does little in the way of appreciation.""Four percent is shaping up to be a good number for all bond managers in 2014,"" said Eagan at Loomis Sayles.(Reporting By Tim McLaughlin)",2014-05-06,URI,"Tue May 6, 2014 | 11:53am EDT",Junk bond fund yields trounce peers as managers buy stocks to boost returns,http://www.reuters.com//article/funds-bonds-stocks-idUSL2N0NR18W20140506?type=companyNews

4,"  NEW YORK Shares in United Rentals Inc (URI.N) shares could jump 50 percent over the next two years because the current stock price doesn't reflect the company's true value, Barron's reported on Sunday, citing an analyst from Wells Fargo.The company's stock has been recently punished by worries about low oil prices. The concern was that U.S. shale production would slow dramatically, hurting the rental equipment market.But Wells Fargo analyst Justin Ward said only 6 percent of United Rentals' revenue comes from the oil market, which suggested that the current price of $96.46 is a bargain.Ward thinks shares of United Rentals, which is expected to report first-quarter results this week, could bounce back to $115. In fact, Ward said United Rentals could be worth $150 per share or more in two years.  He cited several earnings metrics that suggest the company is undervalued.  United Rentals is trading at six times enterprise value to projected 2015 EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, of $2.95 billion, according to Ward. The company expects EBITDA to reach $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion in 2017, 42 percent higher above last year's level. Assuming 2017 estimated EBITDA of $3.75 billion, and no change in net debt, the stock would be priced at $150, or 50 percent above Friday's level, the Wells Fargo analyst said.

14,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss | BOSTON  BOSTON Activist hedge fund Marcato Capital Management announced its second big investment in a week on Thursday, saying it snapped up a 5.1 percent stake in crane and heavy equipment manufacturer Terex Corp (TEX.N).Terex's stock price climbed 2.16 percent after the San Francisco-based hedge fund said in a regulatory filing that it now owns 5.5 million Terex shares. It called the stock undervalued and said it plans to talk to management about ways in which to perform better.Earlier this year, the $2.6 billion Westport, Connecticut-based company said it would sell its material handling and port solutions business to Finnish company Konecranes (KCR1V.HE), suggesting that it is already willing to dispose of businesses that are not earning attractive returns.Since January, its share price has climbed 28 percent and analysts expect the company may say more about other possible sales when it reports earnings early next week. By selling off some businesses, Terex could line its coffers to buy back shares, something many activist investors have pushed for in recent years.Marcato already owns a stake in equipment rental company United Rentals Inc (URI.N), one of  Terex's largest customers, and its foray deeper into the industrials sector now comes only a few months it hired Matt Hepler. Hepler specialized in industrials while working for famed activist investor Ralph Whitworth's Relational Investors. Most recently Hepler worked for Red Mountain. On Monday, Marcato Capital Management announced a 5.1 percent stake in the Buffalo Wild Wings Inc (BWLD.O) restaurant chain, helping to send the stock price up some 17 percent this week.Marcato's founder, Mick McGuire, who had previously worked as a partner at William Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management, traditionally urges companies where he invests to allocate capital more wisely. Buffalo Wild Wings has its analyst day scheduled for Aug.  16 when some analysts expect the chief executive to announce more aggressive buybacks and possibly a shift to having more of its restaurants run by franchisees.For Marcato, which oversees roughly $1.5 billion in assets, the two investments in companies that have not been very popular with hedge funds could go a long way to helping wipe away this year's losses. Through the middle of July, Marcato was off roughly 10 percent for the year but it has returned an average 9 percent a year over its six-year lifetime.
