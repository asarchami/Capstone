5,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 25 (Fitch) The Federal Reserve's move to allow the use of  Basel III advanced approaches in the calculation of large banks' risk-based  capital will give some institutions more flexibility in meeting capital targets.  But Fitch Ratings sees accompanying increases in operational risk-weighted  assets (RWA) as an additional tool for U.S. bank regulators to use in  supervising capital levels in the industry. The Fed, together with the OCC, announced on Feb. 21 that certain large banks  would be allowed to begin using the advanced approaches methodology (i.e. using  internal models to estimate RWA) in computing regulatory capital levels,  effective second-quarter 2014. This is an important development, as U.S. banks  under the Basel III's advanced approaches have invested heavily to develop the  necessary data and methodologies to calculate risk-weighted assets. On Feb. 21, Citigroup noted in a press release that, as part of the agreement  with the Fed concerning use of the new risk-based capital approach, the bank  would be required to increase the level of RWA associated with operational risk  to $288 billion, compared with $232 billion at year-end 2013. As a result, its  pro forma Tier 1 common (T1C) capital ratio under Basel III fell by  approximately 40 bps to 10.1%, though still above its newly revised Basel III  T1C target of 9.5%.  This followed earlier additions to operational RWA in fourth-quarter 2013  announced by both JP Morgan and Citigroup. JP Morgan noted in its Investor Day  presentation today that its operational risk capital was $30 billion at year-end  2013, which equates to $375 billion of RWA. Recent additions to operational risk  capital had a negative 50 bps impact on T1C in fourth-quarter 2013. A shift to the use of advanced approaches in regulatory capital calculations is  positive for Citigroup and the other approved institutions such as JP Morgan,  Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of New York Mellon, State Street Financial,  US Bank, and Northern Trust. Fitch views the approval for these banks favorably  as it suggests the regulators believe the data and internal risk-weighting  methodologies are sufficient for these banks. However, we see the required changes in operational RWA as a reflection of  regulators' desire to respond to changing industry conditions by altering  operational risk assumptions when needed. Operational risk is a developing risk  within the regulatory framework, and likely will receive more attention over the  near-term due to recent events and losses. This contributes to the continuing  theme of regulatory uncertainty for the industry. The Fed also pushed back the date these institutions would be required to  incorporate the advanced approach methodologies into the annual capital planning  and stress testing, now beginning Oct. 1, 2015, providing them additional time  to integrate the advanced approach frameworks into capital planning and stress  testing.

7,"   By Nick Brown  A U.S. judge on Thursday gave Momentive Performance Materials the go-ahead to send its restructuring plan to creditors for a vote, but criticized a rights offering at the center of the plan over bloated fees for its backstoppers.Judge Robert Drain, at a hearing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in White Plains, N.Y., told the quartz and silicone maker to reduce the $30 million fee to a bondholder group that includes Apollo Global Management for its agreement to guarantee the $600 million rights offering. Momentive went bankrupt in April with a plan to cut about $3 billion of its $4 billion debt load. The plan would pay off senior bondholders and transfer control of the company to second-lien bondholders, including Apollo, through their sponsorship of the equity rights offering. Other creditors cried foul at Thursday's hearing, calling the offering a ploy by Apollo to keep control of Momentive, since Apollo holds both current equity and a big chunk of the bonds that would acquire Momentive's post-bankruptcy equity. Apollo needs no extra incentive to take the deal, so the fee is unnecessary, the creditors argued.  Drain agreed the $30 million figure seemed too high, especially because only a small percentage of the offering figures to be unsubscribed and require backstopping. Momentive hopes to secure creditor support for its plan and go back to Drain for final approval in August or September, but it faces widespread opposition. The vehemence over the fee - a drop in the bucket in the scope of Momentive's capital structure - illustrates the contentious nature of a case in which most creditors believe the Apollo group is receiving a sweetheart deal at the expense of recoveries for other stakeholders.    Senior creditors led by Wilmington Trust [WLMTN.UL] and Bank of Oklahoma, despite being slated to receive full payback, object to the plan because they would not receive extra premiums known as make-whole payments they feel they are owed for refinancing their bonds.Meanwhile, lower-priority bondholders led by U.S. Bank [USBUB.UL] would recover nothing despite their insistence that they are contractually equal to the Apollo-led second-lien group.  Lawsuits are pending on both issues, which depending on their outcomes could unravel Momentive's restructuring proposal.Even within the second-lien bond group, discord rears its head. Fortress Investment Group said it was unfairly excluded from the backstop agreement despite being a large holder of the second-lien debt, and that its calls to the company offering a cheaper backstop agreement for a smaller piece of the rights offering were not returned.

12,"  Japan's Mazda Motor Corp (7261.T)(MZDAY.PK) will broaden a recall of cars sold in the United States because an air-bag inflator, supplied by Japan's Takata Corp (7312.T), could rupture and seriously injure occupants.The issue of ruptured inflators - which can hurl metal shrapnel at vehicle occupants - has bedeviled Takata and triggered the recall of millions of vehicles last year. The company supplied the parts to at least nine global automakers.The recalls were expanded this year as issues cropped up in newer models equipped with Takata air bags and inflators. In a filing Friday by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Mazda said it would recall about 18,000 older models, including 18,000 Mazda6 sedans and 50 RX-8 sports cars from 2003-2004.NHTSA said the inflator could rupture, ""with metal fragments striking and potentially seriously injuring"" occupants.     Mazda dealers will replace for free the passenger-side air bag inflator, beginning in August.The U.S. recall is part of a global recall of nearly 160,000 vehicles for similar issues announced by Mazda on June 23.Indeed, over the past five years, about 12 million vehicles equipped with Takata air bags have been recalled around the world for similar issues. Last week, German automaker BMW said it would recall another 1.6 million cars with Takata air bags because of the risk of injury from inflators that could rupture. In two separate actions Friday, NHTSA said it had opened investigations into cars made by Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS) and Chrysler Group FIA.MI. NHTSA said it was investigating nearly 400,000 2006-2006 Hyundai Sonata sedans after receiving complaints that the seat belt buckle assembly had failed. The safety agency said the problem could cause air bags to fail in a crash.It was also investigating about 123,000 2011-2012 Dodge Chargers over complaints about engines stalling and alternator failure.

27,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 07 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed U.S. Bancorp's (USB)  ratings at 'AA-/F1+'.  The Rating Outlook remains Stable.   The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One Finance Corporation (COF),  Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares  Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB), PNC Financial Services  Group (PNC), Regions Financial Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI), US  Bancorp (USB), UnionBanCal Corporation (UBC), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC), and  Zions Bancorporation (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRS, VIABILITY RATINGS (VR) AND SENIOR DEBT The affirmation of USB's ratings is reflective of an institution that for  several years now has set itself apart from peer institutions due to its  continued out-performance through the credit crisis and subsequently, which is  now focused on furthering its advantages relative to peers. USB's strong ratings are the result of a number of competitive advantages and a  conservative and strong core culture, which have led to better earnings and  credit performance than nearly all peer banks over multiple operating cycles. The company's key competitive advantage is its low-cost deposit base, which  allows USB to profitably lower loan prices to win new business.  This is  important because it brings new banking relationships into the bank, to which  the company can then aggressively cross-sell other services.  To the extent this  cross-sell is successful creates a virtuous cycle in that it fosters much  stickier customer relationships, which in turn allow the company to keep deposit  costs low, which can attract even more customers to the bank. In addition to its deposit cost advantage, USB has an operating cost advantage  as well.  It routinely has an efficiency ratio in the low 50's, better than most  peer institutions, which largely helps to support the company's superior  earnings performance.  As an example, if USB's efficiency ratio was closer to  industry averages, its return on assets (ROA) would also be closer to industry  averages. USB complements its core cost advantages with a loan portfolio that is well  balanced between commercial and consumer assets.  Similar to the loan portfolio,  the company's earnings are also nearly evenly balanced between net interest  income (NII) and non-interest income. In this latter category, USB has a leading market share in corporate trust, has  increased its mortgage banking market share as others retrenched in the wake of  the financial crisis, has a leading and scalable payments and merchant  processing business, and is focused on growing its wealth management offerings. Finally, underpinning all of these advantages is a management team that  continuously makes strategic and smart operating decisions and that is  responsible for helping to create and sustain the company's core operating  culture.  Fitch views USB's management team as one of, if not the best, in the  industry. RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRS, VRs AND SENIOR DEBT USB's ratings remain at the very high end of their potential rating range, and  there is very minimal upside to current ratings from this level. Downward pressure on ratings, while not expected, could result from a number of  factors.  While Fitch would expect some deterioration in credit metrics for USB  - as well as the rest of the industry - given today's benign credit environment,  should USB's metrics deteriorate at a rate faster than peer group averages there  could be pressure on ratings. Additionally, should USB's earnings performance begin to match peer levels  rather than consistently exceed them, this could impact ratings over time. While Fitch views USB's interest rate risk positioning as neutral, which Fitch  views positively from a credit perspective, should the company's performance be  negatively affected by a rising rate environment, this could also impact ratings  negatively. Finally, given that management is a key component in Fitch's analysis and views  of the company, should there be any significant management changes, a negative  rating action could follow. That said, Fitch does not view this, or any of the other potential negative  rating factors as likely. KEY RATING DRIVERS - HOLDING COMPANY   USB's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and banks,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also  equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and  subsidiary default probabilities.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - HOLDING COMPANY Should USB's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, trouble  accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to meet  near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the holding  company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies. This is viewed  as unlikely for USB, though, given the strength of the holding company liquidity  profile.  Fitch is now considering introducing a rating differential between the holding  company and bank in the U.S. due to structural changes in the sector and the  evolving regulatory landscape, as described in the special report 'U.S. Bank  HoldCos & OpCos: Evolving Risk Profiles', dated March 27, 2014. Given Fitch's  views that USB may not receive a long-term debt requirement, its ratings may not  be affected as a result of Fitch's evolving review regarding notching. KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  USB has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, USB is not systemically important and, therefore, the probability of  support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support.   RATING SENSITVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  USB's Support Rating and Support Rating Floor are sensitive to Fitch's  assumption as to capacity to procure extraordinary support in case of need.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by USB and by various issuing  vehicles are all notched down from USB or its bank subsidiaries' VRs in  accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective  non-performance and relative loss severity risk profiles.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings of subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by USB and its  subsidiaries are primarily sensitive to any change in USB's VR.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY The IDRs and VRs of USB's bank subsidiaries benefit from the cross-guarantee  mechanism in the U.S. under FIRREA, and therefore the IDRs and VRs of its main  subsidiary banks are equalized across the group.  The IDRs and VRs of USB's other major rated operating subsidiaries are equalized  with USB's IDR reflecting Fitch's view that these entities are core to USB's  business strategy and financial profile. For USB this mainly includes its Elavon  Financial Services entity based in Ireland.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY  As the IDRs and VRs of the subsidiaries are equalised with those of USB to  reflect support from their ultimate parent, they are sensitive to changes in the  parent's propensity to provide support, which Fitch currently does not expect,  or from changes in USB's IDRs.  To the extent that one of USB's subsidiary or affiliated companies is not  considered to be a core business, Fitch could also notch the subsidiary's rating  from USB's IDR. KEY RATING DRIVERS - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS USB's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one notch higher than the company's  IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from  depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default.  USB's uninsured deposits outside of the U.S. do not benefit from rating uplift  because they do not typically benefit from the U.S. depositor preference unless  the deposit is expressly payable at an office of the bank in the United States.  Since Fitch cannot determine which foreign branch deposits may be dually  payable, they do not get the rating uplift. KEY RATING SENSITIVITIES - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The ratings of long- and short-term deposits issued by USB and its subsidiaries  are primarily sensitive to any change in USB's long- and short-term IDRs.   Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: U.S. Bancorp --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'AA-'; Outlook Stable --Viability Rating at 'aa-'; --Senior debt at 'AA-'; --Subordinated Debt at 'A+'; --Preferred Stock to at 'BBB'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1+'; --Short-term debt at 'F1+'; --Support at '5';  --Support Floor at 'NF'.

30,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 22 (Fitch) U.S. Bancorp's (USB) third quarter earnings remained  good as the company's return on average assets (ROA) clocked in at 1.51% and  return on average equity (ROE) was 14.5%, according to Fitch Ratings.  While  Fitch views these results as solid, it would note that both the ROA and ROE are  down from the sequential and year-ago quarters.  Though net income remained  relatively stable, higher average assets and higher levels of equity impacted  the denominator of both metrics.  This was largely due to the completion of the  acquisition of Charter One's deposit franchise in Chicago in late second quarter  2014 (2Q'14), which is now fully reflected in results. USB's net interest income (NII) was essentially flat from both the sequential  and year-ago quarters.  This was due to some asset growth with the  aforementioned Charter One deposit acquisition.  Given that these deposits were  generally placed in the securities portfolio and likely the securities portfolio  mix shifted more towards comparatively lower yielding U.S. Treasury securities  and securities backed by Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) loans  for Liquidity Coverage Rule (LCR) reasons, the company's net interest margin  (NIM) declined. The NIM came it at 3.16% in 3Q'14 down 11 basis points (bps) from the sequential  quarter and 27 bps from the year ago quarter.  Fitch would expect USB's NIM to  continue to compress given the persistently low interest rate environment. USB's non-interest income declined relative to the sequential quarter due to a  gain on the sale of stock in Visa, Inc. (V) in 2Q'14 impacting the sequential  quarter comparisons.  Also contributing to the sequential quarter decline was  lower mortgage banking revenue, lower commercial products revenue, and lower  credit and debit card revenue, partially offset by increases in corporate  payments and higher deposit service charges.  Relative to the year ago quarter,  non-interest income grew 3% due largely to higher trust and investment  management fees and higher merchant processing revenue offset by lower mortgage  banking income. Expenses declined relative to the sequential quarter as 2Q'14 included a  settlement with the Department of Justice (DOJ) due to mortgage related matters.  Also contributing to the expense decline was an 18.8% reduction in marketing and  business development expenses.  Relative to the year-ago quarter, USB's expenses  were only 1.9% higher.  Fitch continues to view USB's expense management  favorably, and notes that the company's efficiency ratio remained strong at  52.4% in 3Q'14. Credit quality for USB--as well as the rest of the industry--continues to  improve, although the improvements are becoming comparatively more modest.   Given this, USB had an effective reserve release this quarter as provision  expense was lower than net charge-offs (NCOs) by $25 million. Fitch continues to expect some reversion in asset quality metrics for USB, as  well as the rest of the industry.  In Fitch's view, this will be likely due to  continued seasoning of loan portfolios as well as borrowers having potentially  more sensitivity to interest rates should they eventually rise. USB's fully phased-in Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio under the  standardized approach (USB's binding constraint) improved to 9% in 3Q'14, up  from 8.9% in the sequential quarter despite the company returning 78% of  earnings to owners via buybacks and dividends during the quarter.

32,"   By Michelle Conlin | NEW YORK  NEW YORK (This corrects paragraph 28 to show financial institutions in Maryland have 27 years, not 36, to collect deficiency judgments)Many thousands of Americans who lost their homes in the housing bust, but have since begun to rebuild their finances, are suddenly facing a new foreclosure nightmare: debt collectors are chasing them down for the money they still owe by freezing their bank accounts, garnishing their wages and seizing their assets.    By now, banks have usually sold the houses. But the proceeds of those sales were often not enough to cover the amount of the loan, plus penalties, legal bills and fees. The two big government-controlled housing finance companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as other mortgage players, are increasingly pressing borrowers to pay whatever they still owe on mortgages they defaulted on years ago.     Using a legal tool known as a ""deficiency judgment,"" lenders can ensure that borrowers are haunted by these zombie-like debts for years, and sometimes decades, to come. Before the housing bubble, banks often refrained from seeking deficiency judgments, which were seen as costly and an invitation for bad publicity. Some of the biggest banks still feel that way.     But the housing crisis saddled lenders with more than $1 trillion of foreclosed loans, leading to unprecedented losses. Now, at least some large lenders want their money back, and they figure it’s the perfect time to pursue borrowers: many of those who went through foreclosure have gotten new jobs, paid off old debts and even, in some cases, bought new homes.     ""Just because they don't have the money to pay the entire mortgage, doesn't mean they don't have enough for a deficiency judgment,"" said Florida foreclosure defense attorney Michael Wayslik.     Advocates for the banks say that the former homeowners ought to pay what they owe. Consumer advocates counter that deficiency judgments blast those who have just recovered from financial collapse back into debt — and that the banks bear culpability because they made the unsustainable loans in the first place.        “SLAPPED TO THE FLOOR”     Borrowers are usually astonished to find out they still owe thousands of dollars on homes they haven't thought about for years. In 2008, bank teller Danell Huthsing broke up with her boyfriend and moved out of the concrete bungalow they shared in Jacksonville, Florida. Her name was on the mortgage even after she moved out, and when her boyfriend defaulted on the loan, her name was on the foreclosure papers, too.     She moved to St. Louis, Missouri, where she managed to amass $20,000 of savings and restore her previously stellar credit score in her job as a service worker at an Amtrak station.      But on July 5, a process server showed up on her doorstep with a lawsuit demanding $91,000 for the portion of her mortgage that was still unpaid after the home was foreclosed and sold. If she loses, the debt collector that filed the suit can freeze her bank account, garnish up to 25 percent of her wages, and seize her paid-off 2005 Honda Accord.     ""For seven years you think you're good to go, that you've put this behind you,"" said Huthsing, who cleared her savings out of the bank and stowed the money in a safe to protect it from getting seized. ""Then wham, you get slapped to the floor again.""    Bankruptcy is one way out for consumers in this rub. But it has serious drawbacks: it can trash a consumer's credit report for up to ten years, making it difficult to get credit cards, car loans or home financing. Oftentimes, borrowers will instead go on a repayment plan or simply settle the suits — without questioning the filings or hiring a lawyer — in exchange for paying a lower amount.Though court officials and attorneys in foreclosure-ravaged regions like Florida, Ohio and Illinois all say the cases are surging, no one keeps official tabs on the number nationally. ""Statistically, this is a real difficult task to get a handle on,"" said Geoff Walsh, an attorney with the National Consumer Law Center.      Officials in individual counties say that the cases, while virtually zero a year or two ago, now number in the hundreds in each county. Thirty-eight states, along with the District of Columbia, allow financial institutions recourse to claw back these funds.     ""I've definitely noticed a huge uptick,"" said Cook County, Illinois homeowner attorney Sandra Emerson. ""They didn’t include language in court motions to pursue these. Now, they do."" ""A CURSE""     Three of the biggest mortgage lenders, Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co., all say that they typically don't pursue deficiency judgments, though they reserve the right to do so. ""We may pursue them on a case-by-case basis looking at a variety of factors, including investor and mortgage insurer requirements, the financial status of the borrower and the type of hardship,"" said Wells Fargo spokesman Tom Goyda. The banks would not comment on why they avoid deficiency judgments.    Perhaps the most aggressive among the debt pursuers is Fannie Mae. Of the 595,128 foreclosures Fannie Mae was involved in – either through owning or guaranteeing the loans - from January 2010 through June 2012, it referred 293,134 to debt collectors for possible pursuit of deficiency judgments, according to a 2013 report by the Inspector General for the agency’s regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency.     It is unclear how many of the loans that get sent to debt collectors actually get deficiency judgments, but the IG urged the FHFA to direct Fannie Mae, along with Freddie Mac, to pursue more of them from the people who could repay them.     It appears as if Fannie Mae is doing just that. In Florida alone in the past year, for example, at least 10,000 lawsuits have been filed — representing hundreds of millions of dollars of payments, according to Jacksonville, Florida-based attorney Chip Parker.     Parker is about to file a class action lawsuit against the Dallas-based debt collection company, Dyck O'Neal, which is working to recoup the money on behalf of Fannie Mae. The class action will allege that Dyck O'Neal violated fair debt collection practices by suing people in the state of Florida who actually lived out of state. Dyck O'Neal declined to comment.     In Lee County, Florida, for example, Dyck O'Neal only filed four foreclosure-related deficiency judgment cases last year. So far this year, it has filed 360 in the county, which has more than 650,000 residents and includes Ft. Myers. The insurer the Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Company has also filed about 1,000 cases this past year in Florida alone.     Andrew Wilson, a spokesman for Fannie Mae, said the finance giant is focusing on ""strategic defaulters:"" those who could have paid their mortgages but did not. Fannie Mae analyzes borrowers' ability to repay based on their open credit lines, assets, income, expenses, credit history, mortgages and properties, according to the 2013 IG report.  ""Fannie Mae and the taxpayers suffered a loss. We're focusing on people who had the ability to make a payment but decided not to do so,” said Wilson.     Freddie Mac spokesman Brad German said the decision to pursue deficiency judgments for any particular loan is made on a ""case-by-case basis.""The FHFA declined to comment.    But homeowner-defense lawyers point out that separating strategic defaulters from those who were in real distress can be tricky. If a distressed borrower suddenly manages to improve their financial position – by, for example, getting a better-paying job - they can be classified as a strategic defaulter.    Dyck O'Neal works with most national lenders and servicing companies to collect on charged-off residential real estate. It purchases foreclosure debts outright, often for pennies on the dollar, and also performs collections on a contingency basis on behalf of entities like Fannie Mae. ""The debt collectors tend to be much more aggressive than the lenders had been,"" the National Consumer Law Center's Walsh said.   A big reason for the new surge in deficiency claims, attorneys say, is that states like Florida have recently enacted laws limiting the time financial institutions have to sue for the debt after a foreclosure. In Florida, for example, financial institutions now only have a year after a foreclosure sale to sue — down from five.    Once financial institutions secure a judgment, they can sometimes have years to collect on the claim. In Maryland, for example, they have as long as 27 years to chase people down for the debt. Financial institutions can charge post-judgment interest of an estimated 4.75 percent a year on the remaining balance until the statute of limitation runs out, which can drive people deeper into debt.      ""This is monumentally unfair and damaging to the economy,"" said Ira Rheingold, the executive director of the National Association of Consumer Advocates. ""It prevents people from moving forward with their lives.""     Software developer Doug Weinberg was just getting back on his feet when he got served in July with a $61,000 deficiency judgment on his old condo in Miami's Biscayne Bay. Weinberg thought the ordeal was over after Bank of America, which rejected Weinberg’s short sale offers, foreclosed in 2009.     ""It's a curse,"" said Weinberg. ""It's still haunting me. It just doesn't go away.""

Wasendorf began serving a 50-year sentence last year after pleading guilty to embezzling more than $215 million from thousands of customers. The CFTC has estimated the bank's alleged misconduct caused nearly $36 million in losses.Teri Charest, a spokeswoman for U.S. Bank, said the bank did nothing wrong and would defend itself vigorously. ""We did not know about the Peregrine Ponzi scheme and in fact we were a victim of the same scheme,"" she said. A spokesman for the CFTC declined to comment.In her order, Reade also ruled that U.S. Bank cannot escape the CFTC's lawsuit based on its argument that the commission failed to detect the fraud. In court filings, the bank had argued that the CFTC had ""unclean hands"" in the case because it found warning signs during a 1999 audit and took no action against Peregrine.""Although the 1999 CFTC audit should have led the CFTC to monitor Wasendorf's activities more closely,"" its failure to detect the fraud should not prevent it from pursing an enforcement action, Reade said. The order came on motions by both sides for a judgment in their favor as a matter of law before the case goes to trial. The case is set for trial early next year.While limiting U.S. Bank's defense, Reade ruled that other issues, such as whether the bank acted in bad faith, are best left to a jury.

47,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 21 (Fitch) U.S. Bancorp's (USB) fourth quarter 2014 (4Q'14)  earnings remained strong, according to Fitch Ratings.  The company's 4Q return  on average assets (ROA) was good at 1.50%, essentially unchanged from the  sequential quarter but down from 1.62% in the year-ago quarter.  Similarly the  company's return on average equity (ROE) was 14.4% in 4Q'14, essentially  unchanged from the sequential quarter, but down from 15.4% in the year-ago  quarter.  Nevertheless, Fitch continues to consider USB's earnings performance  to be near the top of the banking industry and supportive of Fitch's high  ratings on the company. A bright spot in USB's 4Q'14 earnings, in Fitch's view, was good loan growth.   USB's total loans, excluding covered loans which continue to run-off, grew 1.2%  from the sequential quarter but a strong 7.2% from the prior-year's quarter.  This year-over-year increase was largely due to good growth in commercial loans,  construction and development loans, residential mortgages, and credit card  balances.   Fitch believes that USB was able to win new lending commitments because of its  cost advantages, including both low deposit and operating costs, which allow it  to profitably lower prices to win new relationships and maintain renewal  business.  Further, Fitch believes that over time USB can enhance the  profitability of these relationships through aggressive cross-selling of some of  its complementary products for clients.  Fitch notes that the credit quality of USB - as well as the rest of the banking  industry - continues to be at or near a cyclical trough.  As such, the company's  total net charge-offs (NCO) declined to $308 million in 4Q'14, down from $336  million in 3Q'13, and $312 million in 4Q'13.  Given this, the company had an  effective reserve release as provision was $20 million less than NCOs. This declining provision expense, coupled with good non-interest income growth  and relatively flat net-interest income offset some higher non-interest expense  particularly relative to the year-ago quarter.  Growth in non-interest income,  particularly relative to the prior-year's quarter, was driven largely by higher  trust and investment management fees and higher investment product fees, both of  which helped offset lower mortgage banking income. USB's net interest income increased modestly, as higher levels of earning assets  offset some continued margin compression.  As of 4Q'14, USB's net interest  margin (NIM) declined to 3.14%, down 2 basis points (bps) from the sequential  quarter, and 26 bps from the year-ago quarter.  Fitch would expect continued  margin compression until short-term rates eventually rise. A low-cost operating model continues to be a hallmark of USB's franchise.   Despite some growth in overall expenses, particularly in professional services  as well as marketing and business development, the company's efficiency ratio  remained good, in Fitch's opinion, at 54.3% in 4Q'14.  Fitch would expect some  continued expense growth in the next year.  If short-term interest rates  increase in 2015, which would boost revenue, Fitch would expect USB to deliver  positive operating leverage; if rates do not increase it may be slightly more  challenging. USB did have some one-time items in 4Q'14 which largely offset each other.  This  includes a gain on its investment in Nuveen Investments, partially offset by $35  million of expense related to charitable contributions and $53 million of  incremental legal expense. Given USB's strong capital generation, Fitch considers the company's capital  ratios to be adequate for its rating category.  As of 4Q'14, USB's fully  phased-in Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio under the standardized  approach was 9%. Fitch also notes that USB is in compliance with the fully implemented Liquidity  Coverage Ratio (LCR), which was enhanced over the last year with the build of  High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) in the company's securities portfolio. There was also one management change for USB, which coincided with the quarterly  results.  Andy Cercere, formerly Chief Financial Officer (CFO), has assumed the  role of Chief Operating Officer (COO).  The new CFO is Kathy Rogers, who, Fitch  would note, has a long tenure at the company.  Fitch would expect this  transition to be seamless and consistent with longer-term succession planning.

62,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 15 (Fitch) U.S. Bancorp continued to deliver good performance in  the first quarter of 2015 (1Q'15) with a return on average assets (ROAA) of  1.44% and a return on average equity (ROAE) of 14.1%.  Fitch considers these  results to be strong and believes them to be near the top of the banking  industry, though also notes that these were modestly lower performance numbers  than in the sequential or year-ago quarters. Relative to the sequential quarter, this slight performance decline was due to  revenue which was modestly lower than expense reductions as well as a modestly  lower benefit from reserve releases.  Relative to the year-ago quarter, the  slight performance decline was due to expense growth outpacing revenue growth,  and again a modestly lower benefit from reserve releases. However, in Fitch's view, the main bright spot in USB's 1Q'15 earnings was its   loan growth. Relative to the year-ago quarter, total average loans (excluding  covered loans) grew a strong 6.7%.  This was driven by commercial construction  and development lending partially offset by a slight contraction in retail  leasing and residential mortgages.  On a sequential basis, USB's total average  loans (excluding covered loans) grew 1.3%. In addition, USB also made solid new lending commitments during 1Q'15, including  $29 billion of new and renewed commercial and commercial real estate  commitments.  Fitch continues to note that it believes USB's strong loan growth,  particularly compared to other large banking institutions, is due to its cost  competitive advantages, which allow it to profitably lower loan prices to win  new relationships and maintain renewal business.  During the quarter, USB continued to augment its low-cost deposit franchise by  growing deposits by 6.4% (excluding the Charter One franchise acquisition)  relative to the year-ago quarter, and by 1.1% on a linked quarter basis.  This  was accomplished with the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities remaining  constant. Due to pricing competition for loans in the marketplace as well as the impact of  lower interest rates on the growing securities portfolio, USB's net interest  margin (NIM) declined to 3.08%, down from 3.14% in the sequential quarter and  3.35% in the year-ago quarter.  Fitch would expect continued margin compression  for USB, as well as the rest of the industry, until short-term rates eventually  rise. USB's total expenses declined relative to the sequential quarter, but increased  by 4.8% from the year ago quarter due in part to employee compensation and  benefits.  Nevertheless, in Fitch's view the company's efficiency ratio remains  strong at 53.4%. Fitch notes that credit quality for USB continues to improve.  Fitch believes  that credit quality for USB, and the rest of the industry, is at or near a  cyclical trough, and would expect some reversion in credit metrics over a  medium-term time horizon.  That said, it would also expect USB to continue to  have much better credit performance than industry averages. In Fitch's opinion USB's capital and liquidity position remain sound.  USB's  fully implemented Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio under the  standardized approach was 9.2% at 1Q'15 and under the advanced approaches was  11.8% at 1Q'15.  Given the company's strong earnings performance, Fitch  considers these capital ratios appropriate, even considering that the company  returned 70% of 1Q,15 earnings to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. In addition, USB is in early compliance with both the Liquidity Coverage Rule  (LCR) and the Enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR).

79,"   By Colin Packham and Matt Siegel | SYDNEY  SYDNEY Australia is seeking a guaranteed slice of any growth in demand in the U.S. sugar market in talks with Washington on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact, a source with knowledge of the Australian position said.Australia, the world's third-largest exporter of raw sugar, has rejected a U.S. offer to permit 152,000 tonnes of imports per year, or 62,000 tonnes more than typical annual sales, according to data from Australia's commodity forecaster.The U.S. offer was well below Australia's sugar industry demands for 500,000 tonnes a year. Australian trade representatives were not pressing for a base figure as high as 500,000 tonnes, the source said, but were seeking a mechanism to ensure the country's producers could tap future growth in U.S. sugar demand.""Australia has been pushing for a guaranteed slice of future increased growth, which would deliver some significant gains over the years ahead based on U.S. growth projections,"" said the source, who declined to be identified due to policies on speaking to the media.A spokesman for Australian Trade Minister Andrew Robb declined to comment on the contents of the discussions. He said the negotiations were ongoing and that Australia was ""pushing for commercially meaningful levels of new access."" Australian Agricultural Minister Barnaby Joyce on Monday called on Washington to improve its offer.""God bless you, you ­believe in free trade, ­surely that also goes to us being able to export slightly more than 152,000 tonnes to you,"" Joyce said.Negotiations on the 12-nation TPP could allow more sugar imports into the United States and Japan. But that has brought warnings from U.S. growers about economic devastation and some in Japan go so far as to see a threat to national security. U.S. confectioners and beverage companies support Australia's proposal to increase sugar exports, while  cane growers oppose it.Mexico is also keen to safeguard its preferential access to the U.S. sugar market.Negotiations for a Pacific Rim trade agreement ended on August 1 without hammering out a deal to create the most ambitious free trade zone in a generation, with several issues, including agricultural products key sticking points. The negotiating countries are eyeing convening another ministerial meeting in late August. No date has yet been set.Japanese Economic and Fiscal Policy Minister Akira Amari said he is confident a deal can be struck at the next meeting. The TPP, which would cover around 40 percent of global output, involves Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States and Vietnam.

81,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has upgraded U.S. Bancorp's (USB)  long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'AA' from 'AA-'. The Rating Outlook is  Stable. With this upgrade, USB's ratings are at the top of Fitch's global bank  rating universe. The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One Finance Corporation (COF),  Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares  Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holding  Corporation (MUAH), PNC Financial Services Group (PNC), Regions Financial  Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI), US Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo &  Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRs, VRs, AND SENIOR DEBT The upgrade of USB's ratings is reflective of an institution that for several  years now has set itself apart from peer institutions due to a number of  competitive advantages and a strong operating culture. This has led to better  earnings and credit performance than nearly all peer banks over multiple  operating cycles, and Fitch believes USB is taking steps to extend its  advantages compared to peer institutions. Fitch believes USB's key competitive advantages relate to cost and its  differentiated business franchise. First, over time USB has enjoyed a cost of  funding advantage relative to peers primarily driven by its low-cost deposit  base, which has allowed USB to profitably lower loan prices to keep or win new  clients. While it is noteworthy that there has been some compression in the  funding cost advantage in recent years amid very low interest rates, Fitch  believes this advantage will become more evident should interest rates  eventually rise at some point.   Fitch believes the funding cost advantage is important because it helps to bring  new banking relationships into the bank, to which the company can then actively  cross-sell other services. To the extent that this cross-sell is successful, it  creates a virtuous cycle that fosters stickier customer relationships, which in  turn allows the company to keep deposit costs low. This can then be used to  attract even more customers to the bank.  Secondly, USB operates a very efficient bank where operating expense management  is ingrained in the company's corporate culture. It routinely has an efficiency  ratio in the low 50's, better than many Fitch rated financial institutions,  which largely helps to support the company's superior earnings performance. As  an example, if USB's efficiency ratio was closer to industry averages, its  return on assets (ROA) would also be closer to industry averages. USB complements these core competitive advantages with a balanced business  model, which Fitch views favorably from a credit perspective. This includes a  loan portfolio that is well balanced between commercial and consumer assets, as  well as an earnings stream that is nearly evenly balanced between net interest  income (NII) and non-interest income. It is in this latter category, that Fitch believes, USB is beginning to extend  its advantages relative to peer institutions. USB's corporate trust business is  an area of differentiation for the company. The returns on capital in this  business are relatively stable and it also provides a source of advantageous  deposit funding to the company. Merchant processing is another area of  differentiation for USB. This business is highly scalable and not overly capital  intensive with good growth prospects, particularly internationally. In addition, Fitch would also note that USB is able to run the company at lower  capital ratios than some larger competitors as USB is not subject to a G-SIB  buffer, among other capital requirements. Furthermore, USB's ability to accrete  capital via growth in retained earnings more quickly than some peers due to the  earnings power noted above provides a buffer to these comparatively lower ratios  from a creditor's perspective. In Fitch's view, this capital advantage allows USB to potentially be more  competitive than some peers for certain clients' business while at the same time  maintaining appropriate risk and return parameters that are also consistent with  the company's very balanced risk appetite.  Finally, underpinning all of these advantages is a management team that  continuously makes keen strategic and operating decisions which are responsible  for helping to create and sustain the company's corporate culture. Fitch views  USB's management team as one of, if not the best, in the industry.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES USB's subordinated debt is notched one level below its VR of 'aa' for loss  severity. USB's preferred stock is notched five levels below its VR, two times  for loss severity and three times for non-performance. USB's trust and REIT  preferred stock entities, USB Capital IX and USB Realty Corp, are notched four  levels below its VR. These ratings are in accordance with Fitch's criteria and  assessment of the instruments non-performance and loss severity risk profiles  and have thus been upgraded.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The uninsured deposit ratings of U.S. Bank National Association (USBNA) is rated  one notch higher than USB's IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured  deposits benefit from depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives  deposit liabilities superior recovery prospects in the event of default.  USB's uninsured deposits outside of the U.S., through Elavon Financial Services  Limited (Elavon), do not benefit from rating uplift because they do not  typically benefit from the U.S. depositor preference unless the deposit is  expressly payable at an office of the bank in the United States. Since Fitch  cannot determine which foreign branch deposits may be dually payable, they do  not get the rating uplift. HOLDING COMPANY  USB's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and bank,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also  equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and  subsidiary failure and default probabilities.  SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY The VR of USBNA is equalized with USB's VR reflecting Fitch's view that these  are core to USB's business strategy and financial profile. The IDRs and VRs of  USB's other major rated operating subsidiaries are equalized with USB's IDR  reflecting Fitch's view that these entities are core to USB's business strategy  and financial profile. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR USB has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, USB is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of  support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support. Elavon has a support rating of '1', which is an institutional support rating,  and indicates that there is a high probability that USB would provide support to  Elavon, which is domiciled in Ireland.   RATING SENSITIVITIES VR, IDRs, AND SENIOR DEBT With today's upgrade, USB's ratings are at the top of Fitch's Global Bank  Universe, and are solidly situated at their current level. Downward pressure on ratings, while not expected, could result from a number of  factors.  Given that management is a key component in Fitch's analysis and views  of the company, USB's ratings would be sensitive to any significant and  unplanned management changes that would result in a change in business strategy  or risk appetite.  While Fitch would expect some deterioration in credit metrics for USB--as well  as the rest of the industry--given today's benign credit environment, should  USB's credit results deteriorate at a rate faster than peer group averages,  there could be pressure to ratings or the Rating Outlook. Additionally, should USB's earnings performance begin to match peer levels  rather than consistently exceed them, this could impact ratings over time. While Fitch views USB's interest rate risk positioning as neutral, which Fitch  views positively from a credit perspective, should the company's performance be  negatively impacted by a rising rate environment, this could also impact ratings  negatively. Fitch views the cumulative effects of USB's regulatory initiatives and potential  litigation risk as manageable and contemplated within the rating upgrade. If any  of these efforts ultimately resulted in an outsized fine that pressures capital,  it is may create downward rating pressure. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings for USB and its operating companies' subordinated debt and preferred  stock are sensitive to any change to USB's VR.     LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The long-and short-term deposit ratings are sensitive to any change to USB's  long-and short-term IDR.   HOLDING COMPANY  Should USB's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY  As the IDRs and VRs of the subsidiaries are equalized with those of USB to  reflect support from their ultimate parent, they are sensitive to changes in the  parent's propensity to provide support, which Fitch currently does not expect,  or from changes in USB's IDRs.  To the extent that one of USB's subsidiary or affiliated companies is not  considered to be a core business, Fitch could also notch the subsidiary's rating  from USB's IDR. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Since USB's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively,  there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable  future.  Additionally, there is limited likelihood that Elavon's institutional support  rating of '1' will change over the foreseeable future.

82,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 15 (Fitch) U.S. Bancorp's (USB) third quarter 2015 (3Q15)  continued to be strong and support Fitch Ratings' upgrade of the company's  Viability Rating (VR) to 'aa' earlier this month. USB's 3Q15 return on average assets (ROAA) came in at 1.44% and its return on  average equity (ROAE) was a strong 14.1%. Given the impact low interest rates are having on earnings across the banking  industry as well as the continued increase in compliance and regulatory costs,  Fitch considers USB's continued strong earnings performance to be noteworthy.  This quarter included a couple of non-recurring items, which were cumulatively  neutral on the company's results.  USB reclassified its student loan portfolio  to held for investment from held for sale, and this caused a $58 million charge  giving the disruption in the student loan market this quarter.  Additionally,  USB recorded $60 million of costs related to mortgage banking compliance.  This  was offset by $135 million of gains related to the sale of stock in Visa during  the quarter. Net interest income (NII) was up relative to both the sequential and year-ago  quarters thanks to a stable net interest margin of 3.04% relative to the  sequential period, and a larger balance sheet relative to the year-ago quarter. Similarly, non-interest income expanded relative to the sequential and  prior-year's quarter thanks in part to higher trust and investment management  fees as well as higher merchant processing revenue.  This was partially offset  by lower mortgage banking revenue. USB's expenses grew due to higher compensation and benefits expense as well as  the non-recurring items noted above.  The company's efficiency ratio on a tax  equivalent basis inched up to 53.9%, which still compares very favorably to  peers. Given that interest rates continue to remain low, which constrains revenue  growth, Fitch expects USB's management to be even more vigilant on expense  management in the fourth quarter of 2015 and into 2016. Areas of focus include continued management of the company's employee base and  other discretionary expense items such as travel, printing and postage, and  optimizing professional service contracts. Asset quality for USB--as well as the rest of the industry--remains good.  Both  non-performing loans and net charge-offs remain low and near what Fitch believes  to be a cyclical trough.  Fitch would expect some reversion in asset quality  metrics over time, but would still expect USB's credit performance to be better  than peers. USB indicated that is beginning to observe some aggressive lending in certain  areas of Commercial Real Estate (CRE) and that it would be slightly pulling back  on growing loans in this space. Fitch continues to consider USB's capital and liquidity position as appropriate  for the company's risk profile. USB continues to grow deposits more quickly than loans and the company's loan to  deposit ratio was 85% at the end of 3Q15. USB's fully phased-in Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio under the  standardized approach (USB's binding constraint ratio) was flat relative to the  sequential quarter at 9.2%.  Fitch would note that USB also returned  approximately 80% of current quarter earnings to shareholders via both buybacks  and dividends.

87,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 15 (Fitch) U.S. Bancorp's (USB) fourth quarter 2015 (4Q15) and  full year 2015 earnings continued to be strong and support the company's  ratings, which are the highest in Fitch Ratings' global bank rating universe.   USB's 4Q15 return on average assets (ROAA) 1.41%, down modestly from the 1.44%  in 3Q15.  The company's 2015 full year ROAA was 1.44% relative to 1.54% in the  prior year period. Given the impact low interest rates are still having on earnings across the  banking industry as well as the continued increase in compliance and regulatory  costs, Fitch considers USB's earnings performance to be strong.  USB's total revenue expanded 1.2% from the sequential quarter and 2%  year-over-year.  This growth was largely driven by better net interest income  (NII) primarily driven by higher loan balances as well as the build of the  securities portfolio over the course of the year for Liquidity Coverage Ratio  (LCR) purposes. Average total loans, excluding covered loans, grew 2.5% from the linked quarter  and 4.8% year-over-year.  The linked quarter growth was driven by growth in auto  loans, credit card receivables, and continued growth in commercial loans.  The  year-over-year growth was more substantially impacted by higher commercial loan  balances, with smaller contributions from auto loans, card receivables, and  construction and development loans. While the yields in USB's auto portfolio and card portfolio are comparatively  good, loan yields in the commercial portfolio, which is USB's largest portfolio,  continue to be very competitive.  This mix, as well as the build of the  securities portfolio noted above, resulted in the company's net interest margin  (NIM) remaining relatively unchanged compared to the linked quarter, and down 18  basis points year-over-year. Overall non-interest income, which represents approximately 45% of the company's  revenue, was up 0.60% relative to the linked quarter and down 0.80%  year-over-year.  While there are a number of puts and takes, the overall trends  are higher credit and debit card revenue and higher trust and investment  management fees offset by lower mortgage banking revenue. USB's expense management continues to be good, with the company's efficiency  ratio coming in at 53% both for 4Q15 and full-year 2015.  While the revenue  environment is improving, it still remains challenging and Fitch expects USB to  continue to aggressively manage expense over the course of 2016. USB's asset quality metrics continue to be good and are seasonally higher than  the linked quarter but lower than the year-ago period.   Fitch notes that USB does have some criticized energy related credits, though  energy loans only comprise 1.2% of USB's total portfolio, which Fitch thinks  will be largely manageable.  USB has a 5.4% reserve against this exposure, due  to some added provision this last quarter.   Overall provision expense was higher this quarter as some loan growth and the  energy activity noted above served to boost provision expense by 8.2% relative  to the linked quarter, though it was down 7.9% year-over-year as overall credit  quality remains strong. Fitch continues to consider USB's capital and liquidity position as appropriate  for the company's risk profile. USB continues to grow deposits more and the company's loan to deposit ratio was  85.5% at the end of 4Q15. USB's fully phased-in Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio under the  standardized approach (USB's binding constraint ratio) was slightly down  relative to the sequential quarter at 9.1%.  Fitch would note that USB also  returned approximately 72% of current quarter earnings to shareholders via both  buybacks and dividends. Fitch would also note that USB disclosed a consent order with its regulator the  Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) this quarter due to some  required changes in the company's BSA/AML program.  Fitch believes that the  company is working to be in compliance with the requirements laid out in the  order and it won't impact the company's ratings at this time.

92,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 20 (Fitch) U.S. Bancorp's (USB) first quarter 2016 (1Q16)  earnings continued to be strong and near the top of the industry despite some  higher provision expenses related to the company's energy loan portfolio, which  Fitch Ratings notes represents only 1.3% of the company's total loans  outstanding. Overall, USB's annualized return on average assets (ROAA) was a good 1.32% in  1Q16, though down from 1.41% in the sequential quarter and 1.44% relative to the  year-ago quarter.  Similarly, the company's annualized return on average equity  (ROAE) was 13.0% in 1Q16, down from 13.7% in the sequential quarter and 14.1% in  the year-ago quarter. While USB's earnings performance continues to remain strong the sequential and  year-over-year declines were due largely to higher provision expense to the  company's energy related credits.  Provision for credit losses was $330 million  in 1Q16, which was $15 million more than net charge-offs (NCOs).   Additionally, provisioning was 8.2% higher than in the sequential quarter and  25.0% higher than in the year-ago quarter primarily due to a $257 million  increase in energy-related commercial non-performing assets relative to the  sequential quarter.  USB's reserves for energy related credits were 9.1% of  outstanding balances at the end of 1Q16, up from 5.4% at year-end 2015 (YE15). Given the strong reserve and the relatively small percentage of the overall loan  portfolio related to energy, Fitch considers USB's energy exposure to likely be  manageable should energy prices remain volatile, though it could potentially  continue to impact provision expenses, and therefore earnings. In 1Q16, USB's net interest income (NII) increased 0.6% from the sequential  quarter and 4.9% from the year-ago quarter due largely to higher loan balances  and a benefit from incrementally higher interest rates.   Additionally, the company's net interest margin (NIM) remained relatively stable  at 3.06%, unchanged from the sequential quarter and down just two basis points  from the year-ago quarter. USB's non-interest income was down 8.2% from the sequential quarter and  essentially flat from the year ago quarter.  The sequential declines were due  largely to seasonally lower credit and debit care revenues, merchant processing  services revenue, and deposit service charges.  Additionally, mortgage banking  revenue was down relative to the sequential quarter due to an unfavorable change  in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights. Overall, non-interest expenses were down 2.1% relative to the sequential quarter  due to lower professional services and marketing and business development  expenses partially offset by higher compensation and benefits expenses.   Relative to the year-ago quarter non-interest expenses were up 3.2%.   It is surprising that USB did not achieve positive operating leverage relative  to either the sequential or year-ago quarters, as benefits from higher rates  were offset by some continued loan portfolio mix changes.  Nevertheless, the  company's efficiency ratio remains strong and near industry leaders at 54.6% in  1Q16. Credit quality was impacted by the energy related credits noted above, though  USB's ratio of non-performing assets to loans plus other real estate owned  (OREO; excluding covered assets) was still good at 0.64 in 1Q16, up from 0.58 in  the sequential, but down from 0.68 in the year-ago quarter. USB has continued to exhibit good loan growth, with average loans (excluding  covered loans) up 2.3% relative to the sequential quarter and 6.2% relative to  the year-ago quarter. The growth was generally broad based including higher  commercial loan balances, higher construction and development loan balances, and  higher credit card receivables which were aided by the closing of a small  acquisition. In 1Q16, USB's Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio was relatively  unchanged both under the standardized and advanced approaches.  The fully  phased-in Basel III CET1 ratio under the standardized approach was 9.2% and  under the advanced approach was 11.9%. Given USB's outstanding capital generation, it continues to return capital to  owners through both share buybacks and dividends.  In 1Q16, the company returned  80% of earnings to owners.

99,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK/CHICAGO, May 12 (Fitch) The Basel Committee's (BCBS) proposal to apply  higher capital charges for ""unconditionally cancellable lines of credit"" (UCCs)  could impact internationally active US credit card banks CET1 ratios on average  by 375 basis points, absent any remedial measures from affected institutions,  says Fitch Ratings. If implemented by the US authorities, the measures will  encourage US banks to reduce unused lines of credit to avoid lowering their  capital ratios. This follows the publication of written feedback on the December  2015 consultative proposals to revise the Standardized Approach for credit risk.  Capital rules require banks to convert undrawn credit lines to credit exposures  by multiplying the committed but undrawn amount by a credit conversion factor  (CCF). UCCs to both retail and corporate clients are currently subject to a 0%  CCF under the standardized approach to credit risk (SA). US bank holding  companies with total assets in excess of $250bn, with regulatory approval to use  models for calculating their capital requirements, remain subject to a capital  floor based on 100% of their SA capital requirements. At year-end 2015, UCC  totaling about USD3trn were subject to an SA 0% CCF for a select range of the  largest US bank holding companies and credit card banks, based on regulatory  disclosures. The BCBS believes that consumer protection laws and reputational risk  considerations may constrain banks' ability to cancel such commitments. For this  reason, the Committee believes a 0% CCF is inappropriate and proposes a new CCF  of between 50% and75% for wholesale UCCs and 10% and 20% CCFs for retail UCCs,  i.e. credit cards and personal overdraft facilities. The Basel Committee  proposals would impact large internationally active banks operating under the  Advanced approach.  For large internationally active credit card banks, the implications could be  material if adopted and could change the competitive position for affected  firms. Fitch estimates end-2015 CET1 ratios for select credit card banks could  fall by an average of 3.75% if a 20% UCC CCF is applied to retail credit card  exposures and a 75% CCF applied to wholesale credit card exposures. In contrast,  estimated average CET1 ratios for the large universal banks would drop by just  0.78%. As such, if the US regulatory authorities adopt the BCBS UCC proposal in  its current form, Fitch expects credit card issuers will seek to reduce the  amount of UCC by trimming credit lines for active accounts and/or closing  inactive accounts.  In contrast to US institutions, banks in other major jurisdictions are not  currently subject to a 100% capital floor, where the internal ratings-based  model approach is often used to calculate capital charges for credit card  exposures. Based on a Fitch review of 105 medium-to-large EU banks at end-1H15,  only a few individual German, Dutch, Finnish, and UK banks appear to benefit  significantly from the application of the SA 0% CCF for UCCs. The revised SA proposals for UCCs are possibly influenced by parallel studies  undertaken by the Committee on how banks use internal models to estimate credit  risk capital requirements for UCCs. In a study released on April 1, 2016, the  Committee found that some banks do not assign CCFs (zero or otherwise) to UCCs,  while some banks assign a 0% CCF to commitments that are only conditionally  cancellable. The study also found that assigned non-zero CCFs usually do not  differ materially between UCCs and other facilities.

103,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 15 (Fitch) U.S. Bancorp's (USB) second quarter 2016 (2Q16)  earnings continued to be strong and near the top of the banking industry,  according to Fitch Ratings. This level of operating performance continues to  support USB's ratings of 'AA/F1+', which are the highest in Fitch's Global Bank  Ratings Universe.  USB's annualized return on average assets (ROAA) remained strong at 1.43% in  2Q16, up from 1.32% in the sequential quarter, but incrementally down from 1.46%  in the year ago quarter. Similarly, the company's annualized return on average  equity (ROE) was 13.8% in 2Q16 up from 13% from the sequential quarter but down  from 14.3% from the year-ago quarter.  USB's results continue to consistently be above Fitch's estimate of a range of  the company's long-term cost of equity assumption of between 10%-12%. There were a couple of notable items in the quarter including $180 million of  equity investment income due to the company's membership in Visa Europe Limited,  which was sold to Visa, Inc. in mid-June 2016. This gain was offset by $110  million of accruals related to regulatory and legal matters as well as a $40mn  charitable contribution. USB's total net revenue was up 8.2% from the sequential quarter and 8.1% from  the year ago quarter.  Net interest income (NII) was up relative to both the sequential and year-ago  quarter as some improvement in loan yields and loan mix were offset by lower  rates on new securities purchases as well as lower reinvestment rates on  maturing securities. As a result, the company's net interest margin declined  modestly to 3.02% as of 2Q16. The bigger driver of the revenue increase was higher non-interest income, which  increased 18.8% relative to the sequential quarter and 12.3% relative to the  year-ago quarter. This was driven by the Visa gain noted above as well as higher  credit and debit card revenue, higher commercial products revenue, and higher  mortgage banking income incrementally offset by lower investment products  revenue. USB's mortgage banking revenue was seasonally higher by 27.3% relative to the  sequential quarter, with 65% of mortgage volume driven by new home purchases and  35% driven by refinancings. Given the rally in mortgage rates in the latter part  of the quarter, USB expects an additional 30% growth in mortgage banking revenue  over the next quarter. The company's overall provision expense declined incrementally relative to the  sequential quarter after a significant build last quarter related to higher  levels of criticized energy loans.  This quarter's improvement was driven by modestly lower energy exposure as both  energy loans and commitments declined relative to the sequential quarter as many  loans moved through the spring redetermination period and USB lowered is average  oil price deck to $35 per barrel. Additionally, the improvement in overall oil  prices during the quarter likely helped to shelter performance of underlying  borrowers. Fitch continues to believe that potential problems within USB's energy portfolio  will be manageable given the company's reserves to energy loans of 8.8% at 2Q16,  which compare well with peers. Additionally, the bulk of the company's  criticized energy loans are still performing. USB's non-interest expenses increased relative to both the sequential and  year-ago quarters. This was due to higher compensation expense reflecting merit  increases during the quarter as well as higher professional services expenses  due to compliance related matters. USB continues to address its consent order  related to its anti-money laundering program. Nevertheless the company's efficiency ratio remained strong at 54.9% in 2Q16,  inclusive of the notable items mentioned above.  Credit quality remains good and the company's ratio of non-performing assets to  loans plus other real estate owned (OREO) (excluding covered assets) improved  incrementally to 0.62 due to some modest improvement in the energy portfolio  noted above.  USB has continued to exhibit good loan growth, with average loans (excluding  covered loans) up 1.7% relative to the sequential quarter and 8.6% relative to  the year-ago quarter. The growth was generally broad based but highlighted by  higher commercial loan balances as well as higher construction and development  loans. In 2Q16, USB's Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio was relatively  unchanged both under the standardized and advanced approaches. The fully  phased-in Basel III CET1 ratio under the standardized approach was 9.3% (USB's  binding constraint) and under the advanced approach was 12%. USB recently received a non-objection to its capital plan under the  Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) stress tests. As a result USB  announced a $2.6bn share repurchase program and a 9.8% increase in its common  dividend. In 2Q16 USB returned 77% of earnings to owners via dividends and buybacks, and  Fitch believes the company's total payout ratio will remain between 60%-80% over  the balance of the year.

107,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK/CHICAGO, September 23 (Fitch) A flattening yield curve could continue  to pressure US bank margins following the latest Federal Reserve open market  committee (FOMC) meeting where the medium-term projection for the Fed funds  target rate was lowered again, says Fitch Ratings.  The uncertainty over the rate trajectory and terminal rate, coupled with the  unprecedented length of this low rate period, remain key challenges and sources  of uncertainty for the US banking sector. That said, Fitch believes that rate  risks alone are unlikely to pose major risks to bank credit profiles or ratings. The Fed highlighted that economic conditions had strengthened the case for a  rate increase at the FOMC meeting held on 21 September, underscoring Fitch's  view that an additional 25bps hike by the end of this year is likely. However  the broader messaging remained consistent with a very slow and gradual process  of interest rate normalization, while the Fed's weighted average median  projection for the target rate through to 2019 fell by 25-50bps. This follows a  steady and continuous decline in the target rate projections over the past year.  <iframe src=""//e.infogr.am/666e716c-31bb-4f00-883e-ccc03f12ef4a?src=embe d""  title=""Fed Funds Dot Plot"" width=""550"" height=""741"" scrolling=""no""  frameborder=""0"" style=""border:none;"">  The economic uncertainty and declining long-term rate expectations have  contributed to a steadily flattening yield curve since early 2014, which has  continued this year. Without a sustained reversal in this trend, bank net  interest margins (NIM) are unlikely to see a material increase as margin  pressures are likely to remain. Even a rise in short-term rates would have  limited effect on bank earnings without a corresponding increase in medium and  long-term rates. Fitch maintains that a sustained and consistently steep yield  curve will be the key factor for improving NIMs over a meaningful period with  the shape of the curve being more important for bank earnings than the level of  short-term rates.  Continued low rates could contribute to higher mortgage refinancing and improved  non-interest income, but on aggregate, this has not been sufficient to offset  the earnings effects from falling NIMs. Banks will continue to focus on expenses and operational efficiencies to address  margin compression. Longer duration balance sheets will also be a consequence as  expectations for the low rate environment extend further into the future. Fitch  expects growth in the proportion of long-term loans and securities - maturities  greater than 5 years - in recent years to continue.  On aggregate, the longer duration balance sheet could pose a risk to banks in  the event of a sudden and unexpected increase in rates, but for now are unlikely  to pose a substantive risk to bank ratings. However, should individual banks  react to longer-than-expected margin compression with significant changes to  their balance sheet or business strategies, this may sufficiently alter credit  profiles to warrant a rating action.

108,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed U.S. Bancorp's (USB)  ratings at 'AA/F1+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. The affirmation and Stable  Outlook are driven by the company's continued good operating performance, solid  liquidity position, and stable capital ratios. The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One Finance Corporation (COF),  Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares  Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holding  Corporation (MUAH), PNC Financial Services Group (PNC), Regions Financial  Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI), US Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo &  Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation (ZION). Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly. KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRS, VR AND SENIOR DEBT USB's ratings affirmation is reflective of the company's continued better  earnings and credit performance than nearly all peer banks over multiple  operating cycles. Additionally, USB continues to consistently perform better  than peers in the Federal Reserve's annual CCAR stress tests as measured by the  company's capital ratio deterioration under severely adverse scenario of the  test.  Fitch believes USB's key advantages relate to its business model and its low  cost operating model, both of which have contributed to USB's 'AA' ratings. USB has a balanced business model with net interest revenue (NIR) and  non-interest revenue nearly evenly split in their contribution to the company's  overall revenue base. Fitch views this balance favorably as it helps to support  the company's strong earnings performance through the cycle as well as its solid  internal capital generation. USB's merchant processing business is a significant proportion of the company's  non-interest revenue. Fitch views this growing source of revenue as somewhat  stable and very scalable, thereby providing some persistency to both USB's  earnings and internal capital generation. Combined with the company's strong  credit performance, this helps USB to operate at lower capital ratios than its  peers.  While USB's capital ratios are lower than peers, the company continues to  perform consistently better than nearly all peer institutions under the Federal  Reserve's annual CCAR stress tests. Fitch measures the annual deterioration of  each bank's capital ratios under the severely adverse scenario and notes that  USB continues to consistently be one of the strongest performing banks on this  metric.  USB's other key differentiator relative to peers is that management operates a  very efficient bank where operating expense management is ingrained in the  company's corporate culture. The company routinely has an efficiency ratio in  the low 50's, better than many Fitch rated financial institutions, which largely  helps to support the company's superior earnings performance. As an example, if  USB's efficiency ratio was closer to industry averages, its return on assets  (ROA) would also be closer to industry averages.  USB's funding profile is strong and positively differentiated from peers by its  large corporate trust business. This represents nearly 15% of USB's deposit  funding and is treated favorably by the Liquidity Coverage Rule (LCR). Finally, underpinning all of these advantages is a management team that  continuously makes keen strategic and operating decisions which are responsible  for helping to create and sustain the company's corporate culture. Fitch  continues to view USB's management team as one of, if not the, best in the  industry.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  USB has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, USB is not systemically important, and therefore the probability of  support is unlikely. Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) and Viability Ratings (VRs)  do not incorporate any support. Elavon Financial Services Limited (Elavon) has a support rating of '1', which is  an institutional support rating, and indicates that there is a high probability  that USB would provide support to Elavon, which is domiciled in Ireland.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES USB's subordinated debt is notched one level below its VR of 'aa' for loss  severity. USB's preferred stock is notched five levels below its VR, two times  for loss severity and three times for non-performance. USB's trust and REIT  preferred stock entities, USB Capital IX and USB Realty Corp, are notched four  levels below its VR. These ratings are in accordance with Fitch's criteria and  assessment of the instruments non-performance and loss severity risk profiles.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The uninsured deposit ratings of U.S. Bank National Association (USBNA) is rated  one notch higher than USB's IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured  deposits benefit from depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives  deposit liabilities superior recovery prospects in the event of default.  USB's uninsured deposits outside of the U.S., through Elavon, do not benefit  from rating uplift because they do not typically benefit from the U.S. depositor  preference unless the deposit is expressly payable at an office of the bank in  the United States. Since Fitch cannot determine which foreign branch deposits  may be dually payable, they do not get the rating uplift. HOLDING COMPANY  USB's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and bank,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also  equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and  subsidiary failure and default probabilities.  SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY The VR of USBNA is equalized with USB's VR reflecting Fitch's view that these  are core to USB's business strategy and financial profile. The IDRs and VRs of  USB's other major rated operating subsidiaries are equalized with USB's IDR  reflecting Fitch's view that these entities are core to USB's business strategy  and financial profile. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, VRs AND SENIOR DEBT USB's ratings are among the highest of Fitch's global banks, and are solidly  situated at their current level.  Downward pressure on ratings, while not expected, could result from a number of  factors. Given that management is a key component in Fitch's analysis and views  of the company, USB's ratings would be sensitive to any significant and  unplanned management changes that would result in a change in business strategy  or risk appetite.  While Fitch would expect some deterioration in credit metrics for USB (as well  as the rest of the industry) given today's benign credit environment, should  USB's credit results deteriorate at a rate faster than peer group averages this  could negatively impact ratings or the Rating Outlook. USB's Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.3% as of June 30, 2016 is on the  lower end relative to peers, but the company continues to perform very well  under CCAR stress tests and generates a substantial amount of internal capital  via earnings, both of which support ratings. However, given the comparatively  low position of the ratio, should capital ratios meaningfully decline, this  could pressure the ratings or Outlook. Should technological evolution occur that disrupts the amount and persistency of  revenue in USB's merchant processing business this could negatively impact  ratings. At the same time, should Fitch observe that USB not incur sufficient  expenditures to maintain its technological infrastructure and develop new  technological enhancements, this could pressure ratings or the Outlook. Fitch views the cumulative effects of USB's regulatory initiatives and potential  litigation risk as manageable and contemplated within ratings. If any of these  efforts ultimately resulted in an outsized fine that pressures capital or  significant long-term reputational damage, it may create downward rating  pressure. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  Since USB's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively,  there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable  future.  Additionally, there is limited likelihood that Elavon's institutional support  rating of '1' will change over the foreseeable future. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings for USB and its operating companies' subordinated debt and preferred  stock are sensitive to any change to USB's VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The long- and short-term deposit ratings are sensitive to any change to USB's  long-and short-term IDR.  HOLDING COMPANY  Should USB's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies.  SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY  As the IDRs and VRs of the subsidiaries are equalized with those of USB to  reflect support from their ultimate parent, they are sensitive to changes in the  parent's propensity to provide support, which Fitch currently does not expect,  or from changes in USB's IDRs.

110,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 19 (Fitch) U.S. Bancorp's (USB) third quarter 2016 (3Q16)  earnings were good and remain near the top of its large regional peer group and  the industry according to Fitch Ratings.  This level of operating performance  continues to support USB's high ratings. USB's annualized return on average assets (ROA) was a still good 1.36% in 3Q16,  down from 1.43% in the sequential quarter, and down from 1.44% in the year-ago  quarter. Additionally, the company's return on average equity (ROE) remained  above Fitch's estimated range of the company's cost of equity of between  10%-12%, which Fitch views favorably.  The ROE was 13.5% in 3Q16, down from  13.8% in the sequential quarter, and down from 14.0% in the year-ago quarter. USB's total net revenue was down 2% from the sequential quarter, but up 4.7%  from the year ago quarter. There was continued modest growth in net interest  income (NII) in both periods amid continued balance sheet growth, and more mixed  performance in non-interest income. USB's balance sheet has continued to grow over the course of the year.  Total  average loans (including covered loans) were up 1.1% relative to the sequential  quarter and 7.6% relative to the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year growth was  primarily driven by higher commercial, construction and development, as well as  credit card loans. The latter benefited from two portfolio acquisitions. Deposit growth for USB remained stronger than loan growth, with total deposits  increasing 3.6% from the sequential quarter and 10.0% from the year-ago quarter.   As a result the company's loan to deposit ratio ticked down to 79.9% in 3Q16.   The additional funding generated continues to be placed into cash and investment  securities, with cash balances having a more meaningful increase during the  quarter.  NII on a taxable equivalent basis grew 1.6% from the sequential quarter and 4.3%  from the year-ago quarter. This was due to the previously noted balance sheet  growth partially offset by a shrinking net interest margin (NIM) as the company  altered the mix of its investment portfolio over the last year with a larger  proportion of lower yielding treasury securities and a larger allocation to cash  this quarter. USB's NIM was 2.98% in 3Q16, down from 3.02% in the sequential quarter, and  3.06% in the year-ago quarter. Fitch would continue to expect the NIM to  modestly grind down unless the Federal Reserve raises short-term interest rates  again towards the end of the year. As noted, the company's non-interest income was down 4.2% from the sequential  quarter, but up 5.1% from the year-ago quarter.  The sequential decline was due primarily to an unfavorably sequential comparison  as the linked quarter include a $180 million gain related to an equity  investment in Visa Europe as well as lower revenue from commercial products  partially offset by improved mortgage banking income amid the rally in mortgage  rates towards the beginning of the quarter. Relative to the year-ago quarter USB's non-interest income benefit from the  previously noted higher mortgage banking income as refinancing activity surged  during the quarter. Fitch notes that USB continues to manage expenses carefully, with total expenses  in 3Q16 down 2% relative to the sequential quarter, but up 5.6% relative to the  year-ago quarter. There is some noise in this numbers primarily due to  litigation accruals that occurred in the sequential quarter. In 2Q16, USB incurred $110 million of litigation accruals related to regulatory  and legal matters as well as a $40 million charitable contribution.  Excluding  these items from the sequential comparison, USB's 3Q16 non-interest expenses  relative to the sequential quarter would have increased 3.1%. This increase was  due to higher compensation expenses as well as the impact of the FDIC's deposit  insurance surcharge. Relative to the year-ago quarter USB's expenses were up due to higher  compensation costs as well as higher technology costs.  Fitch views technology  as an important differentiator for USB, and as such, would view a higher tech  spend generally favorably. While the company did not achieve positive operating leverage relative to either  the sequential or year-ago quarters, its efficiency ratio remained good at 54.5%  in 3Q16. Credit quality for USB was stable in 3Q16, as both net charge-off ratio (NCOs)  and non-performing asset ratio (NPAs) remained relatively stable over the course  of the last four quarters.  Fitch continues to believe that credit quality for  USB--as well as the rest of the industry--remains at or near a cyclical trough,  and Fitch would expect some reversion in credit metrics over a medium-term time  horizon. In 3Q16, USB's Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio was unchanged  relative to the sequential quarter both under the standardized and advanced  approaches. The fully phased-in Basel III CET1 ratio under the standardized  approach was 9.3% (USB's binding constraint) and under the advanced approach was  12.1%. This was due to 79% of earnings being returned to shareholders via dividends and  share buybacks, as well as the balance sheet growth noted above.
