United Continental Holdings ranked second in complaints in 2011 and 2012, and dropped to third in 2013, the study shows. American Airlines was fourth in 2011, third in 2012, and fourth in 2013.At United, complaints spiked in 2012 to 4.28 per 100,000 passengers, its highest in the five years studied, after technology changes during the merger with Continental caused outages and led to poorer service. United's complaint rate improved to 2.14 in 2013.United spokeswoman Megan McCarthy said customer satisfaction has improved as the airline focused on enhancing service. American, which merged with US Airways in December to form the world's biggest airline, stood out in terms of complaints about flight delays and cancellations, the study shows.Spokesman Matt Miller said American, under new management headed by former US Airways Chief Executive Doug Parker, has improved in on-time performance and mishandled bags.Delta Air Lines, the third-largest carrier behind American and United, improved its score from 1.96 complaints per 100,000 passengers in 2009 to 0.59 complaints in 2013. Delta has renovated airport terminals and expanded entertainment and food choices on planes since acquiring Northwest Airlines in 2008. Delta ""improved management and operating systems to help stay on time,"" said Laura Murray, consumer associate with the U.S. PIRG Education Fund. ""It would be smart for other airlines to take a look at what it did.""Complaints about Spirit, which offers low base fares but charges for many other services, rose steadily each year, from 6.75 per 100,000 passengers in 2009 to 9.44 in 2013, according to the study.Many of the complaints reflect ""customers not fully understanding that we offer unbundled fares that let them control how much they spend,"" Spirit spokeswoman Maggie Espin-Christina said in a statement.Complaints to the U.S. Department of Transportation about Spirit totaled just over 1,020 last year, out of more than 12 million travelers, she noted.(Reporting by Karen Jacobs in Atlanta; Editing by Richard Chang)",2014-04-10,UAL,"Thu Apr 10, 2014 | 3:37pm EDT",Biggest U.S. airlines among worst in customer service -study,http://www.reuters.com//article/airlines-complaints-idUSL2N0N124J20140410?type=companyNews

23,"  * United has better-than-expected results on revenue, costs* American boosts margin view, to take charges   (Adds United results)July 9 American Airlines Group, Southwest Airlines and United Continental Holdings  on Wednesday cited growth in an important revenue measure during the second quarter, signaling that demand for air travel is solid during the summer.Unit revenue, also known as passenger revenue per available seat mile, is expected to grow between 5.5 percent and 6.5 percent in the second quarter at American, while Southwest forecast a rise of more than 8 percent.United said better-than-expected results in the United States and Asia led its unit revenue to rise 3.5 percent in the period, compared with an earlier forecast of 1 percent to 3 percent growth. Unit revenue is a gauge of how full planes are and of pricing power. Demand ""is as strong as ever,"" said Bob McAdoo, an airline analyst with investment bank Imperial Capital, who noted a stronger-than-expected American outlook and said Southwest revenue results were up ""meaningfully.""Some airline analysts raised their profit estimates for the second quarter, which typically includes some vacation travel.American Airlines, formed in the late 2013 merger of AMR Corp and US Airways Group, said it expects pretax margin of 12 percent to 13 percent for the second quarter, up from an earlier view of 10 percent to 12 percent. UBS analyst Darryl Genovesi said in a note to clients that Southwest's revenue momentum could add 3 cents to his firm's profit estimate of 58 cents for the carrier. American also said it could take charges of up to $630 million in the period. It cited a charge of about $330 million tied to the sale of its portfolio of fuel-hedge contracts and an added $250 million to $300 million in charges related to its merger and other items.Recent profit warnings from European carriers such as Air France-KLM and Lufthansa had raised concern about demand trends, pummeling share prices. Last week, Delta Air Lines said unit revenue for June grew less than it had forecast, citing lower business demand for travel to Latin America during the World Cup soccer tournament and capacity increases that hurt ticket prices. Delta said second quarter unit revenue likely rose 6 percent.McAdoo said the European carriers faced issues that did not affect U.S. airlines as much, such as heavier competition from low-cost rivals.Robert Mann, an airline consultant in Port Washington, New York, said the European airlines that are reporting weakness ""are underperforming and as a result, they probably should look inwardly to solve the problem.""Shares of major U.S. airlines rose, with American Airlines ending up 4.3 percent at $41.99, Southwest finishing up 1.9 percent at $27.21 and Delta increasing 1.4 percent to $36.96.

He said the company expects $190 million in hedge losses this quarter and another $680 million in losses for the remaining three quarters of 2015, based on Jan. 15 estimates.United earlier this year said it had already started to shrink its fuel hedge position. The airline on Thursday said it expects the oil windfall to buoy its profits, forecasting an average jet fuel cost this quarter of $1.96 to $2.01 per gallon.The oil glut, which has driven down prices by more than 57 percent since June, is a boon worth hundreds of millions of dollars to airlines. Fuel typically is the largest variable cost for airlines. United also said that its only currency hedge going forward into 2015 is on the euro.

54,"   By Jeffrey Dastin  United Continental Holdings Inc is looking to lock in its fuel costs with new hedges that could last as long as two years, but first it would like to see oil prices stabilize, Chief Financial Officer John Rainey said in an interview.U.S. airlines such as United have been burned after hedging against rising oil prices only to see prices fall, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars owed to counterparties on the winning side of the bets.The recent oil glut, which pushed down global prices some 60 percent from a peak of about $115 per barrel in June, has prompted airlines including United to pay premiums to close out losing hedges. United said it still expects $701 million in hedge losses this year.But with prices shooting up about $10 to around $60 per barrel beginning in late January, Rainey said United is looking to place new hedges in case prices soar again.""Sixty dollars is an attractive price. It's just that you really can't place a hedge outside of this period for $60,"" Rainey said in an interview on Monday, noting that the price of oil in the longer term is now higher than the price for the near-term and that options have gone up in price. ""Seventy dollars is an attractive price too, but we want to be fairly prudent with how we spend our money on hedging. ... We really want to see the market settle a little bit,"" he said.""Fuel's got to go up $20 from where it is today to make money on that hedge,"" he said, referring to a $10 option. ""So it's not that attractive."" Fuel typically represents a third of airlines' total operating costs. Overall, the plunge in oil prices has benefited airlines. Rainey said that every $1 drop in the price per barrel lowers the carrier's operating expenses by about $93 million, excluding the impact of hedge losses.While companies often cover just several months of their fuel consumption with hedges at a given time, Rainey said United could benefit from a position that lasts longer.""We would look out as far as probably two years,"" he said.

55,"   By Jeffrey Dastin | March 4  March 4 United Continental Holdings Inc  is looking to lock in its fuel costs with new hedges that could last as long as two years, but first it would like to see oil prices stabilize, Chief Financial Officer John Rainey said in an interview.U.S. airlines such as United have been burned after hedging against rising oil prices only to see prices fall, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars owed to counterparties on the winning side of the bets.The recent oil glut, which pushed down global prices some 60 percent from a peak of about $115 per barrel in June, has prompted airlines including United to pay premiums to close out losing hedges. United said it still expects $701 million in hedge losses this year.But with prices shooting up about $10 to around $60 per barrel beginning in late January, Rainey said United is looking to place new hedges in case prices soar again. ""Sixty dollars is an attractive price. It's just that you really can't place a hedge outside of this period for $60,"" Rainey said in an interview on Monday, noting that the price of oil in the longer term is now higher than the price for the near-term and that options have gone up in price.""Seventy dollars is an attractive price too, but we want to be fairly prudent with how we spend our money on hedging. ... We really want to see the market settle a little bit,"" he said. ""Fuel's got to go up $20 from where it is today to make money on that hedge,"" he said, referring to a $10 option. ""So it's not that attractive.""Fuel typically represents a third of airlines' total operating costs. Overall, the plunge in oil prices has benefited airlines. Rainey said that every $1 drop in the price per barrel lowers the carrier's operating expenses by about $93 million, excluding the impact of hedge losses. While companies often cover just several months of their fuel consumption with hedges at a given time, Rainey said United could benefit from a position that lasts longer.""We would look out as far as probably two years,"" he said.However, he cautioned that some analysts say oil prices could drop further.""I'm not one to ... guess and try to pick the bottom of the market, but there were people that told me to hedge at $95 and at $85 and at $75,"" Rainey said.

The Chicago-based airline earned $508 million last quarter. Excluding special items, it earned $582 million, or $1.52 per diluted share, compared with analysts' average estimate of $1.44 per diluted share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Facing markets where travelers' spending power has been hurt by the strong dollar or energy sector weakness, United lowered its forecast for capacity growth this year to between 1 and 2 percent, down from its March forecast of 1.5 to 2.5 percent.United said the dollar, weak demand from the energy sector and lower fuel surcharges likely will cause its passenger unit revenue to fall between 4 and 6 percent this quarter, compared with competitor Delta Air Lines Inc's (DAL.N) forecast of a 2 to 4 percent drop.The unit revenue ""guidance is clearly disappointing and what people care about,"" Cowen and Co analyst Helane Becker said in a research note.

Both United and Delta expect to increase capacity by about 3 percent for the current quarter, though Delta said last week  it plans to cut international capacity by 3 percent in the fourth quarter. United said it prepaid $120 million in debt and returned about $200 million to shareholders as part of its $1 billion stock buy-back program. It generated $1 billion in free cash flow. The company also said it has swapped 10 orders of Boeing Co (BA.N) 787 Dreamliners for 10 larger 777-300ER jets, marking a victory for the plane manufacturer as it seeks to sell out the 777 planes before their production ends.""These changes will not impact the company's current 2015 capacity guidance, and are consistent with the company's focus on capacity discipline,"" the airline said in a filing.

72,"  June 3 United Continental Holdings Inc  has been in talks about purchasing the world's biggest passenger jet from Airbus Group SE, the A380, but at the moment does not see it fitting with its fleet, the airline said Wednesday.The Chicago-based airline confirmed that its chief financial officer, John Rainey, told aviation news outlet Flightglobal: ""We've looked at that and we are looking at it right now  it just doesn't really work for us."" In the report, Rainey said his main concern was the A380's trip cost, which is higher than the trip cost of smaller Boeing Co 787 Dreamliners already in United's fleet. He said flying a route multiple times on smaller aircraft rather than once on a large plane pleases business travelers by giving them more choice.  Last year, no orders were placed by commercial airlines for new Airbus A380s or Boeing's jumbo jet, the 747, underscoring a move in the industry toward smaller, twin-engine planes. The slump in sales has raised questions over how long manufacturers can sustain production.

That compares to when Wall Street forecasted 2015 EBITDA to rise 7 percent to $22.7 billion in June 2014 before fuel costs started to fall.The report said a drop in revenue per available seat, an important metric watched by investors, is a brief bump rather than a sign of a longer-term challenge.

84,"  (Adds analyst comments, detail, byline)By Jeffrey Dastin and Sweta SinghJuly 23 United Continental Holdings Inc  on Thursday forecast a drop in unit revenue and trimmed plans for capacity growth as the U.S. dollar weighs on demand abroad, but it announced new share buybacks because its profit continues to rise.The Chicago-based airline said it expects passenger unit revenue to decrease between 5 and 7 percent in the third quarter. Capacity will only grow between 1 and 1.5 percent in 2015 compared to a year earlier, it said, lowering a prior forecast for growth of as much as 2 percent.Shares rose more than 2 percent in early trade on news of United's plans to buy back $3 billion of its stock. The capacity trim comes as a relief to investors too, who have called on U.S. airlines to limit their growth to match weaker demand. ""Management appears concerned about the decline in unit revenue and is being responsive to weaker demand in some markets,"" Cowen and Co analyst Helane Becker said in a research note, adding that capacity in Brazil, Japan and Scandinavia took some of the largest cuts.United's outlook reflects the challenging revenue environment that U.S. airlines continue to face as the strong dollar lowers foreign travelers' spending power in the United States. Rival Delta Air Lines Inc said last week that it expects passenger unit revenue to decline between 4.5 percent and 6.5 percent in the third quarter. Despite this, United said it expects a pre-tax profit margin between 13.5 percent and 15.5 percent in the third quarter, excluding special items.""The $3 billion share repurchase program we announced today demonstrates the confidence we have in our future,"" Chief Executive Officer Jeff Smisek said in a news release. Sterne Agee CRT analyst Adam Hackel said the move, three times larger than United's last buyback plan, ""signals that the stock is undervalued"" and added that United likely will pay out dividends once valuations improve.United reported a 51 percent rise in second-quarter profit to $1.19 billion. On an adjusted basis, it earned $3.31 per share, in line with analysts' average estimate according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Passenger unit revenue fell 3.4 percent domestically and 5.6 percent in total for the second quarter compared to a year earlier.

From 2003 to 2013, he served as the rail company's chief financial officer.On the call with analysts, Munoz, said he would focus on improving United's performance with customers.""We need to reach our customers with a better service product,"" Munoz said.Smisek will receive a separation payment of $4.9 million, payable as a lump sum in cash, the company said in a regulatory filing. The company also said it will give Smisek stock worth nearly $3.5 million.

97,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK, Sept 17  NEW YORK, Sept 17 A federal appeals court has given the developer Larry Silverstein a new chance to recoup more money for rebuilding the World Trade Center site in New York, on top of the $4.1 billion of insurance proceeds he has received.The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said a lower court judge incorrectly calculated that Silverstein lost just $2.805 billion on his 99-year lease for the site, signed six weeks before the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, and deserved no additional damages because insurance more than offset it.Thursday's decision by a three-judge panel clears the way for Silverstein and his World Trade Center Properties LLC to seek more damages from United Continental Holdings Inc, American Airlines Group Inc, and dozens of financial, real estate and security companies.Silverstein wants those defendants held responsible for their alleged negligence in failing to prevent the destruction of the Twin Towers by hijacked United and American planes.In a 70-page decision for the appeals court, Circuit Judge Debra Ann Livingston said the loss on Silverstein's lease should reflect ""pre- and post-attack market values, with the post-attack values measured as if the leased buildings were not reconstructed."" She also directed U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein, who oversees much of the Sept. 11 litigation and determined the $2.805 billion loss, to award Silverstein a higher rate of interest.The appeals court did hand Silverstein a setback, rejecting his effort to recoup money for rebuilding costs and lost rents. Although Silverstein was able to open One World Trade Center last November, he has said the lease obligated him to continue rebuilding, and that he remains billions of dollars short.""Today's decision re-opens the door for a jury to determine the extent of the airlines' and security companies' responsibility for their negligent actions on 9/11,"" a spokesman for the developer said. ""The American public deserves a full and fair accounting.""Roger Podesta, a lawyer for the defendants, was not immediately available for comment. Circuit Judge Chester Straub partially dissented.He said it was unclear whether New York law permitted Silverstein to recoup rebuilding costs, given his obligation to rebuild the site and the ""public value"" in doing so, and that the state's highest court should be consulted.Separately, the 2nd Circuit said United was not responsible for the destruction of 7 World Trade Center in the Sept. 11 attacks, because it was caused by the American flight.The case is In re: September 11 Litigation, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Nos. 13-3619, 13-3782.

101,"   By Jeffrey Dastin  United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N) on Thursday said it expects a higher pre-tax profit margin for the just-ended third quarter than it had previously forecast, thanks in part to extra revenue from a credit card agreement for frequent fliers.The Chicago-based airline said its pre-tax margin will be between 16 percent and 17 percent, compared with a prior forecast of between 13.5 percent and 15.5 percent, excluding special charges. That reflects about $100 million in revenue from changes to marketing agreements with JPMorgan Chase & Co's (JPM.N) Chase Bank USA and Visa Inc's (V.N) U.S. subsidiary. United also narrowed its outlook for a decline in passenger unit revenue, seeing a decline between 5.5 percent and 6 percent, compared with prior guidance of a drop between 5 percent and 7 percent. Rival Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) reported a similar improvement last week, suggesting that U.S. airlines may start to emerge from a months-long unit-revenue slump. A strong dollar has lowered demand from travelers outside the United States, and smaller surcharges in international markets have decreased the value of sales.

102,"  (Adds reason for improvement, details on cancellations, analyst comment, background, byline)By Jeffrey DastinOct 8 United Continental Holdings Inc on Thursday said it expects a higher pre-tax profit margin for the just-ended third quarter than it had previously forecast, thanks in part to extra revenue from a credit card agreement for frequent fliers. The Chicago-based airline said its pre-tax margin will be between 16 percent and 17 percent, compared with a prior forecast of between 13.5 percent and 15.5 percent, excluding special charges. That reflects about $100 million in revenue from changes to marketing agreements with JPMorgan Chase & Co's  Chase Bank USA and Visa Inc's U.S. subsidiary.United also narrowed its outlook for a decline in passenger unit revenue, seeing a decline between 5.5 percent and 6 percent, compared with prior guidance of a drop between 5 percent and 7 percent. Rival Delta Air Lines Inc reported a similar improvement last week, suggesting that U.S. airlines may start to emerge from a months-long unit-revenue slump. A strong dollar has lowered demand from travelers outside the United States, and smaller surcharges in international markets have decreased the value of sales.

United, the second-largest U.S. airline by capacity, said in a statement that its board ""remains actively engaged in preparing for all potential outcomes regarding the company's leadership structure."" A spokeswoman declined to elaborate.     Hart will make his first presentation to investors as acting chief on Thursday, when the company reports third-quarter results. He joined United in 2010 after working as general counsel of Sara Lee Corp, a consumer goods company.     Munoz, 56, became CEO in September after predecessor Jeff Smisek resigned in relation to internal and federal probes into United's relationship with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.     Munoz spent his first month on the job traversing the United States to meet with workers and air travelers for input on how to improve the airline. Unions have welcomed Munoz, hoping he would push the company to conclude contracts with flight attendants and maintenance workers that have been stalled for years.     On Oct. 15, Munoz suffered a heart attack. United did not disclose that Munoz was hospitalized until the Wall Street Journal reported it the day after, and the company did not confirm widespread reports of a heart attack until Monday night.     The executive's family sent an email to United employees earlier on Monday saying they expect Munoz to have a ""healthy recovery.""     The time lag of United's statements on Munoz's condition had raised concern that United did not disclose information fast enough.     ""It is the obligation of the company to keep the market informed of material developments and this seems clearly material to me,"" said John Coffee, a professor specializing in corporate governance at Columbia University's law school.     However, some shareholders said they understood the airline needed time to ascertain the situation before making disclosures.    United's stock, which is down 15 percent this year, remained nearly unchanged in after-market trade.

The company earlier appointed General Counsel Brett Hart as acting CEO and said its board had been preparing for ""all potential outcomes"" resulting from Munoz's hospitalization on Oct. 15.""I am on the road to recovery,"" Munoz said in a statement. ""My time away will be a little longer than I would like, but based upon discussion with my doctors I will be back in the first quarter.""Shares were unchanged in after-market trading following the news. Munoz took over as CEO in September with aims to rebuild morale after years of strained labor relations. He spent his first month on the job criss-crossing the United States to hear from employees and travelers how to improve the airline. His predecessor Jeff Smisek resigned because of probes into United's relationship with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which focused on whether the company added flights to Columbia, South Carolina to curry favor with then-Port Authority Chairman David Samson, who had a home there.Hart has promised to continue Munoz's agenda. However, S&P Capital IQ cut its rating on the company's stock to ""Buy"" from ""Strong Buy"" because it believed Hart had limited experience in finance, operations or customer service.Under Hart, the company has put forward a tentative deal for maintenance workers, paving the way for the first contract covering technicians from both United and Continental since the airlines merged in 2010. Last week United said it would not outsource more jobs in baggage handling or customer service at least until 2017, following a round of airport outsourcing this year.""It's definitely not too late"" for Munoz to make change, Sterne Agee CRT analyst Adam Hackel said.Still, Munoz will face a host of challenges upon his return. Chicago-based United had the worst customer satisfaction of any North American airline, with the exception of low-cost carrier Frontier, according to J.D. Power's 2015 ranking. That's in part thanks to a higher rate of late arrivals than peers.Smisek's team started addressing this by scheduling more planes to fly back and forth from hubs rather than circulating through multiple cities, so that winter storms would not have a ripple effect.

155,"   By Henning Gloystein and Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen | SINGAPORE  SINGAPORE Jan 29 U.S. airline United Continental will launch a direct flight from Singapore to San Francisco in June as low oil prices make ultra-long flights attractive again.The route, at 8,446 miles (13,592 km), will be the longest scheduled flight operated by any U.S. carrier, and it will be served by two-engine Boeing 787 passenger jets, Chicago-based United Continental Holdings Inc said in a statement on Friday.""United will be the first airline to offer nonstop service between San Francisco and Singapore, and this will be the only nonstop service to the U.S. from Singapore,"" the company said, adding that daily flights are planned to start on June 1, 2016.United said that the scheduled flight time was 15 hours, 30 minutes to 16 hours, 20 minutes. But, the westbound crossing to Singapore will arrive in Asia two days after leaving the United States because of the large time zone differences.Flights from Singapore to the U.S. West Coast typically have to make at least one stop-over, usually in Tokyo, Hong Kong or Seoul. By flying directly, these airports stand to lose business. United currently flies from Singapore to San Francisco with connections in either Tokyo's Narita Airport or Hong Kong. The airline said it would end its flights between Singapore and Narita in June, but maintain its Singapore-Hong Kong flights.Singapore Airlines also plans to re-launch direct flights to the United States, starting with Los Angeles and New York, although it will have to wait until 2018 when it takes delivery of its next generation Airbus A350 ultra-long haul planes. Analysts said that the 70 percent crash in crude oil prices  was a significant reason that long-haul flights are profitable again.""Lower fuel prices certainly help the economics for ultra long-range flying,"" said Singapore-based analyst Brendan Sobie at aviation consultancy CAPA.With access to new technology, several airlines have been studying the U.S. to Singapore route after Singapore Airlines stopped flying between Singapore and New York, he said. ""It has always been an attractive market from a demand perspective, but I think it has been a cost issue and a matter of having the right aircraft,"" said Sobie.Singapore Airlines stopped direct flights to Los Angeles in 2013, when Brent crude futures averaged $108.70 per barrel, compared with just over $34 currently.The airline flew the four-engine Airbus A340-500 on the route that used too much fuel to make it a profitable service.Like Boeing's 787, the Airbus A350 is a two-engine plane, and both are designed to be more fuel efficient than previous models.

The CSeries, a new carbon-composite aircraft whose two models seat between 100 and 160 passengers, is due to enter service in 2016 after years of delays and budget overruns.A spokeswoman for the Montreal-based plane and train-maker declined to comment on the United deal.

The Boeing aircraft also burn less fuel per passenger than the 50-seaters and have space for multiple cabin classes, giving United the chance to up-sell to customers.

163,"  Feb 22 United Continental Holdings Inc  is nearing a second deal to purchase narrowbody aircraft from Boeing Co, potentially dealing a blow to smaller planemakers Bombardier Inc and Embraer SA, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday.In January, the airline said it would order 40 small planes from Boeing for $3.2 billion at list prices, and a United executive said the company would continue to look at additional aircraft orders.Citing two people familiar with the aircraft negotiations, the Journal said the number of planes in United's latest planned order was not immediately known. A decision by the Chicago-based airline to pick Boeing's single-aisle jets could appear a lost opportunity for Canada's Bombardier, which has sought orders from a big name such as United or Delta Air Lines Inc as it prepares its flagship CSeries jets to enter service after delays and cash problems. Last week Bombardier received its first order in 16 months for the planes, with Air Canada signing a letter of intent to purchase 45 and maintain the option to buy 30 more. A United spokeswoman said on Monday that the airline does not discuss its future fleet plans. A Boeing spokesman said the planemaker does not discuss conversations with any of its customers.Bombardier was not immediately available to comment. Embraer declined to comment.

United said it had tried to work with the funds and even offered to amend its bylaws to extend the deadline for board nominations, but they were ""uninterested"" in an agreement.The two funds built stakes in United last year, and talks with the carrier intensified in late 2015, said a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. The funds did not return calls seeking comment.SHAKING UP THE BOARD ""This situation is really all about shaking up what Altimeter/PAR thinks is an entrenched and ineffective board,"" said Don Bilson, head of event-driven research at independent research firm Gordon Haskett.United has posted relatively weak earnings, among other problems. It lost $724 million in 2012, when rival Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) posted more than $1 billion in profit. In 2013, United earned $539 million, compared with Delta's $10 billion profit. Former United CEO Jeff Smisek stepped down in September following the disclosure of a federal investigation into the airline's dealings with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The fund's plan to change United's board came two days after the airline said Munoz would return on March 14 after being on medical leave since October, when he suffered a heart attack.On Monday, United added three independent directors to its board, increasing the size. The company said some directors would step down but declined to say which ones or how many. ""PAR and Altimeter have unilaterally taken this hostile action with no concern that a proxy fight could distract the company from executing on Oscar's strategic plan,"" United Non-Executive Chairman Henry Meyer said on Tuesday.But the investors said the board changes, together with an increased stock buyback plan, were not enough.""Yesterday's last-ditch effort – adding just three people to its now 15-person board – is a cynical attempt to preserve power by this entrenched board,"" Gerstner said in a statement.Other investors said the proposal would have little immediate impact.""Today's news doesn't affect our view of the company's credit profile or its trajectory,"" said Jonathan Root, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service, which rates United three notches below investment grade, with a positive outlook.

171,"   By Jeffrey Dastin and Alwyn Scott | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The two hedge funds that launched a boardroom fight with United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N) last week oppose the airline's plans to give Chief Executive Oscar Munoz the additional role of chairman and have concerns about his compensation, according to a person familiar with the matter.The funds, PAR Capital Management Inc and Altimeter Capital Management LP, on Tuesday described United's performance as ""inexcusable"" and asked shareholders to consider six new directors for the company's board, including former Continental Airlines chief Gordon Bethune.They are expected to lay out more specific claims about the company in coming weeks that address what they believe are the causes of the No. 3 U.S. airline's low customer satisfaction scores and its sagging stock, down almost 14 percent in the past 12 months.The funds, which together own 7.1 percent of United, have said they support Munoz as CEO, but their doubts about United's pay policies and its plan to make him chairman could become a flashpoint as the long-running struggle over the airline's management develops. United has refused to appoint Bethune as chairman, ending months of talks with the funds in early March, the source and two other people familiar with the matter said. That refusal led the funds to take their objections public last week, the sources said.United declined comment on the talks. The activist investors question whether Munoz, a former  president at railroad operator CSX Corp (CSX.O), was guided well by United's board in allowing him to spend his first weeks after starting the job in September talking to the media and workers rather than focusing on capital allocation, for example, the first source said.The two funds called the board ""underqualified"" last week because it lacked what they consider experienced airline executives.United rejected the criticism, saying Munoz was ""focused on getting out on the front line to enhance the customer and employee experience at United, and the results are evident in our improved operational and financial performance."" United's unions representing pilots, machinists and flight attendants are supporting Munoz.PAR and Altimeter also believe the board's decision to give Munoz a signing bonus of $12 million should have been tied to performance goals, the person familiar with the situation said. United declined to comment on that criticism, though in a filing it had said the award partially accounted for pay Munoz forfeited at CSX.The funds are set to oppose United's plan to make Munoz chairman by 2017, as specified in his employment contract signed while Munoz was on medical leave after a mid-October heart attack, the source said.Such an arrangement has been criticized by corporate governance experts, but it is not unusual in the United States. Just over half of S&P 500 companies had the same CEO and chairman last year, down from 71 percent a decade ago, according to executive search firm Spencer Stuart.United's current chairman, Henry Meyer, is a retired financial services executive.

183,"   By Jeffrey Dastin  Alaska Air Group Inc's (ALK.N) plan to buy Virgin America Inc VA.O makes the company a more attractive partner to Asian airlines looking for extra revenue from connecting passengers to flights within the United States, industry executives and experts say.Foreign airlines could market Alaska Air's U.S. flights to their customers in Asia and take a commission for those sales - a common airline practice called code-sharing. Travelers from Asia would earn frequent flyer miles under their preferred airline's loyalty program even while traveling on Alaska Air.Seattle-based Alaska Air said its $2.6 billion purchase of Virgin America, based in California, gives it 22 percent of seats on North America flights from the U.S. West Coast, more than any other airline. California was the No.1 U.S. destination for visitors from Asia in 2014, according to U.S. Commerce Department data.""We'll be a very desirable partner for these international airlines,"" Alaska Air's Chief Executive Officer Brad Tilden said on an investor call Monday. The company's effort to woo Asian airline code-sharing partners comes as Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N), United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N) and American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O) are competing more aggressively with Asian airlines for trans-Pacific passengers.

184,"   By Jeffrey Dastin  Alaska Air Group Inc's (ALK.N) plan to buy Virgin America Inc VA.O makes the company a more attractive partner to Asian airlines looking for extra revenue from connecting passengers to flights within the United States, industry executives and experts say.Foreign airlines could market Alaska Air's U.S. flights to their customers in Asia and take a commission for those sales - a common airline practice called code-sharing. Travelers from Asia would earn frequent flyer miles under their preferred airline's loyalty program even while traveling on Alaska Air.Seattle-based Alaska Air said its $2.6 billion purchase of Virgin America, based in California, gives it 22 percent of seats on North America flights from the U.S. West Coast, more than any other airline. California was the No.1 U.S. destination for visitors from Asia in 2014, according to U.S. Commerce Department data.""We'll be a very desirable partner for these international airlines,"" Alaska Air's Chief Executive Officer Brad Tilden said on an investor call Monday. The company's effort to woo Asian airline code-sharing partners comes as Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N), United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N) and American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O) are competing more aggressively with Asian airlines for trans-Pacific passengers. Each of the three carriers said in the past month that it intends to add a route to China.The Alaska-Virgin deal is ""definitely a positive"" for independent carriers abroad - those who are not in marketing alliances with the three big U.S. carriers, said Joel Chusid, the U.S. executive director for China's Hainan Airlines Co Ltd (600221.SS).""With Alaska, we're helping each other.

United has also disclosed two government probes related to the matter. United spokeswoman Megan McCarthy said in a statement that the company did not have anything to add beyond what it had disclosed.The proxy statement said its separation agreement with Jeff Smisek, made effective on Sept. 8, gave the outgoing chief executive $36.8 million in severance payments and benefits. His successor, Oscar Munoz, abstained from voting on the separation agreement between United and Smisek, according to the filing.

207,"   By Jeffrey Dastin | June 2  June 2 United Continental Holdings Inc  said on Thursday it will overhaul its international business class in an effort to win over high-spending travelers and chip away at its reputation as industry-lagging.United, the No.3 U.S. airline by traffic, said it will open nine business class-only lounges in the United States, Europe and Asia so customers can eat a full meal before their flight. It then will offer a shorter meal service on board and seats with privacy walls so customers can maximize their sleep time.The revamp, to be rolled out from December, is United's latest attempt to rival Delta Air Lines Inc, which has renovated its plane cabins, canceled fewer flights and posted an operating profit margin about twice United's last quarter. United said the private lounges will be a first for a U.S. carrier. Additionally, its Boeing Co 777-300ER planes will have a walk-up bar.In an interview, Chief Executive Oscar Munoz said United is not prioritizing business over economy-class passengers. Rather, the upgrade was already scheduled in part due to upcoming plane deliveries. ""Philosophically, I don't care if you're flying us once a year or a hundred times a year,"" he said. ""I'm going to treat you as well as I can.""Since Munoz took the airline's top job in September, United has arrived more flights on time and added free snacks and better coffee for economy-cabin passengers. Munoz has said he wants United to be disruptive in the industry, though he has yet to detail how: his work was delayed by a five-month medical leave and a now-resolved fight over United's board composition. Munoz declined to disclose the cost of the new long-haul class, known as United Polaris.A critical component of it - service by flight attendants - comes as United seeks to clinch a contract with them this week, the last meetings on schedule for federal mediation. United and Continental flight attendants have operated separately since the carriers merged in 2010. ""Products and services are meaningless without the people who introduce them to customers,"" said Sara Nelson, international president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, in a statement.Munoz, who has made a point of securing new labor contracts, said the business class is something flight attendants can be proud of.United Polaris will launch on Dec. 1, with the rollout continuing in 2017 and beyond as the airline takes delivery of Boeing 787-10 and Airbus Group SE A350-1000 aircraft.Munoz said United has visited the company that is building the seats for the new service, Zodiac Aerospace SA, and has been assured there will not be production delays.

209,"  June 3 Avianca Holdings SA's   U.S.-listed shares jumped as much as 23 percent on Friday after reports that United Continental Holdings Inc and Delta Air Lines Inc were weighing bids for the airline.Avianca, one of Latin America's largest airlines, is seeking an investment of $500 million that could develop into a sale of the company, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.Latin American airlines have been hit by economic woes and a slump in the value of currencies in the region, and have shifted flights away from countries such as Brazil and Venezuela to growing economies such as Peru.Moreover, oil firms cutting back on corporate travel has led to lower demand for seats in premium cabins. Last month, Avianca reported a 90 percent slump in net profit for the first quarter ended March 31, hurt by currency losses.The company said earlier this year it would hold off on taking delivery of new planes as it looks to weather the region's economic downturn with a conservative strategy and cut costs. Fitch downgraded Avianca's rating to ""B"" from ""BB-"" in March, saying any material recovery in the company's credit profile will remain challenging in the short to medium term amid a difficult operating environment.The airline, with a market capitalization of about $680 million, is a key player in South and Central America. Avianca was originally established as a strategic alliance between Aerovias del Continente Americano SA and Grupo TACA Holdings Ltd. The company went public in 2011.Avianca could not be immediately reached for comments, while  United and Delta did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Avianca's U.S.-listed shares, that have nearly halved in value in the past one year, were up 16.6 percent at $6.04 on the New York Stock Exchange.

The estimate of the operating income gain marks a new push by United for transparency with investors, who have sought details on how it intends to match Delta in on-time arrivals, satisfaction scores and profit margins.

224,"  United Continental Holdings Inc warned on Tuesday it expects to write off a quarter billion dollars in assets because a U.S. regulatory decision allowing more take-offs and landings in Newark, New Jersey, diminished the value of the airlines's slots there.United will record a non-cash charge of $412 million in the second quarter, or $264 million after income taxes, associated with its slots at Newark Liberty International Airport, it said in a regulatory filing. United is Newark's largest airline, scheduling nearly three quarters of its flights.The charge follows a decision by the U.S. Federal Aviation (FAA) Administration to allow more flights beginning Oct. 30 at Newark - currently capped at 81 aircraft movements per hour - because congestion had eased.United has said the move may cause crowding and delays. The FAA ruling also prompted United to scrap plans to lease 24 additional Newark slots from Delta Air Lines Inc - a deal that the U.S. Justice Department had opposed on the grounds it would strengthen United's grip on the airport and lead to higher fares. In the filing, United said its existing Newark slots were used as part of the collateral on loans under a 2013 credit agreement and its credit card marketing deal with Chase Bank USA. Those agreements have since been revised with no extra collateral required, the airline said. United, the No.3 U.S. carrier by passenger traffic, expects total special charges of $278 million after income taxes for the second quarter - equaling about 23 percent of its income in the same period a year ago.

236,"   By David Shepardson | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Four U.S. carriers have won tentative approval to launch daytime U.S. flights to Tokyo's Haneda airport as early as this fall, the U.S. Transportation Department said on Wednesday.Delta Air Lines, American Airlines Group Inc, Hawaiian Holdings Inc and United Continental Holdings Inc would gain the rights for flights that depart or land in the day at Haneda, which is closer to Tokyo than Narita International Airport, the department said in a statement. U.S. business travelers and tourists prefer to be at airports in the day.Prior to a U.S.-Japan agreement in February, U.S. carriers could only leave and land in Haneda at late hours in the night.Approvals were given to Delta for flights from Los Angeles and Minneapolis, Hawaiian from Honolulu, American from Los Angeles, and United from San Francisco. Except for Minneapolis, the cities already had night-time flights to Haneda.A final decision will be issued after a public comment period, the department said. Service must begin within 90 days after the decision. The Transportation Department said in a written order that if Delta scaled back its Minneapolis flight plans, the government would cancel the authority and give the flight to American in Dallas.Other airlines have questioned if there was enough traffic to support a Minneapolis route. The department rejected requests for Haneda flights from Dallas by American Airlines, Newark by United and Delta from Atlanta.American Airlines spokesman Matt Miller said in an email that the carrier was disappointed that the Dallas flight was not approved and it was considering all options. The airline could file objections to the decision before it is final.In 2010, the Transportation Department selected Delta's Detroit-Haneda service proposal for night-time service, but after less than two years in operation it was canceled in 2012 and moved to Seattle. Delta discontinued the Seattle flight in 2015, saying it was not commercially feasible.  (Reporting by David Shepardson.

239,"   By Jeffrey Dastin  United Continental Holdings Inc said on Friday it has scored labor deals with its flight attendants and its mechanics, whose relations with the airline were strained in recent years as the parties struggled to conclude contract talks.Flight attendants at the airline voted to approve a contract that will hike their wages between 18 percent and 31 percent in September, their union said on Friday. Some 53 percent of those who voted backed the deal.Separately, negotiators from the airline and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters reached a labor deal in the last round of U.S. mediated talks on schedule, the parties said in a joint statement on Friday. They said they must finalize the contract language before it becomes a so-called ""tentative agreement"" that the carrier's 9,000 mechanics can vote to ratify or reject.Both announcements mark major steps toward integrating United and Continental, which merged in 2010, and reducing flight cancellations.Maintenance technicians from United have yet to mix their operations with those from Continental. The same holds true for flight attendants.With their new contract, United and the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA said they now expect the flight attendant  groups to combine within 12 to 18 months. That agreement was reached in June, also under the guidance of the U.S. National Mediation Board, following months of protests by the workers and years of talks. In addition to pay raises, the contract provides better healthcare and job protection for the company's 25,000 flight attendants, the union said.Both labor deals represented a victory for Chief Executive Oscar Munoz, who took over the helm in September and has sought harmony with workers for the No. 3 U.S. airline by passenger traffic.United shares edged down 0.3 percent to close at $47.10. ""The contract provides immediate economic gains, sets a new industry standard and ensures flight attendants can achieve the benefits of a fully integrated airline,"" Sara Nelson, AFA-CWA's international president, said in a statement.More than 90 percent of eligible flight attendants voted, the union said.Flight crew protested furloughs by the airline after the merger. But starting in 2014, United offered voluntary buyouts that more than 2,500 employees have accepted. United and Continental crews had been staffing separate flights since the merger. When a flight on a pre-merger United plane was short-staffed, pre-merger Continental employees could not be brought in, and vice versa, sometimes leading to cancellations.United ranked lowest among U.S. and Canadian rivals in 2016 for customer satisfaction, according to a J.D.

Both announcements mark major steps toward integrating United and Continental, which merged in 2010, and reducing flight cancellations.Maintenance technicians from United have yet to mix their operations with those from Continental. The same holds true for flight attendants.With their new contract, United and the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA said they now expect the flight attendant  groups to combine within 12 to 18 months. That agreement was reached in June, also under the guidance of the U.S. National Mediation Board, following months of protests by the workers and years of talks. In addition to pay raises, the contract provides better healthcare and job protection for the company's 25,000 flight attendants, the union said.Both labor deals represented a victory for Chief Executive Oscar Munoz, who took over the helm in September and has sought harmony with workers for the No. 3 U.S. airline by passenger traffic.United shares edged down 0.3 percent to close at $47.10.""The contract provides immediate economic gains, sets a new industry standard and ensures flight attendants can achieve the benefits of a fully integrated airline,"" Sara Nelson, AFA-CWA's international president, said in a statement. More than 90 percent of eligible flight attendants voted, the union said.Flight crew protested furloughs by the airline after the merger. But starting in 2014, United offered voluntary buyouts that more than 2,500 employees have accepted.United and Continental crews had been staffing separate flights since the merger. When a flight on a pre-merger United plane was short-staffed, pre-merger Continental employees could not be brought in, and vice versa, sometimes leading to cancellations. United ranked lowest among U.S. and Canadian rivals in 2016 for customer satisfaction, according to a J.D. Power study.""What this means is hopefully a much more reliable United, a much more on-time United and hopefully also a more pleasant United for its customers to fly,"" said Henry Harteveldt, founder of the travel consultancy Atmosphere Research Group.Munoz said in a statement he was helping ""turn the page and write a new chapter in our approach to labor and management relations at United,"" alluding to deals he helped secure for pilots, gate agents and baggage handlers.In February, United's mechanics rejected a contract offer, and their union said it would seek approval from U.S. regulators to strike.

261,"   By Ingrid Melander and Tim Hepher | PARIS  PARIS Thousands of passengers were delayed worldwide after a computer glitch temporarily halted departures at United Airlines, the latest in a series of outages to affect rival companies in the industry.United said on Twitter that an issue with its weight reporting system delayed flights starting Thursday, and it resolved the problem by 3 AM EDT (07:00 GMT) on Friday. The No.3 U.S. airline by passenger traffic is working to determine the cause, its spokesman said Friday.Weight and balance systems calculate a plane's centre of gravity and if it is carrying no more than it can handle to fly.On Friday, delays often lasted 10 to 20 minutes due to United's crew having to handle some tasks manually, the spokesman said. But some passengers reported they had to wait aboard planes or inside terminals for several hours.""On the plane for more than an hour, away from the gate and no communication. What's happening?,"" one passenger tweeted.In Paris, passengers complained as check-in lines grew for a flight to New York, a Reuters reporter said on Friday morning. As of 5:00 PM EDT (21:00 GMT), United had cancelled 11 flights and delayed 216, or 9 percent of its operation, according to flight tracking website FlightAware.com.The large size of global airlines and their need to automate systems to be reliable mean recovering from glitches will almost always take some time, despite investment and redundancies, said Bob Edwards, United's former chief information officer until 2014.This is the third computer glitch recently to hit United's owner United Continental Holdings Inc and the latest in a series of problems that have tested airlines' reliance on aging technology. This has prompted some experts to question whether the airline industry has invested enough in technology infrastructure, given new profits from baggage and cancellation fees.On June 2, 2015 software needed to dispatch United's flight plan briefly lost functionality.In July 2015, the same airline's flights were disrupted after a computer problem blocked access to reservations records. This August, Delta Air Lines Inc cancelled thousands of flights and delayed many others after a power outage hit its computer systems.And in September, a system-wide computer problem at British Airways caused significant delays.After the previous incidents, United said it had invested in backup plans.

263,"   By Jeffrey Dastin  United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N) on Monday said cheap airfares and higher wages from new contracts will squeeze its results this fall, making it difficult to be as profitable as competitors.United, the No. 3 U.S. airline by passenger traffic, said profit fell 80 percent to $965 million in the third quarter, due to a one-time accounting gain last year related to taxes. The airline's income fell 6 percent on a pre-tax basis and topped what analysts were expecting on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.While plummeting fuel costs led to a blockbuster rise in U.S. airline earnings since 2014, oil prices have to a degree plateaued, no longer masking drops in revenue.Budget carriers like Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA (NWC.OL) are fighting larger airlines over a fixed number of travelers to Europe - and charging less per ticket.United is offering fewer seats across the Atlantic this fall to prop up prices and overall is optimistic about revenue in coming months, Chief Commercial Officer Julia Haywood told reporters Monday on a conference call. The airline expects passenger unit revenue, which compares sales to how many seats United flies and how far it flies them, to decline between 4 percent and 6 percent in the fourth quarter - a notch better than the 5.8 percent drop it posted for the third quarter.But new labor deals may delay United's goal to match the margins of No.2 Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N), which are about twice as large.United and Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) ""face the most cost pressure in 2017 from contracts ratified in 2016 among the large airlines, but both are ending long, painful negotiating processes and achieving gains in key contracts,"" Credit Suisse analyst Julie Yates said in a recent research note. For instance, a new contract for United's flight attendants raised wages between 18 percent and 31 percent in September. Labor costs make up the lion's share of United's forecast for unit costs to increase between 4.75 percent and 5.75 percent, excluding fuel and other charges.""We think it's going to be a real advantage for us,"" Chief Financial Officer Andrew Levy said of the labor deals, noting benefits they will bring from work groups integrating.United expects an adjusted pre-tax profit margin of 5 percent to 7 percent for the fourth quarter, about half the year-ago level. Investors are looking to see if United can pass higher labor costs on to customers through fare hikes, said Adam Hackel of Imperial Capital LLC.Shares were unchanged in after-hours trading.

267,"   By Jeffrey Dastin  A glut of seats on transatlantic flights may weigh on United Continental Holdings Inc's (UAL.N) results through all of 2017, the president of the third largest U.S. carrier by traffic said on Tuesday.Attacks in Europe have hurt travel demand, and a weaker sterling has dampened sales to British travelers in dollar terms, United said in a regulatory filing earlier on Tuesday.United and other established airlines have also been forced to cut prices as Gulf carriers such as Emirates [EMIRA.UL] and budget airlines like Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA (NWC.OL) have added flights to the United States.As a result, President Scott Kirby told analysts on a conference call, it was unclear whether a key revenue measure would stop declining in 2017 for transatlantic flights.Kirby's remarks came a day after United released third-quarter results, which showed a 6 percent drop in pretax income, partly due to higher wages.For Europe, the measure, called passenger unit revenue, is expected to fall between 7.5 percent and 10.5 percent in the fourth quarter, according to the filing. It compares passenger revenue to flight distance and number of seats. For Norwegian alone, the number of one-way flights across the Atlantic has risen 44 percent to 2,916 this year, according to schedules as of Sept. 9 from air travel intelligence company OAG.That is dwarfed by United's more than 22,000 transatlantic flights, but the competition is undermining efforts by legacy carriers to shrink capacity and firm up prices.Transatlantic service has only accounted for 19 percent of United's flight capacity this year. Passenger unit revenue for flights to Asia, which account for about 16 percent of United's capacity, will grow in 2017, Kirby said. For Latin America, the measure will rise between 2 and 5 percent in the fourth quarter, according to the filing.United's biggest market, the United States, is improving as well.Some 43 percent of domestic routes posted a rise in unit revenue in the third quarter from a year ago, Kirby said. Corporate travelers are also booking more expensive last-minute fares. The airline plans to fine-tune how it prices flights relative to demand, he said.Kirby, who joined United from American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O) in late August, said the company lacks an automated process for measuring how demand forecasts compare to actual results.""As great as people are, you can't do that as well as a robust system with thousands and millions of data points,"" Kirby said.

268,"  Oct 18 United Continental Holdings Inc  expects a glut of seats for sale across the Atlantic, attacks in Europe and a weaker British pound will continue to hurt its results, the airline said in a filing Tuesday that added details to a forecast it made a day earlier.United, the No.3 U.S. airline by passenger traffic, said it expects passenger unit revenue in the fourth quarter will fall between 7.5 percent and 10.5 percent from a year earlier for trans-Atlantic flights. The measure, which compares sales to how many seats an airline flies and how far it flies them, fell 10.7 percent for the region in the third quarter.  The Chicago-based company on Monday forecast a 4 percent to 6 percent drop for all flights combined in the fourth quarter, though it expects to get some relief from corporate travelers booking higher last-minute fares for U.S. domestic trips.  The region showing the most improvement was Latin America, with an expected passenger unit revenue rise of 2 percent to 5 percent, United said Tuesday.

269,"   By Jeffrey Dastin  United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N) on Monday said cheap airfares and higher wages from new contracts will squeeze its results this fall, making it difficult to be as profitable as competitors.United, the No. 3 U.S. airline by passenger traffic, said profit fell 80 percent to $965 million in the third quarter, due to a one-time accounting gain last year related to taxes. The airline's income fell 6 percent on a pre-tax basis and topped what analysts were expecting on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.While plummeting fuel costs led to a blockbuster rise in U.S. airline earnings since 2014, oil prices have to a degree plateaued, no longer masking drops in revenue.Budget carriers like Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA (NWC.OL) are fighting larger airlines over a fixed number of travelers to Europe - and charging less per ticket.United is offering fewer seats across the Atlantic this fall to prop up prices and overall is optimistic about revenue in coming months, Chief Commercial Officer Julia Haywood told reporters Monday on a conference call. The airline expects passenger unit revenue, which compares sales to how many seats United flies and how far it flies them, to decline between 4 percent and 6 percent in the fourth quarter - a notch better than the 5.8 percent drop it posted for the third quarter.But new labor deals may delay United's goal to match the margins of No.2 Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N), which are about twice as large.United and Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) ""face the most cost pressure in 2017 from contracts ratified in 2016 among the large airlines, but both are ending long, painful negotiating processes and achieving gains in key contracts,"" Credit Suisse analyst Julie Yates said in a recent research note. For instance, a new contract for United's flight attendants raised wages between 18 percent and 31 percent in September. Labor costs make up the lion's share of United's forecast for unit costs to increase between 4.75 percent and 5.75 percent, excluding fuel and other charges.""We think it's going to be a real advantage for us,"" Chief Financial Officer Andrew Levy said of the labor deals, noting benefits they will bring from work groups integrating.United expects an adjusted pre-tax profit margin of 5 percent to 7 percent for the fourth quarter, about half the year-ago level. Investors are looking to see if United can pass higher labor costs on to customers through fare hikes, said Adam Hackel of Imperial Capital LLC.Shares were unchanged in after-hours trading.

274,"   By Jeffrey Dastin  United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N) took a leaf out of its low-cost competitors' playbook on Tuesday by unveiling a new low fare that limits customers to one carry-on bag that fits under a seat, part of a broader plan to boost profit over the next four years.Chicago-based United is the first major U.S. carrier to make such a move for carry-ons, which it hopes will attract some new customers and push some of its regular flyers toward higher fares.Combined with better flight connections and revamped pricing algorithms, the airline said at its investor day that it aims to add $4.8 billion to yearly operating income by 2020, excluding the effect of rising wages.The new fare class, known as 'Basic Economy,' risks frustrating flyers who already feel burdened with airline travel restrictions and fees, but could push some customers - especially those with large luggage - toward higher-priced fares.The No. 3 U.S. airline by passenger traffic will begin selling the no-frills fares in the first quarter of 2017 for travel starting in the second quarter. Prices will be comparable to low fares it now charges for the economy cabin, but with more restrictions.United said Basic Economy customers would not be assigned seats until the day of departure, meaning people on the same ticket may be split apart.""Flights do run pretty full today. You’re probably going to get a middle seat,"" United's President Scott Kirby said in an interview.CARRY-ON SCRAMBLE  Survey data indicated travelers and employees do not like scrambling to stow carry-ons when overhead bin space is limited, Kirby said. United believes the new fare creates more options for customers, and should not provoke a backlash. Charlie Leocha, chairman of consumer advocacy group Travelers United, took a different view.""This action clearly shows how airline consolidation is eliminating choice,"" he said in an email. A single carrier's decision now means more customers are impacted.Those who book Basic Economy on United will be barred from carrying on bags that can only fit in overhead bins, and they will not accrue miles toward elite status. Fare initiatives will account for $1 billion of United's income target, as more customers pay to check bags or select higher fares that give them two ""free"" carry-ons. And airlines still have ample room to invent fare packages they can sell to customers, Kirby said.""It is ridiculous that we will sell a seat for $49 and a seat next to it for $800, and we treat them exactly the same, just because they book later in the process. There’s no other industry in the world I can think of that does something like that,"" he said. United shares closed up nearly 5 percent. Part of the rise may be from billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), which disclosed stakes in four U.S. airlines including United on Monday, boosting investor confidence in the sector.LOW-COST RIVALS United's announcement follows a similar decision by Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) in 2014 to sell more tickets that are cheap but prohibit itinerary changes and seat selection.Delta and United are hoping to lure customers away from low-cost carriers with competitive prices and upsell them once they reveal the conditions of the ticket. The practice of marketing cheap tickets that become expensive once add-ons like carry-on bags are included had helped companies like Spirit Airlines Inc (SAVE.O) and Frontier Airlines undercut their bigger rivals, until the likes of Delta borrowed from their playbook.Frontier was lowest for customer satisfaction in J.D. Power's North American airline survey in 2016. Spirit was not included in the survey.United's latest move appears to be the most restrictive yet for a large airline's basic economy fare, said Bob Mann, an airline industry analyst at R.W. Mann & Co.Mann said United still had some way to go before it matched the profit of Delta, the No. 2 U.S. airline, whose margins are about twice those of United. American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), the biggest U.S. carrier, is expected to launch its basic economy product early next year.It was unclear if the move by United would prompt similar bag limits from rivals. However, airlines have frequently copied each other, as when they added fees for checked luggage in the last decade. Delta declined to comment on whether it would follow suit on carry-on bags.

United will also prohibit these travelers from carrying on bags that can only fit in overhead bins, and they will not accrue miles toward elite status.The company expects the new moves will add $4.8 billion to its operating income per year by 2020, though the figure does not include rising wages. Fare initiatives like ""Basic Economy"" will account for $1 billion of this, as more customers pay to check bags or select higher fares that give them two free carry-ons.It was unclear if the move by United - No.3 in the United States by passenger traffic - would prompt similar bag limits from rivals. However, airlines have frequently copied each other in the past, like when they added fees for checked luggage. ""Customers have told us that they want more choice and Basic Economy delivers just that,"" said Julia Haywood, United's chief commercial officer, in a news release.The boarding process will also be faster because fewer customers will be searching for overhead bin space, United said.The announcement follows a move by Delta Air Lines Inc  to sell cheap tickets that prohibit itinerary changes and seat selection. Delta and United hope to lure customers with cheap fares and upsell them once they reveal the conditions of the ticket. It is a practice they are using to compete with low-cost carriers Spirit Airlines Inc and Frontier Airlines, which charge for add-ons including carry-on bags.Frontier was lowest for customer satisfaction in J.D.

282,"   By Jonathan Stempel and Jeffrey Dastin | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Monday said it has bought shares in the four biggest U.S. airlines: American Airlines Group Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc, Southwest Airlines Co and United Continental Holdings Inc.The investments mark an unexpected reversal for Berkshire, which has avoided the airline sector for nearly two decades after a troubled investment in the former US Air Group, a forerunner to American.They also expand Berkshire's bet on the U.S. economy, and in particular transportation. Berkshire already owns the BNSF railroad and the NetJets luxury plane unit, and in January paid $32.1 billion for aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts.According to a regulatory filing, Berkshire as of Sept. 30 owned 21.8 million American shares worth $797 million, 6.3 million Delta shares worth $249.3 million, and 4.5 million United shares worth $237.8 million.Buffett told CNBC television that Berkshire later invested in Southwest, and was disclosing that stake to avoid misleading investors into believing he was avoiding the carrier.It is unclear whether Buffett or one of his deputies, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, invested in the airlines.Shares often rise when investors perceive that Berkshire has given them its imprimatur.Buffett usually handles larger Berkshire investments such as Kraft Heinz Co, Wells Fargo & Co, Coca-Cola Co and International Business Machines Corp.His Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate also owns roughly 90 companies such as BNSF, Geico car insurance and Dairy Queen ice cream.The airline investments are ""really important for investor confidence"" in that sector, said Adam Hackel, an airline analyst at Imperial Capital LLC in New York. Berkshire did not respond to requests for comment.In after-hours trading, American shares rose 3.8 percent, Delta 3.4 percent, Southwest 3.3 percent and United 2.2 percent.U.S. airlines have benefited in recent years from lower fuel costs, labor peace, higher fees from checked bags and other once-free services, and reduced competition through mergers.Such factors helped the four largest U.S. carriers post a record $21.7 billion combined profit in 2015, and command more than two-thirds of the domestic market. WRIGHT BROTHERS, WRONG INVESTMENT Berkshire had ventured into airlines in 1989 when Buffett bought $358 million of USAir preferred stock, but he quickly regretted that investment.In 1997, he told Berkshire shareholders he had misjudged how USAir would ""increasingly feel the effects of an unregulated, fiercely-competitive market whereas its cost structure was a holdover from the days when regulation protected profits.""Eleven years later, Buffett felt no better, calling airlines a capital-intensive business that earned little or no money.""A durable competitive advantage has proven elusive ever since the days of the Wright Brothers,"" he wrote in his February 2008 shareholder letter. ""Indeed, if a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down."" Buffett nonetheless admitted to having sold the USAir stock, in 1998, at a ""hefty gain.""Orville Wright died in 1948, more than 44 years after he and his brother Wilbur flew their plane at Kitty Hawk, N.C.American and Delta said they welcomed Berkshire as an investor, and American said it ""reinforces our view that our industry has fundamentally changed in a profound and lasting way.""Southwest declined to comment. United had no immediate comment.Berkshire on Monday also disclosed other portfolio changes.It slashed its stake in Wal-Mart Stores Inc by roughly two-thirds to 13 million shares. Berkshire had begun paring its stake in the world's largest retailer earlier this year, after more than a decade of ownership.Separately, Berkshire reduced its stake in pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Inc, and exited an investment in Canadian oil and gas producer Suncor Energy Inc.

283,"   By Alana Wise | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Union mechanics at United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N) on Monday ratified a six-year joint collective bargaining agreement with the airline, marking the end to several years of contract talks between the two parties.The agreement, approved by United mechanics who are represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, is a major step toward integrating United and Continental, which merged in 2010, and reducing flight cancellations.Under the contract, 9,000 mechanics at United, the No. 3 U.S. airline by passenger traffic, will see pay hikes that will put their compensation packages ""2 percent above the highest compensation in the industry every two years.""""This contract represents the largest contract for a mechanics group in airline industry history,"" the director of the Teamsters airline division, David Bourne, said in a statement. ""It is a package worth a collective $1.7 billion in improvements in compensation and benefits over the current agreement."" United Airlines shares were down 1.5 percent at $68.26 by day's end in the New York Stock Exchange.United expects the mechanics’ contract and an additional payout to pilots to match a wage increase at rival Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) will add between 1.5 and 2 percentage points to its unit costs, excluding fuel and other expenses, in 2017, its Chief Financial Officer Andrew Levy said last month during an investor day presentation.In total, the company expects unit costs to rise between 3.5 percent and 4.5 percent in 2017 from a year earlier. United said on its last quarterly earnings call that cheap airfares and higher wages from new contracts would squeeze its results this fall, making it difficult to be as profitable as competitors.Nearly 52 percent of the 8,123 voting members supported the agreement, an upswing from the just 7 percent who voted in favor of a previous contract. Without a joint contract, United and Continental crews had been staffing separate flights since the merger. When a flight on a pre-merger United plane was short-staffed, pre-merger Continental employees could not be brought in, and vice versa, sometimes leading to cancellations.That is slated to change with Monday's news and a contract recently reached with the flight attendants.

284,"   By Alana Wise  United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N) forecasts a higher profit margin in the fourth quarter, as bookings strengthened and expenses related to employment benefits were lower than expected, the company said on Thursday.United, the No. 3 U.S. airline by passenger traffic, said it now expects its pretax margin to be between 7.5 percent and 8.5 percent, a jump from its earlier prediction of 5 percent to 7 percent for the period.Shares were unchanged in after-hours trading. The carrier announced a smaller-than-expected passenger unit revenue, which compares sales to how many seats United flies and how far it flies them. It is now projected to decline 3 percent to 4 percent compared with prior expectations of a 4 percent to 6 percent drop. The improved forecast comes on the heels of a newly ratified contract with the carrier's mechanics. United said it expects the deal to increase fourth-quarter unit costs, excluding fuel and other expenses, by 0.5 percentage points.However, United said lower benefits expenses would limit unit costs to growing between 4 percent and 4.5 percent in the quarter from a year ago.

285,"  American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O) said higher average fares per mile have boosted its revenue and profit expectations for the fourth quarter, a day after rival United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N) also raised forecasts.Shares of top U.S. airlines rose on Friday, with American's up 4 percent and United's up 4.2 percent.American, the world's largest airline, said on Friday it expects fourth-quarter unit revenue to range between a decline of 1 percent and an increase of 1 percent, compared with its previous forecast of a decline of 2.5 percent to 0.5 percent.Unit revenue compares sales to how many seats an airline flies and how far it flies them. The airline now expects pre-tax margin excluding items to be between 6 percent and 8 percent, up from its previous range of 5 percent to 7 percent.  United, the No. 3 U.S. airline by passenger traffic, also forecast on Thursday a higher profit margin in the fourth quarter as bookings strengthened and expenses related to employment benefits were lower than expected. ""United provided a solid upward guide to Q4 expectations last night, pushing consensus close the level where we initially began the quarter,"" JPMorgan analyst Jamie Baker said in a research note on Friday.  ""Meanwhile, American’s updated guide this morning, also implies upside to consensus estimates and critically also opens the door to positive unit revenues in Q4.""
