0,"  * Wholesale gasoline prices jump in US Midwest* Marathon, Valero, Exxon, PBF confront cold* Many problems seen short-livedHOUSTON, Jan 7 Frigid weather rattled several U.S. refiners on Tuesday, temporarily affecting production from Canada to Tennessee, and boosting wholesale gasoline prices in the Midwest more than 7 cents a gallon.Marathon Petroleum Corp. said its 120,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) Detroit refinery lost instrument air due to freezing temperatures, while Valero Energy Corp.  reported its 180,000 bpd Memphis refinery had a ""system shutdown believed to be due to low temperatures in the area,"" according to a filing with state and federal regulators.Those notices came one day after an equipment shutdown due to cold weather at Exxon Mobil Corp's 238,000 bpd Joliet, Illinois refinery. Exxon said the refinery was back to normal operations on Tuesday. The company did not describe the malfunction but said it resulted in releases through its flare stacks.Gasoline for Midwest markets outside of Chicago climbed 7.5 cents a gallon on Tuesday to a discount of 15 cents a gallon to  the February RBOB gasoline contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange, traders said.Gasoline for delivery to the Chicago market rose 5.35 cents  to an offer price of 12 cents a gallon under February RBOB, traders said. Citgo Petroleum Corp said its 174,500 bpd Lemont, Illinois refinery was ""running at planned rates"" while ""working its way through minor issues caused by low ambient temperatures.""Cold weather can pose significant challenges to refiners. Some refinery units operate at nearly 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit (540 degrees Celcius). Oil and other feedstocks running through plant pipelines are heated to 300 or 400 degrees. Sudden deep drops in temperature can cause liquids to freeze - leading to breakdowns or piping ruptures.And there can be problems like that cited by Marathon at its Detroit plant. Instrument air links to sensors used to monitor the status of equipment at refineries. Without instrumentation, most refinery units go to flaring to prevent a problem until the sensors can be fixed. Energy industry intelligence company Genscape reported on Tuesday that a gasoline-making fluid catalytic cracking unit was shut down late Monday at Marathon's Detroit refinery.The outages at Marathon and Exxon appeared to be short-lived. Marathon said it was beginning the process of restarting the affected units.Other refineries were not so lucky.In Canada, North Atlantic Refining Ltd's Come by Chance refinery in Newfoundland was still offline following power cuts in the region that started on Thursday, before a blizzard hit the area and two days before a fire at a power substation, local media reported. Flaring, emissions and power trouble were reported at several other U.S. refineries on Tuesday, though weather was not immediately cited as a contributing factor.Flaring reportedly occurred at Marathon's 212,000 bpd Catlettsburg Refinery in Kentucky and PBF Energy Inc's  182,200 bpd refinery in Delaware City, Delaware.Traders said PBF's 160,000 bpd refinery in Paulsboro, New Jersey, was shut by a power outage.Just as cold weather was spreading across the United States, Monroe Energy LLC, a unit of Delta Air Lines Inc, started planned maintenance on a crude unit and isocracker at its 185,000 barrel per day (bpd) refinery in Trainer, Pennsylvania.IIR, an energy market intelligence provider, reported that some units at the plant were shut on Friday and would be shut for 30 days, though a company spokesman on Monday could not specify when the work started.Genscape reported brief, elevated flaring on Friday at the refinery.",2014-01-07,VLO,"Tue Jan 7, 2014 | 5:35pm EST",UPDATE 2-Frigid temperatures snarl some U.S. refinery operations,http://www.reuters.com//article/refinery-operations-weather-idUSL2N0KH1CJ20140107?type=companyNews
1,"   By Selam Gebrekidan and Valerie Volcovici | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Jan 7 Top U.S. oil refiner Valero Energy voiced the first major opposition to ending a decades-old ban on crude oil exports on Tuesday, adding to a debate that will likely shape the biggest energy issue of the year.""It makes more sense to keep crude oil here in the U.S.,"" Bill Day, a spokesman for the San Antonio, Texas-based company, said.He added the current system, which requires a presidential waiver for most oil exports but allows companies to apply for licenses to sell oil to Canada, is ""working well."" Valero has received permits to ship crude to its Quebec refinery. ""It has significantly reduced American dependence on foreign oil, kept U.S. refining utilization high, and insulated American consumers from geopolitical shocks,"" Day said.Rising oil production in the United States, now at a 25-year high, has cut domestic crude oil prices, a boon for refiners like Valero who process the cheap crude into gasoline, diesel and other fuels that fetch better value. Those fuels can be freely exported to the global market. If the ban on oil exports is lifted, refiners will take a hit on their profit margins as they pay more for the oil they process. Oil producers like Exxon Mobil, who support lifting the ban, on the other hand, will have the opportunity to sell their crude to the highest bidder anywhere in the world. Day's comments came after Senator Lisa Murkowski, the top Republican on the Senate Energy Committee, unveiled a report that urged lawmakers to review the ban.""My interest is not to protect the refineries' bottom line,"" Murkowski said on Tuesday. ""They are going to have to deal with it within the industry.""Rival independent refiner Marathon Petroleum Corp  does not oppose lifting the crude-oil export ban, although it said the country will have more to gain by exporting refined products to Latin America and Europe.",2014-01-07,VLO,"Tue Jan 7, 2014 | 12:22pm EST",Valero speaks out against lifting ban on U.S. crude oil exports,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-energy-exports-idUSL2N0KH15V20140107?type=companyNews

3,"  By Kristen Hays and Anna DriverHOUSTON Jan 29 Marathon Petroleum Corp, Valero Energy Corp and Phillips 66, the three largest U.S. independent refiners, reported quarterly results on Wednesday that topped Wall Street estimates as cheaper crude prices and rising exports helped profits.Sour crudes from Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Texas and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico contributed to the lower prices, along with the opening of more pipeline capacity throughout 2013 that increased flows of cheaper inland U.S. crudes to Gulf Coast refineries - replacing some types of more expensive imports.New infrastructure - built in large part to handle surging output of unconventional North American crudes from shale deposits and Canada's oil sands - has benefited plants on the Gulf Coast, home to more than 40 percent of U.S. refining capacity.Many of those refineries have ramped up exports of fuels to Europe and Latin America, where demand is surging because of a lack of local refining capacity.Marathon more than doubled its refined product exports to 298,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter from year-ago levels, and aims to increase that capacity to 400,000 bpd. Phillips 66's exports reached 197,000 bpd, a 32 percent rise on the year and toward its goal of 500,000 bpd of export capacity.U.S. officials said exports of refined products hit a record 3.66 million bpd last week.""Gulf Coast refiners are the best positioned to benefit from price-advantaged North American crudes and the global refined product market,"" Roger Read, a refining analyst at Wells Fargo, told clients on Wednesday.Marathon shares gained 4 percent to $86.52, Valero added 2.4 percent to $51.40, while Phillips 66 shares closed down 1.2 percent to $74.18. DEBATE OVER CRUDE EXPORT BAN With output of domestic U.S. crudes surging and available refinery capacity limited, some oil producers have urged Congress to lift a ban on nearly all crude oil exports that was imposed in the 1970s.Valero has come out firmly against scrapping the rule, apparently because it could mean higher domestic crude prices.Marathon Petroleum Chief Executive Gary Heminger told analysts the company was not opposed to U.S. crude exports, but that the debate over whether to lift the prohibition could ""take a long time"" in Washington.With some political analysts saying voters who remember long gas lines from the 1970s will balk at lifting the ban, some refiners are investing in infrastructure to boost exports. Phillips 66 Chief Executive Greg Garland said the company is considering building a condensate splitter at the same marine terminal in Freeport, Texas, where a liquefied petroleum gas export terminal is under construction.Condensates are very light hydrocarbons defined as crude under U.S. law, and cannot be exported without being processed.Garland had previously said Phillips 66 didn't envision building a splitter, but the company's recently-launched midstream partnership provided a natural home for that infrastructure. He also said it would be an export terminal.""When you look at the economic value created, it encourages you to do these things,"" Garland told Reuters in an interview.Heminger hinted that Marathon, which is building condensate splitters at its Ohio and Kentucky refineries to process Utica shale condensate, is considering a similar project on the Gulf Coast, though he wasn't explicit. He said the light hydrocarbon also can be part of refineries' crude slates and shipped to Canada to dilute heavy Canadian oil so it can move in pipelines. ""We are looking more at the opportunities we have to be able to bring that condensate into our system along with the Utica condensate that we've already announced,"" he said.MORE PIPELINE CAPACITY Additional pipeline infrastructure last year eased Gulf Coast crude prices, cutting costs for refiners.Gulf Coast crude benchmark Light Louisiana Sweet, which had traded at an average $1-a-barrel premium to international Brent  for most of last year, fell abruptly to a steep discount in the fourth quarter - further discouraging imports.Valero Energy's fourth quarter profit was lifted by a $325 million gain on the sale of its interest in retail business CST Brands Inc. Excluding items, the San Antonio company had a profit of $1.78 per share. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.66 per share.It said its 235,000-barrel-per-day Quebec City, Quebec, refinery was expected to run 100 percent North American crude oil by the end of 2014. Valero has been boosting the refinery's capacity to receive crude oil from the United States by rail.Marathon, which operates large plants in Garyville, Louisiana and Texas City, Texas, also had a profit that surpassed expectations, but maintenance costs contributed to a lower quarterly profit.For the fourth quarter, Marathon reported net income of $626 million, or $2.07 per share, down from $755 million, or $2.24 per share, in the year-ago period. Excluding items, Marathon earned $2.10 per share, a figure that handily beat analysts average estimate of $1.15 per share.Phillips 66 had a quarterly profit of $826 million, or $1.37 per share, compared with $708 million, or $1.11 per share in the same quarter a year earlier. Adjusting for certain items, Phillips 66 had a per share profit of $1.34.

4,"   By Kristen Hays and Anna Driver | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Jan 29 Marathon Petroleum Corp, Valero Energy Corp and Phillips 66, the three largest U.S. independent refiners, reported quarterly results on Wednesday that topped Wall Street estimates as cheaper crude prices on the Gulf Coast helped profits.Startups of multiple pipelines in Texas throughout 2013 increasingly brought cheaper inland U.S. crudes to Gulf Coast refineries, replacing more expensive imports and alleviating bottlenecks in the Midwest.Seaway is one such project, involving the reversal of an existing pipeline to deliver 400,000 barrels per day from the Cushing oil storage hub to the Gulf Coast. The pipeline, owned by Enterprise Product Partners and Canada's Enbridge Inc  began operations in May 2012, was expanded in January 2013 with a new twin line with capacity of 450,000 bpd planned to start up in the second quarter.Seaway was the only major artery from the bloated U.S. crude futures hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, to the Gulf Coast, until last week when TransCanada Corp opened its 700,000 bpd Gulf Coast pipeline - the southern leg of the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. The new infrastructure - built in large part to handle surging output of unconventional North American crudes - has benefited plants on the Gulf Coast, which has more than 40 percent of U.S. refining capacity.Many of those refineries have ramped up exports of fuels to Latin America and Europe.

Gulf Coast crude benchmark Light Louisiana Sweet, which had traded at an average $1-a-barrel premium to international Brent for most of last year, fell abruptly to a steep discount in the fourth quarter - further discouraging imports.The cost benefit was similar to the advantage held by Midwest refiners in recent years, as the Cushing glut pushed West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude prices to sharp discounts to Brent and other global crudes.

14,"  * Inland U.S. crudes getting lighter, prompting some refinery rate cuts* First-quarter profit up 27 pct* Shares down 1.4 percent* Analysts optimistic about Q2   (Adds comment from analysts and conference call)By Kristen Hays and Anna DriverApril 29 Valero Energy Corp, the largest U.S. independent refiner, said cheap inland U.S. crude oil boosted its first-quarter profits and also prompted rate cuts at a pair of plants that can only run so much of it.Valero and other refiners' profit margins have been fattened by ample supplies of oil produced from U.S. shale formations. Those market conditions have continued into the second quarter and are likely to boost earnings as companies make investments and adjustments to their plants to process more of the crude.""We see a trend toward the crude getting lighter and it has caused some operating issues for us, some constraints where we have to cut rates,"" Gary Simmons, corporate vice president of crude, feedstock, supply and trading, told analysts on Tuesday during the company's quarterly earnings call.Booming inland U.S. crude output is largely light sweet, which can prompt refiners to cut rates if plants are not re-configured to run more than they have traditionally run.Valero is building special ""crude topper"" units at its Houston and Corpus Christi refineries to increase light-sweet crude processing capabilities, and has added a similar unit to its Three Rivers refinery to do the same. Other refiners along the U.S. Gulf Coast, with plants configured to run heavier crudes like those produced in Canada or Venezuela, are making similar adjustments, including Flint Hills Resources and Delek U.S. Holdings.Without such adjustments, refiners with too much light sweet crude coming in can face constraints like distillation units unable to handle more vapors or hydraulic capacity limits.Simmons said such constraints had prompted Valero to cut rates at its refineries in northwest Texas and Oklahoma with a combined capacity of 241,000 barrels per day.""We try to control that the best we can by working with producers to control the quality of the barrels that we're getting,"" Simmons said. BETTER THAN EXPECTED RESULTS Valero reported a better-than-expected first-quarter profit as cheaper crude fattened margins.U.S. Gulf Coast refiners' margins are benefiting as new pipelines bring in cheap inland U.S. shale oil and other grades of crude like Mexico's Mayan are trading at strong discounts.""Q2 is off to a strong start for the key drivers of Valero's  earnings,"" analysts at Credit Suisse said in a note to clients on Tuesday. ""Although narrower than the first quarter Maya remains cheap vs. Brent, and product margins are stronger quarter over quarter, particularly.""Valero said it also expected to benefit from increased fuel demand as the economy recovers. ""U.S. gasoline demand and margins look positive as we enter the summer driving season,"" Chief Executive Bill Klesse said in a statement. Klesse is stepping down as CEO this week and will remain chairman while Chief Operating Officer Joe Gorder takes the helm as CEO.Valero said it was looking at growing access to cheap North American crude oil. The company said on Tuesday that its rail unloading facility at Port Arthur, Texas was expected to be completed in the fourth quarter.At its plant in Quebec City, 45 percent of the crude it processes is now cheaper North American oil, a figure that is expected to rise to 100 percent by the end of the year after a pipeline reversal.Operating income in the refining business rose 8 percent to $1.3 billion in the first quarter, from a year earlier.Ethanol operating income ballooned to $243 million from $14 million due to weather-related supply disruptions, lower industry ethanol inventories, import volumes and corn costs.Net income rose to $828 million, or $1.54 per share, in the  quarter ended March 31, from $654 million, or $1.18 per share, a year earlier.The average analyst estimate was for a profit of $1.38, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Lower taxes helped Valero's earnings top Wall Street expectations, analysts said.Valero's shares were down 85 cents at $57.12 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading.

21,"  July 14 U.S. refining company Valero Energy Corp  on Monday said second-quarter income will be higher than a year ago but profit will fall short of Wall Street estimates on seasonal weakness in its biggest Gulf Coast market.Doug Terreson, analyst at ISI Group, said the company's capture rate in the Gulf Coast typically weakens in the second quarter. Capture rates represent a refining company's ability to profit from current market conditions. Valero expects income from continuing operations of $1.10 to $1.25 per share for the second quarter of 2014. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.39 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Valero also expects to report a loss from discontinued operations of $63 million, or 12 cents per share, related primarily to a non-cash charge associated with the closure of its Aruba refinery.

25,"   By Michael Hirtzer  Aug 1 Valero Energy Corp is buying corn ahead of the expected startup within the next month of the company's 110-million-gallon a year ethanol plant in Mount Vernon, Indiana, U.S. cash grains sources said on Friday.The plant is the largest corn-based ethanol plant not currently operating in the U.S. and will add capacity to an industry that produced a record amount of the biofuel earlier this summer.""They are starting to take corn already and hope to be grinding by early September,"" a cash grain trader in southern Indiana said. Valero spokesman Bill Day declined to comment on exact timing for the plant's restart. ""We expect to have the Mount Vernon plant in operation and making ethanol sometime this quarter, but I don't have a specific date,"" he said in an email.The quarter ends on Sept. 30. The company, the largest U.S. independent oil refiner which bought the ethanol plant earlier this year from privately held Aventine Renewable Energy Holdings Inc, nearly doubled its profits from ethanol production in second-quarter earnings that matched Wall Street expectations.The facility in southern Indiana, located along the lower Ohio River, has been shut down for about two years and will compete to buy corn with a nearby ethanol plant operated by Abengoa Bioenergy Corp. Ethanol makers that reduced operations amid high corn prices last year were now running near-capacity as the lowest grain prices since 2010 resulted in big profit margins.Valero has 10 other ethanol facilities - another plant in Indiana as well as plants in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin. Valero is the No. 3 U.S. ethanol producer, behind Archer Daniels Midland Co and POET LLC.(Reporting by Michael Hirtzer; Editing by Bernard Orr)",2014-08-01,VLO,"Fri Aug 1, 2014 | 3:05pm EDT",Valero buying corn to restart Indiana ethanol plant -trade,http://www.reuters.com//article/valero-energy-ethanol-idUSL2N0Q722O20140801?type=companyNews
26,"  (Adds details on construction, Plains blending)By Kristen HaysHOUSTON Aug 21 Plains All American Pipeline LP  will build a crude oil pipeline from its terminal at the U.S. futures hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, to Valero Energy Corp's  Tennessee refinery, helping the largest U.S. refiner cut transportation costs to tap cheap inland oil.Plains said on Thursday it will build the 440-mile (708 km), 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) Diamond Pipeline to the 180,000 bpd refinery, which is configured to process light crudes. The $900 million project is expected to be completed in late 2016, Plains said, adding startup would come after that. The two companies have been evaluating the project for several months as Valero considered ways to cut its crude procurement costs.The refinery typically runs Light Louisiana Sweet WTC-LLS, but last year received up to 100,000 bpd of North Dakota Bakken crude that was moved via rail to Louisiana, then transported to the refinery via the Capline pipeline, operated by Marathon Petroleum Corp. Those Bakken volumes have declined as more of the North Dakota crude flows to the U.S. East and West Coasts via rail, Dan Collier, vice president of commercial optimization for Valero, said at a recent energy conference in Houston. He declined, however, to disclose current volumes. The Diamond pipeline will connect Valero's Memphis refinery with domestic sweet crude from Plains' terminal that receives crude from various U.S. oilfields, cutting transportation costs and the distance covered to receive Bakken crude via rail and the Capline. Plains is a major blender of crudes at its Cushing facility.Valero agreed to a long-term shipping contract with Plains as well as related storage and terminal services.Valero also holds an option until January 2016 to buy a half interest in the Diamond Pipeline.

The two companies have been evaluating the project for several months as Valero considered ways to cut crude procurement costs.The refinery typically runs Light Louisiana Sweet WTC-LLS, but last year received up to 100,000 bpd of North Dakota Bakken crude that was moved via rail to Louisiana, then transported to the refinery in the Marathon Petroleum Corp -operated Capline pipeline. Those Bakken volumes have declined as more of the North Dakota crude flows to the East and West coasts via rail, Dan Collier, vice president of commercial optimization for Valero, said at a recent energy conference in Houston. He declined to disclose current volumes.The Diamond pipeline will connect Valero's Memphis refinery with domestic sweet crude from Plains' terminal that receives crude from various U.S. oilfields, cutting transportation costs and the distance covered to receive Bakken crude via rail and the Capline. Valero agreed to a long-term shipping contract with Plains as well as related storage and terminal services.Valero also holds an option until January 2016 to buy a half interest in the Diamond Pipeline.(Reporting By Kristen Hays; Editing by Chris Reese)",2014-08-21,VLO,"Thu Aug 21, 2014 | 11:53am EDT",Plains to build Cushing-to-Memphis pipeline for Valero,http://www.reuters.com//article/plains-all-amer-valero-energy-pipeline-idUSL2N0QR18620140821?type=companyNews
28,"   By Erwin Seba | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Valero Energy Corp is permanently shuttering the 38,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracking unit at its 125,000-bpd Meraux, Louisiana, refinery by mid-October, more than a year ahead of a regulator’s deadline, sources familiar with operations at the plant said on Tuesday.A Valero spokesman declined to discuss operations at the refinery.The FCCU and an alkylation unit that produces 7,300 bpd in octane-boosting additives for gasoline are expected to be mothballed by mid-October when a refinery overhaul that began in late July ends, the sources said.Valero had agreed with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to permanently shut the FCCU by the end of 2015 to bring the refinery east of New Orleans into compliance with environmental rules.Valero Chairman Bill Klesse said in March that the Meraux refinery FCC might be shut ahead of the deadline.""We are converting the Meraux refinery to a full (hydrocracking unit) refinery,"" Klesse said. ""We have to shut the FCC at the end of 2015. It may go down earlier."" Valero planned to keep the FCCU in operation as long as it was profitable, Klesse said in March.The sources said Valero decided during the overhaul, which was originally projected to wrap up next week, to shut the FCCU as opposed to fixing it to keep it in operation into next year.""They didn't want to spend any more money to fix it up when they’ll just have to shut it down,"" one of the sources said.Valero is adding 20,000 bpd in hydrocracking capacity to the 35,000 bpd currently at the Meraux refinery. A hydrocracker places gasoil produced by a crude unit under high pressure and heat in the presence of hydrogen to make gasoline and diesel. It can be configured to produce more diesel than gasoline. Valero plans to configure the hydrocracker to produce 85 percent diesel up from the current 35 percent. Diesel has become a lucrative export for U.S. Gulf Coast refiners.An FCCU uses a very fine powder known as catalyst to convert gasoil into unfinished gasoline. Fluidic refers to the catalyst, which acts like a fluid in the unit. Hydrocrackers are best configured for refineries that utilize heavy, sour crude oil like that imported from Mexico and Venezuela. Valero is not the only refiner to consider idling a gasoline producing unit. Marathon Petroleum Corp is considering closing a 60,000-bpd FCCU at its 451,000-bpd Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, Texas, sources have told ReutersValero's 205,000 bpd St. Charles refinery in Norco, Louisiana, located 35 miles (56 km) west of the Meraux refinery, has an FCCU with a daily production capacity of 100,000 barrels.Similarly, Marathon's Galveston Bay refinery also has a 120,000 bpd FCCU.Valero has also increased the hydrocracking capacity at its Port Arthur, Texas, and St. Charles refineries.

31,"   By Jessica Resnick-Ault and Mike Stone | NEW YORK  NEW YORK At least three oil companies are still actively bidding for Citgo Petroleum Corp, the U.S. refining arm of Venezuela's PDVSA, even after the country's finance minister said that the auction was no longer going ahead, according to three people familiar with the situation.The investment bank hired by PDVSA to conduct the sale, Lazard Ltd, has not ended the sale process, the people said on Tuesday, and a deadline for a second round of bids is expected later this month. The people declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Any deal for Citgo, which could be worth as much as $10 billion, could help to reshape the U.S. refining landscape, giving the winning bidder access to major refining assets in the Midwest and on the Gulf Coast at a time when U.S. oil production is soaring. The Citgo refineries are in a position to access supplies of crude from U.S. Shale formations and imported Canadian crude. For Venezuela, a sale would provide much needed capital to meet its budget needs.A Citgo representative did not immediately provide comment. Officials at PDVSA and Venezuela’s oil ministry could not be immediately reached for comment. A Lazard representative declined to comment.Finance Minister Rodolfo Marco said in an interview published in Venezuelan media on Oct. 26 that the sale of Citgo Petroleum “has been ruled out” and the nation’s President Nicolas Maduro had “affirmed” the decision.  It was not immediately clear why Lazard was going ahead with the auction despite that declaration, and whether the process could eventually be called off.Marco’s announcement surprised bidders who had done due diligence on the Citgo assets. A first round of bids attracted contenders including Marathon Petroleum Corp, Valero Energy Corp, India’s Reliance Industries Ltd, PBF Energy Inc and HollyFrontier Corp.  It was not immediately clear who would be bidding in the second round. Valero and Marathon declined to comment on the bidding process. PBF,  HollyFrontier and Reliance did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Since Venezuela began the auction this summer, the price of oil has plunged from about $105 per barrel to $77 per barrel, putting huge pressure on the government’s budget, which relies a lot on revenue from oil sales.  Plans to sell Citgo have been controversial within the Venezuelan government. Top officials in the cash-strapped country appeared to support the divestment to help shore up its finances while others in the leftist coalition slammed moves to sell Citgo as a covert privatization.

37,"  U.S. refiners Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N) and Phillips 66 (PSX.N) reported better-than-expected quarterly profits as they processed more cheap crude oil amid buoyant demand for gasoline.Global oil prices CLc1 LCOc1 have tumbled almost 60 percent since June, pulling down prices at the pump. U.S. gasoline demand rose 8 percent to 8.89 million barrels per day (bpd) over the past four weeks, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday.Phillips 66 said it processed a record 375,000 bpd of tight oil, nearly 12 percent more than its previous high.Valero processed an average of 2.8 million barrels per day in the fourth quarter, up 41,000 bpd from a year earlier.Phillips 66 said total costs and expenses fell nearly 20 percent. Valero's costs fell nearly 21 percent.Refiners have been enjoying plump profits as growing output from U.S. shale oil and Canadian oil sands has put downward pressure on crude prices. Still, refining earnings or operating income at both companies fell from the third quarter of 2014, when U.S. gasoline prices had not yet fallen to less than $2 per gallon in much of the country. San Antonio-based Valero said net income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders fell to $1.22 billion, or $2.22 per share, for the quarter ended Dec. 31 from $1.29 billion, or $2.38 per share, a year earlier.

40,"  TORONTO, March 10 The two oil trains that derailed and burst into flames in recent weeks in northern Ontario were both carrying synthetic crude to Valero Energy Corp's refinery near Quebec City, the U.S.-based company said on Tuesday.Saturday's CN Rail derailment came less than a month after another CN train carrying oil went off the tracks and ignited in northern Ontario. The railway had said both were carrying crude from Alberta, but declined to give their exact destination.""We take safety very seriously, so we're concerned anytime there's an incident,"" said Valero spokesman Bill Day. ""Despite the number of rail incidents recently, it is very rare for cargo not to be delivered to its destination safely.""Day said all of the rail companies Valero works with, including CN Rail, have good safety records. Synthetic crude is produced from Alberta's oil sands in upgrader plants, and usually commands a premium to conventional crudes because it is lighter and easier to refine into valuable byproducts such as gasoline.Valero's Jean Gaulin refinery is in Levis, across the St. Lawrence River from Quebec City. In May 2013, the company said it would build a rail off-loading facility at the Jean Gaulin refinery so it could start using Western Canadian crude rather than relying on pricier imports. The company told Reuters it would take light, sweet Western Canadian crude rather than heavier oil sands crude.Shipments of North American crude to the refinery ramped up early last year. On a July earnings call, the company said North American grades made up 83 percent of the refinery's feedstock in the second quarter of 2014, up from 45 percent in the first quarter and 8 percent higher than a year earlier. Separately on Tuesday, CN spokesman Jim Feeny said the train that derailed in February had been carrying petroleum distillates in addition to synthetic crude.""The contents of the tank cars are a subject of interest and the TSB will be testing the contents to determine what they were,"" said John Cottreau, spokesman for Canada's Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the incidents.In a note to shippers on Tuesday, CN said a temporary bypass track would likely be completed by late afternoon, reopening its main line in northern Ontario.

42,"   By Jim Forsyth | SAN ANTONIO  SAN ANTONIO Valero Energy Corp is taking advantage of low oil prices to aggressively build out its refining and logistical assets, but new acquisitions are not planned, Chief Executive Joe Gorder said at the company's annual shareholders meeting on Thursday.""There is nothing currently pending,"" Gorder said of potential acquisitions. ""I don't think there are any refining assets that are in the market that we would take a look at.""There were no great logistics assets up for grabs.""Periodically, we have logistics assets coming into the market, but there is nothing that is hot right now,"" he said.Valero, the largest U.S. refiner, currently has a utilization rate of 96 percent. Gorder said the company's major focus is increasing capacity at plants it already owns. That includes two new crude topping units at plants in Corpus Christi and Houston with a combined 160,000 bpd in light crude processing capacity. Both will allow Valero to cut costs by producing more of its own feedstocks instead of buying them, and should start up in early 2016.""They are not intended to drive increased production volumes, but they are more intended to optimize the system that we have in place,"" Gorder said.Valero is also investing in logistics, from storage tanks to pipelines. Valero could potentially use its Gulf Coast terminals to send crude oil to Mexico under swaps subject to approval by Washington. Mexico's state oil company has proposed a swap, although the U.S. Commerce Department has yet to okay it.""The relationship with the Mexicans that has been talked about is a swap,"" he said.""We would take their heavy sour crude, which they don't have the ability to process as well as we do in the Gulf Coast, and we would send them light sweet crude, which they have a greater need for. Valero is well positioned to do that."" Its Gulf Coast terminals currently export crude oil to Canada, where Valero has a plant. Canada is the only country that can receive imports of U.S. crude under current law.He told shareholders Valero has seen crude oil prices stabilizing following the 50 percent slide that started in June.""We are seeing stabilization of production here domestically,"" he said. ""As we see prices rise back to this $60 level and perhaps moving up from there, we should see increased drilling activity again."" (Editing by Terry Wade.

45,"  * Delayed restart of Exxon refinery draws down inventories* Valero and BP among traders shipping jet from Asia to U.S.* Asian jet fuel margin climbs to 1-week highBy Jessica JaganathanSINGAPORE, May 13 Asian jet fuel shipments to the United States West Coast region could pick up this month as a prolonged cut in throughput at a California refinery is drawing down inventories, traders said on Wednesday.Arbitrage economics to ship jet fuel from North Asia to the U.S. West Coast are now profitable, so there would be an increase in spot jet fuel cargoes on that route over the coming weeks, they said.Demand from the U.S. helped push up Asian jet fuel margins to a one-week high on Wednesday. An explosion in February that shut the gasoline-making unit of Exxon Mobil's Torrance 149,500 barrels-per-day (bpd)  refinery near Los Angeles reduced throughput at the refinery.This has pushed up gasoline prices which is prompting refineries in the U.S. west coast to produce more gasoline than jet fuel, in turn drawing down inventories for the latter and increasing import demand, one of them said.""The U.S. west coast prompt month market is strong and has been since middle of last week...I think the ExxonMobil incident and a delayed restart is causing it,"" a Singapore-based trader who is familiar with shipments on that route said. The distillate stocks, which include jet fuel, in the U.S. west coast slipped by nearly 4 percent to 13.901 million barrels in the week to May 1, latest data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed.Valero has tentatively fixed the ""Qi Lin Zuo"" to ship 60,000 tonnes of jet fuel from South Korea to the U.S. west coast for loading in late May, traders and shipbrokers said.Marubeni has tentatively fixed the High Progress to ship 40,000 tonnes of jet fuel from either South Korea or Bristol Bay headed to the U.S. west coast, though this could not be confirmed. At least two other cargoes are also due to be shipped from South Korea and Taiwan, including one by BP, they added.When the arbitrage economics are not profitable, typically only 1 or 2 vessels are shipped on that route, traders said.Shipments could slow once the firm demand starts driving up jet fuel prices in Asia, a Singapore-based jet fuel trader said.""(Arbitrage economics) are well workable if you have cargo on the water, so it's more for the prompt dates,"" he said.""If you buy the oil now and ship to the U.S. , by the time the cargo arrives in the U.S., the arbitrage might shut.""Still, with demand for jet fuel weak in Asia and supply ample with refineries largely back from maintenance, it might be a matter of which trade flow loses the least money, a second trader said.

46,"  HOUSTON Valero Energy Corp was preparing to restart production units at its 180,000 barrel per day (bpd) Memphis, Tennessee, refinery, which was hit by a power interruption on Sunday, sources familiar with plant operations said. The refinery plans to restart the smaller of two crude distillation units on Monday night and proceed with bringing the other production units into production on Tuesday, the sources said.A Valero spokesman said he did not have information available about the status of operations at the refinery. The refinery was one of 12,000 customers in the Memphis area that lost power on Sunday due to a malfunction at a third-party power provider.

47,"  (Repeats without change)By Chris PrenticeNEW YORK, July 14 Valero Energy Corp, one of the biggest U.S. oil refiners, is preparing to sell ethanol for export for the first time, the company said, betting on the $2 billion overseas market as U.S. demand remains plagued by political uncertainty.The San Antonio-based oil refiner, the third-largest U.S. ethanol producer, has recently been offering export-grade ethanol to shippers and leasing tank space for it at St. Rose, Louisiana, opening a gateway to major markets in Asia and Brazil, three U.S. trade sources said.For now, the material will be sold on a freight-on-board basis for shipment overseas, they said.Ultimately, the company plans to sell its output and third-party production directly to buyers overseas, as it does with other fuel products. ""We are looking at increasing sales and expanding markets, including export markets,"" said Valero spokesman Bill Day.He declined to confirm details of the plan or comment on them.The move underscores the increasingly competitive nature of the overseas market as U.S. biofuels policy remains in flux and companies rush to sell in countries such as Brazil and the Philippines, where government mandates have helped drive demand. The push abroad will pit Valero against Archer Daniels Midland Co, the country's top producer, privately-held Marquis Energy LLC, and Pacific Ethanol, which are also going after a slice of the export market.Ethanol is also battling for market share with rival gasoline additives, like methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), which are used to oxygenate fuel and are popular in the Middle East and other regions. Exports offer hope for the U.S. industry after the government proposed lower-than-expected targets for blending biofuel into the nation's motor fuel.U.S. prices are down 20 percent over the past year and inventories are near three-year highs. Even as new capacity comes online, Brazilian producers are shipping cargoes to the United States as the import window widens.In the first five months of the year, the United States exported 377 million gallons of ethanol, up 6 percent from the same period last year, government data show.Since it started ethanol production six years ago, Valero has only sold a domestic grade, traders said, but the company spokesman said it was eyeing a bigger export presence when it bought and revived a 110-million-gallon plant in Mount Vernon, Indiana, last year from Aventine Renewable Energy Holdings.That plant, its 11th ethanol facility, gave it access to the Ohio River.

Recent weekly U.S. government data showed finished motor gasoline demand at its highest level since records were available in 1991.The strong demand has prompted refiners to produce higher-than-normal volumes of gasoline. They have also enjoyed bumper margins while crude has remained cheap.Refiners such as Valero, Marathon Petroleum Corp and CVR Refining said they expect demand to remain strong for the rest of the summer, even extending into the fall and winter months if the pump prices remain low and the economy continues to grow. ""We're certainly running our gas-producing units at max utilization,"" Valero CEO Joe Gorder said during an earnings call on Thursday. ""We're having trouble keeping up with gasoline inventory. So I think it will be here for an extended period.""The company said that it had to curtail its gasoline exports in the second quarter to meet domestic demand. U.S. motorists logged 275 billion vehicle miles in May, the highest in a single month since 1990, according to the latest data from the U.S. Department of Transportation.  The May figures followed consecutive months of surprisingly traffic volumes.Marathon CEO Gary Heminger said the increased traffic has pushed production volumes to 2007 levels. Heminger also noted that gasoline and diesel exports are also enticing refiners to run at high rates. ""We have continued to see very strong and very robust demand on diesel into Latin America, Europe and South America, with continued increases in the request for gasoline cargos,I find both export products being very strong going into the third quarter ... I think that underpins the strength of refining going forward.The cold weather will predictably stifle some driving, hurting demand, the refiners said, but the drop-off might not be as steep as previous years.""We would see the seasonality as we get out of driving season, and we would certainly expect some fall off in gasoline demand,"" Gary Simmons, Valero Senior Vice President, said. ""As long as we see the lower prices, I think we expect the demand response to continue to be good.""

55,"  (Updates to include corporate history, paragraphs 3-8)Sept 9 Valero Energy Corp, the leading U.S. refiner, may soon return to its roots as a buyer of refineries, Chief Executive Officer Joe Gorder said on Wednesday.""We think there are acquisition opportunities going forward,"" Gorder said during a webcast presentation at the Barclays Energy Conference in New York.A Valero CEO has not expressed as broad a commitment to acquiring new refineries since 2005, when company founder Bill Greehey stepped down. Greehey grew the company through purchases of refining companies and single-plant buys primarily in the early years of this century.Under former Chief Executive Bill Klesse, who succeeded Greehey, Valero focused on growth through improvement of existing plants, saying acquisitions would be done only through a disciplined process following set criteria.The company sold two refineries in the U.S. Northeast in 2010 and in 2011 purchased the Pembroke refinery in Wales from Chevron Corp and a Meraux, Louisiana, refinery from Murphy Oil. Gorder took over from Klesse in 2014. As late as April of this year, Gorder told Reuters that Valero would grow its existing assets and was not looking to buy plants.""There is nothing currently pending,"" Gorder said after the company's annual shareholders meeting. ""I don't think there are any refining assets that are in the market that we would take a look at."" But Gorder said on Wednesday that Valero already had refineries and logistics assets in its sights""This is something you're doing all the time,"" he said. ""We have a list of targets we're looking at internally.""Gorder declined to say where the San Antonio-based company was shopping for possible purchases. Some targets could be corporate acquisitions, while others could be single facilities, he added.Compared with refineries, however, Gorder said he expected a higher growth rate in the logistics sector, where Valero, like its competitors, operates a master limited partnership focused on crude oil and refined products pipelines and terminals.Valero operates 13 refineries in North America with a combined crude oil processing capacity of 1.96 million barrels per day, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.Valero also owns the Pembroke refinery and 11 U.S. ethanol plants and controls the Valero Energy Partners master limited partnership.

56,"  (Repeats with no changes to text)By Tim McLaughlinBOSTON, Sept 30 One-in-four U.S. large-cap mutual funds have increased their stakes in energy companies this year and many have suffered heavier losses than their peers as a result of ill-timed bets.The moves into shares of frackers, refiners and integrated oil conglomerates reflect a gamble that the sector will rebound after rising supply and slowing global growth triggered a nearly 60 percent slide in crude prices since the middle of 2014.But so far, the gambit has not paid off.""We are kind of holding our nose to buy them, but we see value there,"" said Ernesto Ramos, who oversees about $15 billion in large-cap equity assets at BMO Asset Management. ""We've been selling the defensive part of the portfolio exposed negatively to higher interest rates, such as consumer staples and utilities, and making room for what we see as a slow but gradual recovery in world growth.""BMO's Large-Cap Value Fund boosted it energy exposure to 13 percent from 10 percent at the end of February after buying more shares of ExxonMobil Corp and refiner Valero Energy Corp , for example.With oil prices down, ExxonMobil is seen as a defensive play because its refineries and chemicals manufacturing can benefit from lower input costs and offset lower profits from crude production.Shares of Exxon and other oil majors, such as Chevron Corp  and ConocoPhillips are hardly doing any better than the S&P 500 Energy Index, which is down 25 percent this year.Exxon shares are off 21 percent, while Chevron and Conoco are down 32 percent and 34 percent, respectively, reflecting expectations that the global crude supply glut will persist, ultimately weighing on their returns. A Reuters analysis of 265 actively managed large-cap funds with at least $500 million in assets and combined assets of about $1.8 trillion, revealed that 25 percent of them increased their energy sector bets this year.That overall group of funds produced an average return of minus 7.17 percent so far this year, according to Lipper Inc, a Thomson Reuters company. And three-quarters of the funds that increased  their exposure to energy performed worse than the overall average. (Graphic: link.reuters.com/mug75w)INVESTOR PULLOUT Investors have not been pleased with the shift, pulling nearly $27 billion from funds that increased exposure to energy, according to Lipper data.

BMO's Ramos said managers and investors have to remain patient with their energy picks.""We think we will eventually be rewarded with these stocks,"" he said.The $2 billion Ridgeworth Large Cap Value Equity Fund  made among the biggest bets on the energy sector among its peers earlier this year, raising its exposure to 14 percent at the end of August from 6.7 percent at the end of February, according to Lipper. The fund nearly doubled its stake in ConocoPhillips and bought more shares in EOG Resources, Hess Corp and Noble Energy Inc, disclosures show.All of those stocks are down at least 19 percent over the past three months, badly underperforming broad benchmarks. The Ridgeworth fund's year-to-date total return of minus 13 percent is worse than 88 percent of similar funds, according to Morningstar Inc. Mills Riddick, manager of the fund, declined to comment for this story.Other portfolio managers who bet big on some energy stocks, thinking they found bottom, or somewhere near it, have been sorely disappointed, too.Take the $68 billion Investment Company of America fund , which bought nearly 23 million shares of former shale oil boom star Chesapeake Energy Corp during the first half of the year. That represented just 0.50 percent of the fund's assets, but still hurt as Chesapeake shares dropped 43 percent during that time. Chesapeake stock has fallen 70 percent since November, and 39 percent since June, to below $7 a share.The fund, run by Capital Group's American Funds, declined to comment, saying as a matter of policy the company does not discuss individual holdings. The fund's year-to-date total return of minus 8.90 percent is worse than that of 66 percent of peers, according to Lipper. The fund is not alone as many other managers have made bets on the belief that the slump in oil prices would be short-lived.By contrast, large-cap portfolio managers that did not get caught up in the shale oil boom and remained skeptical about crude recovery delivered positive returns for their investors, according to the analysis.Sonu Kalra, manager of the $20 billion Fidelity Blue Chip Growth Fund, has kept his portfolio's exposure to energy below 2 percent of assets.His fund's year-to-date total return of minus 2.85 percent is better than that of 73 percent of its peers.

63,"  HOUSTON The large crude distillation unit at Valero Energy Corp's 335,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) Port Arthur, Texas, refinery was affected by the malfunction of a hydrotreating unit on Tuesday, according to sources familiar with plant operations.The malfunction of the 47,000-bpd Gulfiner hydrotreater due to a leak and compressor shutdown quickly affected the 50,000 bpd Platformer reforming unit and then the 268,000 bpd CDU known as AVU 146, the sources said.Valero was working on fixing the malfunction overnight and hopes to restore normal production on Wednesday, according to the sources. A hydrotreater uses hydrogen to remove sulfur from motor fuel in compliance with U.S. environmental regulations. A reformer converts low-octane refining byproducts into gasoline blending components that boost octane in gasoline. A crude distillation unit does the initial refining of crude oil coming into a refinery and provides feedstock for all other units.

66,"   By Erwin Seba | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N) was readying its 180,000 barrel per day (bpd) Memphis, Tennessee, refinery for possible flooding as early as this weekend, a company spokesman said on Wednesday.""We are preparing for potential flooding in the Memphis area, but we don't expect it to affect operations of our docks or our refinery,"" spokesman Steven Lee said. Heavy floods that shut a 76-mile (122-kilometer) stretch of the Mississippi River between Missouri and Illinois on Wednesday are expected to move south along the river to Memphis over the weekend.Bloomberg News reported Wednesday that Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) was closing a refined products terminal at Memphis ahead of possible flooding. An Exxon spokesman declined on Wednesday night to confirm the terminal would be shut.""We are monitoring the weather and potential flooding in the Memphis area,"" Exxon's Todd Spitler said in a statement. ""Should the terminal be impacted by flooding, we will work to meet obligations to our customers.""  A source familiar with Valero's preparations said this weekend's high water is not expected to reach levels seen during flooding in 2011, when the refinery's docks were nearly inundated. Valero's docks are at a higher elevation than the Exxon Terminal docks.This weekend's river crest at Memphis is forecast to be several feet below the 2011 level, said the source, who requested anonymity because he is not authorized to speak publicly about the company's operations. The refinery's production units are not expected to be at risk from flooding along the Mississippi, the source said.The Valero refinery is a major supplier of jet fuel to the FedEx Corp (FDX.N) hub in Memphis.

67,"  HOUSTON U.S. oil producers, refiners and logistics companies have dozens of crude-by-rail project throughout the United States, although U.S. crude movements via rail retreated to 785,143  barrels per day in the third quarter of 2015 from more than 1 million bpd in the second half of 2014. Oil-by-rail movements started to decline in the fourth quarter of 2014 as a global supply glut sent oil prices spiraling. Discounts of domestic and Canadian heavy crudes to U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate and London’s Brent narrowed sharply as well, prompting coastal refiners to take more imports with spreads too thin to absorb rail's extra transportation costs. The East and West coasts, in particular, have used rail to tap cheaper U.S. and Canadian heavy crude with no major oil pipelines in operation to move inland crude to those markets. U.S. Gulf Coast refineries built to run heavy oil also receive Canadian crude via rail, as well as domestic oil.Some, mainly on the West Coast, have faced lengthy delays and opposition.The staff of the San Luis Obispo County planning commission this week recommended rejecting permits for Phillips 66’s proposed 41,000 bpd project at its Santa Maria refinery in Arroyo Grande, California, because of “significant and unavoidable” impacts from toxic emissions, water and farmland contamination, and fires and explosions if trains derail or leak. The commission will consider permits at a two-day hearing next week.Valero Energy Corp’s proposed 70,000 bpd rail project at its San Francisco-area refinery in Benicia, California, will go before the city’s planning commission Feb. 8 in a public hearing. The commission will schedule additional meetings on Feb. 9 and 10 to hear more public comment as warranted.Both companies first proposed the projects in 2013 with hopes of startup in 2014. Lengthy environmental reviews delayed those plans.Growth of oil-by-train shipments started more than five years ago as pipeline infrastructure lagged booming U.S. and Canadian crude production. The Association of American Railroads said 785,143 bpd originated on top U.S. railroads in the third quarter of 2015, down 8.9 percent from the second quarter this year and down more than 23 percent from the peak of 1.02 million bpd in the third quarter of 2014.Oil moved by rail in the third quarter was 8.4 percent of 9.3 million bpd, the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s estimate of average U.S. output in 2015.Once seen as a stopgap to move crude until pipelines get built, rail became part of the transportation mix, adding flexibility for refiners to choose the best-priced crude from shale and tight oil plays rather than just rely on pipelines. Contracts are shorter, and they are not locked into specific types of crude moved from fixed points via pipeline.Here is a rundown of more than 100 U.S. rail projects, both loading at production sites and unloading at refineries and terminals:           WEST COAST                                                                                       Company Name   Type    Location      State   Capacity      Crude           Status                                                                   (bpd)                                              Tesoro Corp    Ref     Anacortes     WA      50,000        Bakken          Operational                                                                  (refinery                                                                                       120,000 bpd)                                       U.S. Oil and   Ref     Tacoma        WA      40,000        Bakken          Operational                     Refining;

68,"   By Kristen Hays | HOUSTON  HOUSTON County planners want to squash Phillips 66's proposal to transport heavy crude by rail to one of its California refineries, saying it is too risky to public health and the environment. The staff of San Luis Obispo County's planning commission this week recommended that commissioners reject the project because of ""significant and unavoidable"" impacts from toxic emissions and contaminated water to fires and explosions if trains derail or leak.That recommendation came a week before a public hearing Feb. 4-5 on whether to grant permits allowing the company to build the 41,000 barrels per day project first proposed in 2013.It is one of several rail projects on the U.S. West Coast that have undergone lengthy environmental reviews while facing heated opposition in light of fiery crude train crashes since mid-2013. ""We understand that there are concerns about the project and we look forward to addressing questions"" in the review, Phillips spokesman Dennis Nuss said on Tuesday. The Benicia Planning Commission will hold a similar hearing Feb. 8, with more if necessary, on Valero Energy Corp's proposed 70,000 bpd rail project - also delayed pending reviews - at its refinery there. Unlike other proposals that aim to receive both light inland U.S. and Canadian heavy crude via rail, the Phillips project would handle just heavy crude at its Santa Maria refinery in Arroyo Grande, California. That plant is built to process heavy oil produced in California. Once initially processed, it moves via pipeline more than 200 miles north to the company's refinery in Rodeo near San Francisco to turn into fuels. The two plants' combined capacity is 120,200 barrels per day.Phillips proposed the rail project because California oil output is shrinking and the company wanted another source of crude. The company had hoped to start up in 2014, but environmental reviews pushed final consideration of permits to 2015 and then this year.Crude by rail has declined since mid-2014 as U.S. oil prices slid more than 70 percent and discounts of domestic crude to global crudes that once topped $20 narrowed to less than $1. Cheaper domestic crude helps cover extra transportation costs of rail, but a narrow spread entices coastal refiners to take imports instead.Last month Phillips started up its own joint-venture rail loading terminal in North Dakota, shipping crude loaded on railcars from trucks to its New Jersey refinery, Nuss said.

72,"   By Chris Prentice | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Valero Energy Corp filed lawsuits against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Friday to push the regulator to alter a U.S. policy designed to boost use of renewables in transportation fuels. The country's top refiner and No. 3 ethanol producer filed a challenge with the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington to review the EPA's latest Renewable Fuel Standard plans for 2014-2016. It separately asked the court to reopen its standards from 2010 and 2007, according to court documents dated Feb. 12.This is the latest push by refiners to move the responsibility of complying with the program further downstream. Oil refiners are required to meet EPA targets for biofuel use. Those without adequate capacity to blend ethanol with gasoline have to buy compliance credits in a thinly traded market.     Each year, the EPA is required to set targets for biofuel use. In November, it set volumes for 2014-2016 below a 2007 plan laid out by Congress, disappointing both the oil and biofuel industries.     This was the first time EPA used a ""general waiver authority"" to lower the volumes, acknowledging a so-called blend wall that oil companies say is the saturation point for use of ethanol in gasoline without a major overhaul at fuel pumps and in vehicles.     That milestone made the time ripe to revisit what Valero sees as a major logistics issue with the program, said Bracewell's Richard Alonso, counsel to the company.    ""If EPA is going to use an extraordinary action like a waiver, then at least EPA must remove any structural impediments that prevent penetration of renewable fuels,"" Alonso said.     Moving obligations to marketing companies that own the fuel at the time of blending will help to boost biofuels because the groups required to comply will also have the capacity to blend, he said.    Delta Air Lines Inc's Monroe Energy LLC, a merchant refinery without blending ability, filed its own lawsuit requesting a similar change late last month.     The Renewable Fuel Standard program has been a battleground between Big Oil and Big Corn since it was introduced more than a decade ago. Criticism from environmentalists, oil groups and others has increased in that time.    Valero had also filed a petition with the EPA directly to consider the change.

73,"   By Kristen Hays | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Valero Energy Corp's proposed oil-by-rail project at its northern California refinery was quashed by local planners this week, the first such facility on the U.S. West Coast to end a years-long wait for permits with a rejection.The Benicia Planning Commission late Thursday unanimously renounced Valero's request to build the project at the conclusion of four consecutive public hearings dominated by scores of opponents.Valero first proposed building the rail facility at its 145,000 barrels per day Benicia refinery to offload up to 70,000 bpd of inland U.S. and Canadian heavy crude three years ago. Several other West Coast rail projects await such decisions by local or state governments. Those include Tesoro Corp's proposed 360,000 bpd railport in Washington State - the largest in the nation - and Phillips 66's newly-trimmed 25,000 bpd facility at its Santa Maria refinery in Arroyo Grande, California.Others gave up with U.S. crude prices down more than 70 percent since mid-2014 on global oversupply. That decline squeezed discounts of inland U.S. crude to global crudes, eroding oil-by-rail's profitability.  Global Partners LP last month laid off workers and said the company would drop crude handling at its ethanol terminal in Oregon in the fallout of the oil rout.Valero can ask the Benicia City Council to override planners and approve a permit for the project. A spokeswoman said on Friday that the company would ""evaluate our options for appeal.""  The staff for Benicia's planners recommended approval.When Valero first proposed the project, oil-by-rail was growing fast and U.S. and Canadian crudes were much cheaper than global crudes, even with added transportation costs of moving via train. Rail also gave West Coast refiners a way to tap those crudes as no major oil pipelines cross the Rocky Mountains.Not anymore.

78,"   By Marianna Parraga and Erwin Seba | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Venezuelan PDVSA's unit in the United States, Citgo Petroleum, is working to restart some processing units at the Aruba refinery under a 25-year lease contract with the government of the Caribbean island, sources at the facility and firms involved told Reuters on Saturday.The Aruba refinery's former operator, Valero Energy Corp, has not been involved in the negotiations, but the island has guaranteed the U.S. company that it can walk away from the refinery with zero environmental liability and without obligation to dismantle it.A source from the refinery, with capacity to run 235,000 barrels per day of crude, said a technical team has been working since September on the facility's new configuration, including equipment replacement. Other sources added the process of hiring staff and contractors is about to begin.A spokesman for Aruba's government told Reuters a group of representatives is currently in Houston discussing terms of a possible deal.Valero told Reuters its policy is not to comment on business negotiations. PDVSA and Citgo were not immediately available. Even though PDVSA's financial condition is weak amid low crude prices, its subsidiary Citgo enjoyed some relief in 2015 due to higher refining margins, which would allow it to direct a portion of its profit to Aruba.Last month, the catalysts used at Aruba's hydrodesulfurization unit (HDS) were removed and new ones are planned for purchase, one of the sources said. But the restart date has yet to be defined. Operational units could take more than two years to get ready, another source said, because of the long time the facility has been idled.U.S. Valero Energy halted Aruba refining operations in 2012 due to low profit. In 2014 it reclassified the facility as ""abandoned,"" except for terminals currently used by it and PDVSA.Aruba would offer a good way for PDVSA to produce heavy naphtha that it currently imports as diluent for its extra heavy oil output, and it would also produce refining feedstock for Citgo, according to the sources. It is still unclear if the lease agreement will also include the terminal, but one of the sources said Valero has been reluctant to let it go.The island's energy ministry in September confirmed a memorandum of understanding had been signed to explore reopening the facility.

80,"  U.S. refiner Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N) reported a lower-than-expected profit as margins fell in the first quarter due to a build-up of diesel and gasoline inventories.The company's shares were down 3.8 percent at $57.53 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange, amid a broader decline in energy stocks.In February, at least five U.S. refiners voluntarily reduced output in the most widespread cuts since the global financial crisis.U.S. refiners ramped up production in 2015, leading to higher inventories and weaker margins this year as demand softened during the mild winter.Crack spreads, the difference between the prices of crude oil and refined products, have narrowed sharply due to a spike in distillate and gasoline inventories in the United States.The company's refining throughput margin fell to $7.96 per barrel in the first quarter, from $12.39 per barrel last year. After adjustments, Valero reported earnings of 60 cents per share, while analysts, on average, were expecting earning of 66 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Valero's refineries operated at 96 percent throughput capacity utilization in the first quarter, down from 97 percent in the preceding quarter. Rival Phillips 66 (PSX.N) reported last week a 40 percent drop in profit, while Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC.N) barely eked out a profit in the first quarter.Valero's profit fell 49 percent in the quarter.Net income attributable to shareholders fell to $495 million, or $1.05 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from $964 million, or $1.87 per share, a year earlier. Operating revenue fell 26.3 percent to $15.71 billion in the quarter.Up to Monday's close of $59.82, Valero's New York-listed shares have fallen 15.4 percent this year, while the S&P 500 oil & gas refining & marketing sub-index .SPLRCENRM has fallen 13.3 percent over the same period.

83,"  LONDON U.S. energy group Phillips 66 (PSX.N) is in the final stages of selling the only oil refinery in Ireland, a source familiar with negotiations said on Saturday. Phillips 66 did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the 71,000 barrel per day refinery which is in Cork in southern Ireland.Responding to a report on the Irish Examiner website, which said an agreement to sell the Whitegate refinery would be reached within the coming weeks, the source said a deal was ""in the offing"".The Examiner said ArcLight Capital, Irving Oil, UK-based PTFPlusOne and Valero Energy (VLO.N) were in the running, and that family-owned Canadian company Irving Oil was the frontrunner. Valero, Irving Oil and ArcLight Capital did not respond to immediate request for comment while PTFPlusOne could not be reached for comment.Phillips 66 has made repeated attempts to sell the refinery since it first put it up for sale in 2013, but poor refining margins and the limited strategic appeal of the plant have meant there has been scant interest. It was unclear whether the potential buyers intended to keep the plant open or close it and use it for storage only.Phillips 66 employs 157 staff and around 150 contractors at Whitegate, according to the U.S. company's website. A wave of refineries across Europe shut their gates and were turned into storage facilities earlier in the decade, but lower futures prices have helped to prevent further closures in the last two years.    (Reporting by Simon Falush, writing by Andy Bruce; Editing by Kevin Liffey/Keith Weir)",2016-05-22,VLO,"Sun May 22, 2016 | 3:53am EDT",UPDATE 2-Phillips 66 in final stages of selling Ireland's only oil refinery - sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/phillips-refinery-ireland-idUSL5N18I0IJ?type=companyNews

90,"   By Chris Prentice | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N), the largest U.S. refiner, expects to get hit with a half-billion-dollar bill in the second half of the year thanks to the rising cost of meeting government mandates to blend biofuels.For the full year, the company's cost to blend renewable fuels like ethanol will swell to between $750 million to $850 million, mainly to pay for the paper credits used to meet the U.S. biofuels program, the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), the San Antonio, Texas-based refiner said on Tuesday as it reported second-quarter results.The RFS program requires oil refiners and importers to blend more renewable fuel or buy paper credits in an opaque, sometimes volatile market. Compliance credits to meet the standards, known as Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs), were about 25 percent higher in the second quarter than a year earlier.It is another blow for the company, which is already dealing with weak refining margins.The price tag would be up from the $440 million Valero paid for biofuels compliance in 2015, the most it has paid to meet RFS requirements since at least 2009, according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings.  Valero spent about $334 million in the first six months of 2016 on biofuels compliance, the company said.Elevated costs for RINs credits are one of the headwinds the company faces, said John Locke, Valero's vice president of investor relations, on a call with investors.  The biofuels program was launched more than a decade ago to boost the use of renewables to cut greenhouse gas emissions and promote energy independence. This year's more ambitious requirements could hurt U.S. refiners, already facing what could be their worst year since the shale boom began.That puts expected second-half costs at as much as $516 million, nearly matching the $517 million it spent for all of 2013, when RIN prices surpassed a record of $1.40 apiece. The current price is around 96 cents.Prices of RINs have been rising since regulators set annual targets in May for the amount of biofuels including ethanol required to blend with gasoline and diesel and as worries have mounted of tightening inventories.  ""If I'm a refiner with a lot of gasoline and distillate production, why wouldn't I be concerned about rising RIN prices? The conditions are there for them to (rise),"" said Timothy Cheung, vice president at ClearView Energy Partners in Washington. He estimated that RIN prices could rise another 25 percent by year-end.Valero and companies such as Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N), which owns a refinery, are stepping up their push to get regulators to tweak the program to shift onus to comply further downstream.

The views expressed are his own)* Chart 1: tmsnrt.rs/2a1IqJM* Chart 2: tmsnrt.rs/2a1Ifhw* Chart 3: tmsnrt.rs/2ad74DGBy John KempLONDON, July 28 The accumulation of gasoline stocks in the United States has been driven by excess gasoline production rather than lack of demand, according to Valero, the largest independent refiner in the United States.""A lot of it is really more a result of utilisation, especially utilisation in periods where we typically see refineries cut,"" the company noted during its second quarter earnings call on Tuesday.""Typically we see refineries cutting in the fourth quarter and the first quarter, and this year we saw refineries running very high utilisation rates"" due to the steep contango in the gasoline futures market.Valero's comments corroborate data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showing refineries running at record rates between November and March (tmsnrt.rs/2a1IqJM).Consumption of gasoline and distillate in the domestic and export markets ""remain robust"" executives told analysts (Conference call transcription, SeekingAlpha, Jul 28).The company exported record volumes of gasoline and distillate fuel combined in the second quarter, particularly to Latin America, but gasoline sales at home also showed strong growth.RUNNING IN WINTER  Valero executives were quizzed by analysts on whether demand had been overstated or whether the problem was on the supply side.Valero chief Joseph Gorder responded: ""our gasoline volumes through the wholesale are up 3 percent, and even on the distillate side, we're moving about 1 percent more through the wholesale channel of diesel than we did last year.""""We've seen very strong product demand"", the company's head of supply and operations explained, but ""refinery utilisation has been such that we have been able to keep up and even outpace demand.""""With the steep contango in the market, especially early in the year, some marginal refining capacity that typically you would see cut in the winter had incentive to go ahead and run and produce summer grade gasoline"".Very high rates of refinery utilisation, especially in January and February, resulted in an overhang of refined products that has persisted through the middle of the year.The steep contango in futures prices at the start of the year encouraged refiners to produce summer-grade gasoline and send it into storage (""U.S. refiners pay price for making too much gasoline"", Reuters, Jul 14). MAXIMISING GASOLINE The big premium for gasoline over middle distillates also encouraged refiners to shift their refining operations to produce as much gasoline as possible and reduce production of heating oil, diesel and jet fuel (tmsnrt.rs/2a1Ifhw and tmsnrt.rs/2ad74DG).""We've been in a strong maximum gasoline signal for the most part up until about a month ago,"" the company's head of engineering explained, ""so our assets we just had them pointed to make as much gasoline as possible"".The company foresees the need for some run cuts by the refining industry during the third and fourth quarter to rebalance the market though it would not be drawn on its own plans.But the company did note that it had switched from maximising gasoline production to maximising the output of jet fuel by changing the cut points in its distillation process. ECONOMIC RUN CUTS The company denied it would use the forthcoming maintenance period to implement additional cuts in refinery throughput though it noted that other refiners might try to do so.""We have a strategy of planning our turnarounds a couple of years in advance ... We have a big system and we don't try to move our turnarounds based on what prompt economics are. (But) in the rest of the industry there may be some of that,"" the company's engineering chief observed.""I'm sure that people are looking at whether the refineries are struggling from a maintenance perspective and they may bring maintenance forward"" and fix systems early as an effective economic run cut, he added.EAST COAST IMPORTS Valero executives were also asked why the United States was still importing so much gasoline, especially to the East Coast, where the build up of stockpiles has also been highest.The continued importation of so much gasoline, as well as crude oil, at a time when domestic oil producers and refiners are struggling, has become politically controversial.Valero explained its big refineries along the U.S. Gulf Coast have a ""competitive advantage"" exporting to Mexico and South America rather than moving gasoline to U.S. Northeast because of the Jones Act shipping restrictions.Shipping gasoline from the Gulf Coast to the U.S. Northeast is more expensive because the law requires Valero to use U.S. flagged and built vessels with U.S. officers and crews.""The natural flow of our barrels is to south into South America and there's been an incentive to send barrels from Northwest Europe into New York Harbor.""

99,"   By Mike Stone and Jessica Resnick-Ault | NEW YORK/HOUSTON  NEW YORK/HOUSTON LyondellBasell Industries NV (LYB.N) has retained Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N) to help with the potential sale of its 263,776 barrel-per-day refinery in Houston, according to two people familiar with the talks.The move comes after the Dutch chemical company fielded inquiries from at least four possible suitors, the sources said. The process is expected to start in earnest after the U.S. Labor Day holiday in early September, one of the two sources said. The Houston unit is a significant Gulf Coast refinery that can run a wide variety of crude oils, from light Bakken to heavier grades out of Canada. A sale could bring increased competition among Gulf Coast refiners as two of the potential bidders have no presence in the U.S. refinery row.Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N), Saudi Aramco, Cenovus Energy Inc  (CVE.TO) and Suncor Energy Inc (SU.TO) are among the companies that have expressed interest in the refinery, said the sources, who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss the talks.Canadian energy firms Suncor and Cenovus do not have any refineries in the Gulf Coast, and the Houston unit would give them a place to process heavier Canadian crudes they produce. A LyondellBasell Industries spokeswoman said in an email Thursday: ""We believe that in the longer term, the refinery may be more valuable as part of a larger refining system. We are exploring all options. However, no decisions have been made."" She declined to elaborate. Lyondell has sent an email to employees that the refinery is for sale, according to sources who have seen the email.Suncor and Valero declined to comment. Saudi Aramco and Cenovus did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Representatives from Saudi Aramco were seen touring the facility earlier this year, two Gulf Coast sources told Reuters on Thursday. Earlier this year, LyondellBasell Industries Chief Executive Bob Patel told attendees at an industry conference that he expected the refinery would eventually be put on the selling block, but did not offer any time frame.""In the longer term, I can't help but think it's more valuable as part of a refining system than as part of a chemical company,"" Patel said. Lyondell management has consistently described the Houston refinery as a primary source of feedstocks for the company's petrochemical plants, three of which are in industrial suburbs of Houston.  In 2005, Lyondell and minority partner Citgo Petroleum Corp [PDVSAC.UL] put the refinery up for sale to end a partnership that had unraveled after 12 years.The bids for the plant reached between $5 billion and $6 billion before the sale was canceled and Lyondell bought out Citgo's minority stake for $2.1 billion, or $19,000 per barrel of crude oil refining capacity.Since that time, U.S. refinery values have fallen drastically with plants selling for less than $5,000 per barrel.

101,"  HOUSTON Valero Energy Corp shut the large crude distillation unit and a coking unit on Monday night at the 335,000-barrel-per-day Port Arthur, Texas, refinery as part of an ongoing plant-wide overhaul, said sources familiar with plant operations.The 268,000-bpd AVU-146 CDU is scheduled to be shut for four weeks, while the 100,000-bpd coker is scheduled to be shut until late October, the sources said. During the overhaul, which began in late August, the refinery's two crude distillation units, a hydrocracker, a coker and a reformer among other units are scheduled to be shut for planned work. Gasoline and diesel production are planned to be reduced, but not shut down, sources told Reuters in June. Crude distillation units do the initial refining of crude oil coming into the refinery and provide feedstock for all other units. Cokers refine residual crude oil into motor fuel feedstock or petroleum coke, a substitute for coal.

102,"   By Liz Hampton | HOUSTON  HOUSTON North Dakota oil producers were dealt another blow this week when Royal Dutch Shell said it would scrap plans to build an oil train terminal in Washington state that would have taken over 400,000 barrels per week of Bakken and other inland crudes.Shell's move on Thursday comes at a bad time for Bakken producers, who have endured a two-year price rout and need new routes to move their oil to coastal refineries.Inland North American producers have seen four projects stymied since September, owing to both environmental opposition and an oversupplied global oil market that make it easier and cheaper to import cargoes than transport inland crude thousands of miles on railcars.On Wednesday, San Luis Obispo, California, city planners rejected a rail terminal proposed by Phillips 66, two weeks after the city council of Benicia rejected Valero Energy's proposed 70,000 barrel per day (bpd) facility.Not long before that, protests by Native Americans worried about environmental impact prompted the U.S. government to halt work on the 470,000 bpd Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), which would take North Dakota oil to the Midwest and Gulf Coast.The potential loss of takeaway capacity on DAPL and a drop in West Coast demand could spell more pain for producers in the Bakken, where output has fallen by more than 15 percent on the prolonged rout in oil prices. ""This development (with Shell), along with the developments regarding the DAPL, will hurt Bakken producers' netbacks,"" Sarp Ozkan, a senior energy market analyst with Denver-based Ponderosa Advisors, said in reference to profits.  Shell said the conditions of the global crude market and a tight capital environment made its project uneconomic.Shell's rail facility would have connected to an existing rail line and supplied Shell's 145,000 bpd Anacortes refinery with light crude from North Dakota.Phillips 66 this week said it is considering appealing the City Planning Commission's decision.Current pipeline and refining capacity out of the Bakken is around 851,000 bpd, and about 60 percent of its output leaves the region on pipeline, according to the state's pipeline authority. Nearly all of the rest goes by rail, which has loading capacity around 1.52 million bpd. Despite the latest setbacks, Jonathan Garrett, a principal analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie, said low prices are still a bigger concern for North Dakota producers than transportation.""The biggest challenge to the Williston Basin right now isn't transportation, it's oil prices. Takeaway capacity is a concern but that's not going to be the thing that makes the Williston Basin a difficult place to operate,"" he said. Benchmark U.S. oil prices have jumped by more than $6 per barrel in the last week following news that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has reached an agreement to curb supply, with West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures settling above $50 per barrel on Thursday. Higher oil prices could unleash a wave of supply from the Bakken, which as of June had more than 700 drilled-but-uncompleted wells, more than any other major shale region in the United States, according to data from Wood Mackenzie.Bakken discounts to WTI have narrowed sharply since 2013, and in early October were at about $1.That is good for Bakken producers, but makes paying for costly rail too expensive for West Coast refiners.Railed volumes entering the West Coast from the Midwest fell to around 106,000 barrels per day this summer, off 43 percent from a peak in November 2015, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
