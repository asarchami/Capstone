0,"  Pipeline company Williams Partners LP (WPZ.N) said it would buy certain Canadian gas assets from Williams Cos Inc (WMB.N) for about $1.2 billion to boost its natural gas liquid treating and processing business.The deal will include the purchase of about 260 miles of pipelines, an oil sand offgas processing plant near Fort McMurray, Alberta and two facilities at Redwater, Alberta.Williams Cos owns about 64 percent of Williams Partners, while Williams Partners owns most of Williams Cos' interstate gas pipeline and domestic midstream assets.Williams Partners said the deal will immediately add to its earnings and is expected to contribute to its distributable cash flow.The company said it will fund the acquisition with $25 million in cash and will issue 25.6 million pay-in-kind (PIK) limited partner-units to Williams Cos, all of which can be converted to common units after February 2016. To fund the expansion of the Redwater facility, Williams Partners said it had the option to issue up to $200 million of additional PIK units - a financial instrument that pays interest to bondholders or preferred stockholders with additional debt or equity, instead of cash.The expansion will provide additional fractionation business to Williams Partners related to the development of offgas processing at the CNRL Horizon upgrader facility retained by Williams Cos. Williams Cos in December was the target of two hedge funds which said the U.S. energy company had made recent operational and financial missteps.At that time, the two investors had said the areas they might discuss with Williams Cos included the potential for deals in the energy infrastructure sector. Williams Partners said on Wednesday it plans to close the deal by the end of this month.Robert W. Baird & Co. advised Williams Partners on the deal and Barclays advised Williams Cos.Williams Partners shares closed up 1.3 percent at $49.79, while Williams Cos shares closed up 0.8 percent at $41.22 Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.(Reporting by Anannya Pramanick in Bangalore; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Savio D'Souza)",2014-02-26,WMB,"Wed Feb 26, 2014 | 6:23pm EST",Williams Partners to buy Williams Co's Canadian gas assets for $1.2 billion,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-williampartners-deal-idUSBREA1P21420140226?type=companyNews

5,"  (Adds comment, updates share price in final graph)By Selam Gebrekidan and Scott DiSavinoMarch 31 A pipeline within a liquefied natural gas facility exploded in a rural area of Washington state on Monday and emergency workers continued to work into the evening to minimize the risk of further blasts from a leaking storage tank.Shrapnel from the explosion within the Williams Companies Inc facility caused a leak in one of two LNG storage tanks at the site near Plymouth in southeastern Washington, said Joe Lusignan, a spokesman for the Benton County Sheriff's office.""It's still volatile; it's still under investigation,"" Lusignan said late Monday afternoon.""Because of the potential for explosion, we are focusing on making sure that our citizens are safe,"" Lusignan said.After viewing video footage of the damage taken by a robot brought to the site by the Washington State Patrol bomb squad, Lusignan said law enforcement and hazardous material personnel were preparing to go to the site to evaluate damage first-hand.""They will assess the level of damage, how to repair it and what safety issues we still have for our citizens,"" he said.Road blocks and evacuation orders remained in effect and may continue through the night, Lusignan said. Five workers were injured by the blast, he said. One worker was burned; four were hit by debris and taken to local hospitals, he said.Williams Companies said leaking natural gas has evaporated and there was no indication dangerous vapors were drifting into town, which has about 400 residents.Williams spokeswoman Michele Swaner said the company is investigating. The cause of the explosion has not been determined. Emergency responders evacuated workers and residents in a two-mile (3.2 km) radius, officials said.Each storage tank stands 133.5 feet tall and holds up to 1.2 billion cubic feet of natural gas. Together, the Williams tanks can hold enough gas to meet nearly 3.4 percent of typical daily U.S. natural gas demand. Williams said each tank was around one third full before Monday's explosion. An earlier fire at the site has been extinguished, but Lusignan said an ongoing gas leak could still ignite. Responders said they were containing liquid leaking from the tank.Local media reported that the initial explosion at the gas storage site, which occurred around 8:22 a.m. Pacific time (1522 GMT), could be heard from 20 miles (32 km) away.Experts played down the possibility of a natural gas vapor cloud formation that could explode.""LNG is not as dangerous as some people think. When it is in a liquid state it can't ignite. In a gaseous state it mixes with air,"" said Kent Bayazitoglu, an analyst at Gelber & Associates in Houston. ""The most likely remaining concern is if the gas is trapped"" on site. LNG accidents are rare, but Monday's incident could be held as an example of safety risks by groups opposed to building new U.S. LNG facilities, including export plants.An explosion at a government-owned Sonatrach LNG facility in Algeria killed 27 workers and injured many more in 2004.Companies hoping to build new U.S. LNG plants say safety technology, including the building of dams around storage tanks, has improved in recent years.Williams said it has shut the connections from its main line, called the Northwest Pipeline, to the Plymouth facility.The 3,900-mile-long (6,276-km-long) Northwest Pipeline, which delivers gas to several Western States, is still operating, Williams said.The incident had no discernible impact on U.S. natural gas prices, which fell Monday on the West Coast.Shares of Williams fell 34 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $40.58 on the New York Stock Exchange, while shares of most other energy utilities rose.

12,"  Pipeline operator Williams Companies Inc said on Sunday it agreed to acquire control of Access Midstream Partners LP for $5.99 billion as the first step in merging it with its operations, aiming to enlarge its role in the U.S. natural gas boom.The deal gives Williams, the fourth-largest U.S. pipeline company based on market capitalization, control over the industry's largest gathering and processing master limited partnership (MLP) as measured by throughput volume. A subsequent merger of Williams' MLP, Williams Partners LP, with Access, will, if successful, create one of the largest MLPs by enterprise value - close to $100 billion.Exempt from federal income tax, MLPs have been hugely popular among investors seeking higher yields, even though their structures often have corporate governance standards weaker than those of corporations. Under the agreement unveiled on Sunday, Williams will acquire the 50 percent stake it does not already own in the controlling entity of Access, referred to as the general partner, from infrastructure fund manager Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP).It will also acquire 55.1 million shares in Access, referred to as units, from GIP, boosting its share of Access units from 23 percent to 50 percent. Williams had previously acquired a 50 percent stake in the Access general partner and 23 percent of the Access units in December 2012. Williams said it would pay for the latest deal with equity, debt and cash on hand.In a second transaction, which has yet to be mutually agreed and will have to be approved by conflicts committees set up by the two sides, Williams said it had proposed the merger of Williams Partners LP and Access. Under the deal, Access would effectively acquire Williams Partners in a unit-for-unit exchange at a ratio of 0.85 Access Midstream Partners units per one Williams Partners unit. The proposal also includes an option for Williams Partners unitholders to take either a one-time special payment of $0.81 per unit, or an equivalent value of additional units of Access, to compensate for a lower expected per-unit cash distribution in 2015.Williams also said it plans to increase its third-quarter  dividend by 32 percent, to 56 cents per share. It also provided new dividend-growth guidance of about 15 percent annually between 2014 and 207. Williams Partners owns interests in three major interstate pipelines which, combined, deliver 14 percent of the natural gas consumed in the United States.

14,"   By Michael Shields | SPIELBERG Austria  SPIELBERG Austria Valtteri Bottas gave Finland another presence on the Formula One podium on Sunday when the Williams driver celebrated his first top three finish at the Austrian Grand Prix.""Really, really happy. Difficult to put into words really. Just really thankful to the team for giving me this car,"" the third placed 24-year-old declared.""It’s been a long way for us since last year and many, many years at Williams and now it’s so much better. The race was exactly what we needed at this point – clean, nice, everything went like planned really.""Bottas, the latest in a line of top Finnish drivers that includes former world champions Keke Rosberg, Mika Hakkinen and Kimi Raikkonen, made his debut with Williams last year after a stint as reserve.It turned out to be a miserable season for the former champions, who scored just five points in total and finished ninth overall - a long way from the 1980s and 1990s when they won nine constructors' titles and seven drivers' championships. This season, with a switch from Renault to Mercedes power and technical head Pat Symonds coming on board, they have been a team transformed and are now fifth with 85 points and within reach of Force India and Ferrari.They are still off the pace of dominant Mercedes but started Sunday's race with Brazilian Felipe Massa on pole and Bottas alongside.The Finn followed up his best-ever qualifying with a best-ever result while Massa dropped to fourth. ""I think overall the best-ever weekend,"" said Bottas, who took several long swigs of his champagne before spraying the rest at Mercedes' winner Nico Rosberg and second-placed Lewis Hamilton.""We were really strong the whole weekend and that’s down to all the hard work. Of course it was a good track for us.""You never know what’s going to happen in the next race but overall we are making progress. Step-by-step we are getting there, getting closer to the positions where we belong. I’m really happy,"" he added. Williams had chances earlier in the season but failed to capitalize on them through errors and misfortune but Bottas, who had the fastest pitstop of the race, said they had finally shown what they could do.""From all the data that we had from practice we knew that in the race it’s going to be difficult and overall Mercedes have still got the quickest car,"" he said.""We really nailed it yesterday so we knew that maybe Sunday could be difficult but actually it was a bit better than I expected. We were really close to them on pace.""

23,"   By Sneha Banerjee  Pipeline giant Williams Cos is scrapping its master limited partnership unit by buying Williams Partners LP for about $13.8 billion, the latest in a series of deals in the pipeline industry aimed at simplifying corporate structures.Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) are also being bought out to eliminate incentivized distribution rights, which over time can divert large chunks of cash returns to general partners and starve the company of capital.Distribution payouts are becoming a burden for energy companies at a time when they are struggling to cope with a steep fall in global crude prices.MLP experts say most mature entities eventually need to be unwound.Crestwood Equity Partners said last week it would buy its MLP, Crestwood Midstream Partners, to cut out incentive distribution rights. Earlier this year, Energy Transfer Partners said it would buy affiliate Regency Energy Partners LP for about $11 billion. Industry leader Kinder Morgan Inc brought all its units into a traditional C-Corporation last year.Williams Cos, however, is not completely abandoning the MLP structure. The company still has control of Access Midstream Partners LP, which it agreed to buy last year.Williams Cos is offering 1.115 of its own shares for each Williams Partners' share. The offer works out to $55.86 per share, an 18 percent premium to Williams Partners' Tuesday close. William Cos' shares rose as much as 8.6 percent, while William Partners rose as much as 25.3 percent to $59.41.William Partners' shares have vastly underperformed the stock of its parent over the past year. Up to Tuesday's close, William Cos' shares had risen nearly 14 percent, while William Partners had fallen nearly 15 percent in the last 12 months. The combined company expects third-quarter dividend of 64 cents per share. Williams Cos had previously expected to pay dividend of 60 cents per share, while Williams Partners was expecting to pay out 85 cents.The companies said the deal would reduce cost of capital, freeing up funds for acquisitions. Lower capital cost would also drive a 10-15 percent dividend growth rate through 2020.Barclays and Gibson Dunn were financial and legal advisers, to Williams.

27,"   By Anna Driver | HOUSTON, June 22  HOUSTON, June 22 Energy Transfer Equity's  unsolicited $48 billion offer for Williams Companies Inc  through a corporate structure with tax advantages may be the U.S. pipeline company's best option as potential bids from rivals are complicated by possible antitrust issues and the deal's rich price, investors and analysts said on Monday.Energy's proposed all-equity offer of $64 per share for Williams was rejected by Williams' board who said in a statement on Sunday that it significantly undervalued the company which controls a master limited partnership, or MLP.Deals in the energy sector, especially oil and gas pipeline and processing companies, are turning to a more traditional corporate structure as MLP advantages wane over time. Energy Transfer would be the latest MLP to propose using a c-corporation as a way to maximize tax advantages, increase cash flows and broaden institutional interest.The sector embraces the MLP structure because the tax burden is passed through to investors who receive fat yields. Because the partnership pays no taxes, it has a lower cost of capital.Kinder Morgan Inc last year put all of its publicly traded partnerships into one corporate parent to quell concerns that it had grown too large and complicated.As a partnership grows larger over time, it is frequently required to pay more income to its parent company, a situation that saps its ability to expand and raises the cost of capital. Energy Transfer will still hold a number of MLPs as part of its proposed deal.Kinder Morgan Inc and Enterprise Products Partners, two other pipeline and processing companies, are large enough to make a bid for Williams, analysts said. ""There's not really that many companies in this universe, in midstream, that have the facility to (bid for Williams), said Brandon Blossman, an analyst at energy-focused investment bank Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. ""Kinder Morgan has very similar sort of assets in the mid-Atlantic and North East. Enterprise Partners has historically not shown much interest in large deals, like this.""It would not make sense for Kinder to pay a premium for assets that it would have to turn around and sell, said Quinn Kiley, a managing director at large MLP investor Advisory Research Inc.Additionally, Energy Transfer's bid for Williams could rise to around $70 per share, a price that would likely knock out potential bids from Kinder Morgan or Enterprise, analysts at Credit Suisse said in a note to clients.A spokesman for Kinder Morgan declined to comment. A spokesman for Enterprise Products Partners declined to comment. Williams already has its own plan to acquire its Williams Partners MLP in a $14 billion deal that is expected to close in the fall..The proposed Energy Transfer deal requires that Williams' own deal would be scuttled, the Dallas company said in release late on Sunday. Williams said it is committed to moving its plan forward as its board looks at all strategic options.The offer drove shares of Williams up 24 percent on Monday to $60.

""Whether or not they can deliver the same value over the near term like this offer does is up for debate,"" he said.

37,"   By Greg Roumeliotis and Pamela Barbaglia | NEW YORK/LONDON, June 29  NEW YORK/LONDON, June 29 Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) worldwide in the second quarter of 2015 almost matched the record set in the second quarter of 2007, according to preliminary Thomson Reuters data, as big companies turned to deals to boost their market share.Low interest rates and stronger confidence among chief executives have led to a steady rise in M&A activity in the last two years to close to pre-2008 financial crisis levels. The second quarter of 2015, however, stands out for the number of mega deals that were clinched or attempted.These include Royal Dutch Shell Plc's $70 billion acquisition of British rival BG Group Plc, cable operator Charter Communications Inc's $78.7 billion merger with Time Warner Cable Inc, and chip maker Avago Technologies Ltd's $37 billion acquisition of peer Broadcom Corporation.Such large deals drove M&A volumes globally in the second quarter of 2015 up by 34.6 percent year-on-year to $1.33 trillion as of June 26, shy of the record $1.41 trillion seen in the second quarter of 2007.""Given the consolidation that is going on across numerous sectors, to be a bystander could mean losing ground from a competitive standpoint,"" said Gary Posternack, global head of mergers and acquisitions at Barclays Plc.""Companies are mapping out their industry landscapes, focusing on transactions that could position themselves as industry leaders, and acting aggressively to try to bring them to fruition,"" Posternack added. Consolidation was often sparked by one company exploring a sale and spurring its rivals into action. In the United States, for example, health insurer Humana Inc's decision to put itself on the block prompted peers Cigna Corp, Aetna Inc , Anthem Inc and UnitedHealth Group Inc  to also explore other deals.To be sure, there were several takeover approaches in the quarter that were rebuffed. Cigna has so far snubbed Anthem's $53.8 billion acquisition proposal, natural gas pipeline company Williams Companies Inc rejected a $53.1 billion offer from peer Energy Transfer Equity LP, and generic drug maker Mylan NV is resisting a roughly $50 billion bid by  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, while also seeking to acquire rival Perrigo Company Plc in a hostile $35 billion bid.""The public markets have become more receptive to companies taking control of another company in a transformational way, even when the target may be reluctant to sell or merge,"" said Robin Rankin, global M&A co-head at Credit Suisse Group AG . STRATEGIC DEALS A major difference between the recent M&A boom and that  seen in 2007 is that the latter was to a large extent fueled by private equity-backed leveraged buyouts, as opposed to this year's strategic corporate deals. In fact, the first half of 2015 has seen the slowest six-month period for private equity-backed acquisitions since 2012.""For private equity investors, one of the main issues is the limited supply of assets. They have money to put to work but it proves hard for them to compete against industry players or new money pools in fiercely competitive auctions,"" said Luigi Rizzo, head of M&A for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Bank of America Corp Despite the near-record M&A volumes, and the frothy valuations that have accompanied them, dealmakers say companies that see a strong strategic rationale remain committed to acquisitions.""When you are in the boardroom, discussion is not generally focused on whether we are in a bubble or not, or how long will this M&A trend continue. The discussion is rather about fundamentals, what is happening to operations and how much is the business worth,"" said Stephen Arcano, M&A head at law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP.M&A volumes jumped in all three regions. More companies showed appetite for cross-border dealmaking, with U.S. agrochemicals company Monsanto Co launching a bid for Switzerland's Syngenta AG, and Potash Corp of Saskatchewan Inc going after German peer K+S AG .""Buyers are looking for growth and borders do not represent obstacles. If they can buy something in emerging markets, developed Asia or in Europe, that is consistent with their strategy, that will be what they want to do,"" said Bob Eatroff, Americas M&A co-head at Morgan Stanley.Macro-economic concerns such as Greece's debt crisis and China's interest rate policies did not dampen M&A sentiment in Europe and Asia in the second quarter. Dealmakers say this could change if concerns over Greece or other issue curb risk taking.""The market backdrop in Europe could be described as a form of surreal stability; markets are favorable, but there are potential risks on the horizon which may not yet have been factored in,"" said Robert Leitão, head of Rothschild's global financial advisory team.

41,"   By Mike Stone and Greg Roumeliotis  Energy Transfer Equity LP (ETE.N) has progressed to the second round of bidding for Williams Companies (WMB.N), according to people familiar with the matter, a key milestone in the pipeline company's efforts to clinch a friendly deal with its peer.Energy Transfer has tied up at least seven investment banks that are now working on its bid, the people said, narrowing the financing options for rivals looking to compete for Williams, which has a market capitalization of around $39 billion.The sources asked not to be identified because details of the sale process are confidential. Representatives for Williams and Energy Transfer declined to comment. Williams decided to put itself on the auction block after it rejected an all-stock acquisition proposal from Energy Transfer in June, worth $53.1 billion at the time including the assumption of debt, aimed at disrupting Williams' plans to acquire its pipeline subsidiary Williams Partners LP (WPZ.N) for $14 billion.Energy Transfer will now have to outbid other suitors for Williams to avoid a hostile takeover. The sources said that Williams had attracted other bidders, though it could not be immediately established which other companies made it through to the second round. Houston-based pipeline firms Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N), which has a market capitalization of $73 billion, and much smaller Spectra Energy Corp (SE.N) which has a market capitalization of $20 billion, had expressed interest in Williams, the people said. Kinder Morgan would face significant antitrust hurdles because of its size, the people added.Kinder Morgan and Spectra representatives declined to comment.  The universe of companies that would be in a position to pursue Williams also includes TransCanada Corp (TRP.TO), Enbridge Inc (ENB.TO), Enterprise Product Partners LP (EPD.N) Phillips 66 (PSX.N) and Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC.N), industry sources have said.TransCanada, Enbridge, Enterprise and Marathon did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Phillips 66 declined to comment. Deals in the energy sector, especially oil and gas pipeline and processing companies, are turning to a more traditional corporate structure as advantages associated with a master limited partnership (MLP) wane over time.  Energy Transfer would be the latest MLP to propose using a C-corporation as a way to maximize tax advantages, increase cash flows and broaden institutional interest.The sector had previously embraced the MLP structure because the tax burden is passed through to investors who receive fat yields. Because the partnership pays no taxes, it has a lower cost of capital.

42,"   By Mike Stone  Spectra Energy Corp (SE.N), an oil and natural gas pipeline company, is bidding for the whole of Williams Companies Inc (WMB.N), even though its market capitalization is about half that of Williams, people familiar with the matter said. Tulsa, Oklahoma-based Williams decided to put itself on the auction block after it rejected an all-stock acquisition proposal from rival Energy Transfer Equity LP (ETE.N) in June. At the time the bid was worth $53.1 billion including the assumption of debt; it was contingent upon Williams' canceling its plans to acquire the portion of its pipeline subsidiary Williams Partners LP (WPZ.N) that it does not already own for $14 billion.Houston-based Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N) is also interested in Williams, but would face potential antitrust issues if it proceeded with a bid, the people added.Williams collected an initial round from prospective bidders in late July according to the people.      Final bids for Williams are due the last week of August, the people said, asking not to be named because the discussions were private.Energy Transfer has tied up at least eight investment banks that are now working on its bid, the people said, narrowing the financing options for rivals looking to compete for Williams, which has a market capitalization of around $38.5 billion.Wells Fargo is advising Houston-based Spectra, the people said.

43,"   By Mike Stone | Sept 11  Sept 11 Spectra Energy Corp has exited the auction process for rival pipeline company The Williams Companies Inc, raising the possibility that Energy Transfer Equity LP could succeed in buying the company, people familiar with the discussions said.Williams put itself up for auction in June after it rejected an acquisition proposal from rival ETE. At the time, the bid was worth $53.1 billion, including the assumption of the company's debt. It was contingent upon Williams' canceling its plans to acquire the portion of its pipeline subsidiary Williams Partners LP that it does not already own for $14 billion.Williams Cos said it rejected the offer because it undervalued the company. Its stock dropped $1.30 on Friday to $42.97 on the New York Stock Exchange. Representatives for Williams, Spectra and ETE declined to comment, and the sources asked not to be named because they were not authorized to discuss the talks publicly. Last weekend, Williams' board met to weigh options, including buyout offers collected in August, people briefed on the talks said. Williams is still deciding whether to remain independent or sell itself to ETE, people familiar with the discussions said.ETE and Tulsa, Oklahoma-based Williams are negotiating, the sources said, and are trying to agree over the share portion of the offer. ETE is offering new shares that have never traded in the public market and therefore Williams believes that the valuation for those shares is untested, the people said. Analysts following the transaction said if Williams decides not to sell itself to ETE, the latter could launch a tender offer for Williams' outstanding shares in an appeal directly to shareholders. In a July 7 press release, ETE said ""ETE remains fully committed to taking the necessary steps to implement the proposed transaction with Williams.""Many industry sources believe that statement means ETE could launch a hostile takeover if discussions fall through.

44,"   By Mike Stone and Greg Roumeliotis  Williams Companies' (WMB.N) board of directors is preparing to meet as early as this week to consider a sale to oil and gas pipeline peer Energy Transfer Equity LP (ETE.N) after the latter revised its offer, according to people familiar with the matter.Energy Transfer has offered to tweak its all-stock offer for Williams, which is currently worth about $34 billion, and pay for around 15 percent of the deal with cash, the people said on Wednesday, cautioning that the exact amount of cash offered is still being negotiated.Williams' board will meet to decide whether the company will enter final negotiations with Energy Transfer, the people said. If it decides to do so, it will later hold another board meeting to approve the deal, the people added. The deal would rank as one of this year's largest mergers.The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Energy Transfer declined to comment, while Williams did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Williams began exploring an outright sale in June after it rejected an acquisition proposal from Energy Transfer. At the time, the bid was worth $48 billion. That offer was contingent upon Williams' canceling its plans to acquire the portion of its pipeline subsidiary Williams Partners LP (WPZ.N) that it does not already own for $14 billion.Energy Transfer and William's share prices have dropped since then, alongside plummeting oil prices. Energy Transfer prevailed in the auction for Williams and has been trying to convince Williams to agree to a deal.  Under Energy Transfer's new offer, Tulsa, Oklahoma-based Williams shareholders would be able to elect newly issued Energy Transfer shares, or a combination of those shares and a cash consideration, the people said.Deals in the energy sector, especially oil and gas pipeline and processing companies, are turning to a more traditional corporate structure as advantages associated with a master limited partnership (MLP) wane over time.

45,"   By Anannya Pramanick and Shubhankar Chakravorty  Pipeline giant Energy Transfer Equity LP (ETE.N) will buy rival Williams Cos Inc (WMB.N) in a deal valued around $33 billion, nearly a third less than the same offer Williams had rejected in June for being too small. The takeover ends a pursuit stretching back to January and marks the first major buyout of a midstream company since oil prices crashed. It will create one of the world's largest energy infrastructure companies, alongside Kinder Morgan Inc. and Enterprise Products Partners (EPD.N).The mostly stock offer of $43.50 a share comes with the same exchange ratio as an unsolicited bid three months ago that had an implied value of $53.3 billion. Williams turned that down,  but its worth has sunk by a third since then as an energy slump that started in mid-2014 drags on. Energy Transfer will take on $4.2 billion in Williams liabilities and issue $6 billion in new debt to finance the transaction. Investors panned the deal, sending Williams, Energy Transfer and their affiliates down around 10 percent in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange after it became clear the original offer was not sweetened. The accepted offer includes an option to receive 18 percent of the payment in cash.""Right now energy is sort of a toxic environment,"" said Quinn Kiley, a managing director at large MLP investor Advisory Research, adding that even a company like Williams with no exposure to crude oil prices has been badly battered in the downturn.The deal comes at a time when crude oil's more than 50 percent plunge has spoiled investors' appetite for pipeline companies' master limited partnerships (MLPs).Balance sheets have been stretched by a nearly 30 percent drop in the value of a partnerships, leaving mergers and joint ventures as one of the best means remaining to deliver the yield growth that is essential to attracting investors.         'MORE STABILITY' Williams will give Energy Transfer Chief Executive Kelcy Warren a new foothold in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and a dominant position in the fastest-growing natural gas market in the United States: the Northeast's Marcellus Shale. Warren's company is already strong on the Gulf Coast and Midwest in natural gas, crude oil and refined products. Williams shares fell 9.7 percent to nearly two-year-low of $37.59 on Monday, below the offer price of $43.50 per share. Energy Transfer shares were down 11.5 percent at $20.56.Still, Williams Chief Executive Alan Armstrong told investors the new company would be stronger. ""As a combined company, we will have ... more stability in an environment of low commodity prices,"" he said.    Williams stockholders electing to receive stock will get 1.8716 Energy Transfer shares for each share held. Williams stockholders will also receive a special one-time dividend of $0.10 per share to be paid immediately before the closing of the deal - expected by the first half of 2016.Energy Transfer had said that its offer was contingent on the termination of Williams' pending acquisition of natural gas master limited partnership Williams Partners, in which Williams holds a 66 percent interest.  Williams Partners said on Monday it would terminate the deal and receive $428 million in a termination fee from Williams.Williams Partners will be one of three large investment grade MLPs held by the combined entity, a corporation called Energy Transfer Corp LP. The other two are Equity Transfer Partners LP (ETP.N) and Sunoco Logistics Partners LP (SXL.N).But the use of a traditional C-corp entity as the acquisition vehicle in this deal is the latest sign that major energy companies are leaning away from MLPs.Kinder Morgan scrapped its MLPs last year and reorganized as a C-corp to quell concerns it had grown too complicated.Investors like MLPs because their tax-free structure helps generate hefty yields, but the structures can become unwieldy.As a partnership grows larger over time, it is frequently required to pay more income to its parent company because of so-called incentive distribution rights. These can sap its ability to expand and raise the cost of capital.

46,"  Pipeline operator Williams Partners LP, a master limited partnership of Williams Companies Inc, cut its 2016 capital budget by about $1 billion, or by almost a third, to $2 billion.The company said the spending plan reduction was due to delays and cancellations in its projects on the back of the current commodity price environment as well as sharply higher costs of raising capital.Oil prices remain near 12-year lows as global supply continues to outstrip demand.

47,"  Chesapeake Energy Corp, the second largest U.S. natural gas producer, said it would make a debt payment due in March and that it planned to sell more assets, slash spending in half and renegotiate pipeline contracts as it aims to lower debt and improve liquidity amid collapsing energy prices.Investors sent shares of the battered company up 15 percent to $2.52 in morning New York Stock Exchange trading.A slide of more than 70 percent in crude prices from highs over $100 a barrel and low natural gas prices have hit the heavily leveraged company hard. To weather the downturn, Chesapeake said it will cut spending more than 50 percent this year.No job cuts were mentioned in Chesapeake's latest moves but in September the company trimmed 740 employees, about 15 percent of its workforce.Earlier this month, Chesapeake said it tapped legal counsel Kirkland & Ellis for advice as it seeks to strengthen its balance sheet with debt exchanges and other transactions, and that it had no plans for bankruptcy as some in the market have speculated.On a conference call with analysts to discuss fourth-quarter results, Chesapeake's chief financial officer Nick Dell'Osso also said the company has oil and gas assets it could pledge as collateral if needed as banks review its loans in the so-called re-determination season in April. ""We feel good about our ability to get through the re-determination season,"" Dell'Osso said.Chesapeake said it plans to sell assets worth $500 million to $1 billion this year and outlined a budget of $1.3 billion to $1.8 billion. Chesapeake has a debt payment of about $500 million due in March, with at least another $1.3 billion coming due through 2018. The company had $9.5 billion in outstanding debt, more than $300 million in cash and a $4 billion credit facility as of Feb. 23.Chesapeake CEO Doug Lawler also said it was aggressively renegotiating pipeline and processing contracts and that it had amended certain transportation agreements in Texas and Louisiana to free up more cash.Oil and gas pipeline companies, including Williams Companies Inc, have contracts worth billions of dollars that might be at risk as low prices sap Chesapeake's cash flow. Chesapeake reported a net loss of $2.23 billion, or $3.36 per share, for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31. It earned $586 million, or 81 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding impairment charges and other items, Chesapeake had a fourth-quarter loss of 16 cents per share. Analysts were expecting a loss of 17 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

48,"  HOUSTON Feb 25 Southwestern Energy Co, said on Thursday it and Williams Companies Inc have negotiated lower rates to gather, transport and process natural gas it produces in West Virginia in exchange for some new business for the pipeline operator.Pipeline operators, once seen as more insulated from commodity price swings by fixed-fee contracts, are now taking price cuts from customers who have seen cash flows sapped by the 20-month crude oil downturn.Southwestern, which has operations in the U.S. Northeast, said the rate reductions will reduce its costs by over $35 million this year.In exchange, Williams will get additional gathering rights on some of Southwestern's acreage in parts of the Utica and Marcellus shale. Chesapeake Energy Corp, which has also won price reductions from Tulsa, Oklahoma-based Williams, said on Wednesday that is was aggressively pursuing new deals with its pipeline operators. Southwestern also reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $2.1 billion, or $5.58 per share, compared with a profit of $312 million, or 89 cents per share in the same period a year earlier.

58,"  Energy Transfer Equity LP (ETE.N) and Williams Companies Inc (WMB.N) agreed on Tuesday to change an administrative requirement for their $20 billion-deal to give U.S. regulators additional time to complete their review of the tie-up.The new timeline may give Energy Transfer time to renegotiate terms of the deal ahead of June 28 - the deadline for the deal to close, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday.The companies said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday that the Securities and Exchange Commission had requested additional information about the deal to be included in the proxy statement, which the companies may not mail to shareholders before the SEC completes its review.Williams shareholders need to vote on the transaction, and the SEC must sign off on the proxy statement before it is sent out to shareholders and a date is set for the vote. The companies agreed to shorten the period between when the proxy and form of election are sent and when the deal can close. The form of election allows Williams shareholders to choose whether they want cash or stock for their shares.Energy Transfer chief executive Kelcy Warren, a Dallas billionaire, set his sights on Williams last year to transform his empire into one of the biggest pipeline networks in the world. However, a prolonged drop in oil and gas prices has made the deal less economically attractive. Williams is suing ETE in Delaware to stop a controversial offering of preferred shares to its top shareholders. It has also sued Energy Transfer's Warren in Texas over the same offering. Williams has alleged that ETE is looking into ways to walk away from the tie-up even though the terms of the deal would not allow that.  The latest obstacle to the deal arose last month, when Energy Transfer said its lawyers may not be able to deliver a tax opinion needed to close the deal. Williams disagrees with the position Energy Transfer's lawyers have taken on the tax issue.

60,"   By Mike Stone  Energy Transfer Equity LP (ETE.N) is taking steps that may enable it to renegotiate its $20 billion cash-and-stock acquisition of Williams Companies Inc (WMB.N), according to people familiar with the matter.Dallas billionaire Kelcy Warren, the chief executive of Energy Transfer, set his sights on Williams last year to transform his empire into one of the biggest pipeline networks in the world. However, a prolonged drop in oil and gas prices has made the deal less economically attractive.Energy Transfer and Williams are in talks to reduce the number of days specified for completing some of the deal's administrative requirements, the people said.This would give them time to engage in renegotiation of terms ahead of a June 28 deadline for the deal to close, the people added.There is no certainty that such renegotiation talks will occur, let alone be successful, the people cautioned.  The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Energy Transfer and Williams declined to comment.Another marquee deal that suffered as result of lower energy prices, U.S. oilfield services provider Halliburton Inc's (HAL.N) $28 billion acquisition of peer Baker Hughes Inc (BHI.N), was pulled on Sunday after it faced objections from antitrust watchdogs.  The latest development comes after Energy Transfer said in April its lawyers may not be able to deliver an important tax opinion for its takeover of Williams, throwing the agreed acquisition into doubt. Since the takeover was announced in September 2015, Energy Transfer launched a controversial offering of preferred shares to its top shareholders, for which it is currently being sued by Williams. Energy Transfer has also fired its chief financial officer and slashed projections for cost savings from the Williams deal. Energy Transfer said last March it expected the base case for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization from commercial synergies from the deal to be about $170 million a year by 2020, compared with previous forecasts of more than $2 billion when the deal was unveiled. The size of the deal has also shrunk to about $20 billion from an original $37.7 billion. In another sign of the deal's troubles, Williams has yet to schedule a vote for its shareholders to approve the transaction with Energy Transfer. Another administrative hurdle is managing how Williams shareholders will be paid for their shares once they elect to receive cash or stock. Energy Transfer would need to take on a heavy debt load to fund the $6 billion cash portion of the deal under the existing terms. Williams said in its lawsuit last month that Energy Transfer has looked into how it might be able to walk away from the merger even though the terms do not allow that.

82,"   By Mike Stone and Michael Erman  Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD.N) approached Williams Companies Inc (WMB.N) earlier this summer about combining their   businesses, two of the largest U.S. oil and gas pipeline operations, people familiar with the matter said.Merging Williams' natural gas liquids business in the northeastern United States with Enterprise's ATEX pipeline, which runs from that region to Texas, could generate significant revenue and cost synergies for Enterprise.The approach came as oil prices began to recover from a steep slump. Its timing suggests that Enterprise was looking to take advantage of Williams' depressed share price as well as upheaval at its board.Enterprise's approach came after peer Energy Transfer Equity LP (ETE.N) terminated its merger agreement with Williams in June after a prolonged legal battle.The value of Enterprise's offer could not be learned. However, a rise in Williams' shares in the past two months means the offer currently carries little or no premium, one of the people said. Williams never made an official response to the approach, that source added.Enterprise has not pursued the matter further either, the source said. The sources asked not to be identified because the discussions were confidential. Williams and Enterprise declined to comment.Since the deal with Energy Transfer broke up, Tulsa, Oklahoma-based Williams has laid out plans to move forward as a stand-alone company while investing more than $1.5 billion in its master limited partnership, Williams Partners LP (WPZ.N). Williams and Williams Partners have taken steps to sell assets to reduce their debt loads. Shares of Williams rose as much 11 percent after Reuters was first to report on Enterprise's approach and ended trading on Thursday up 7.8 percent at $28.11. Enterprise shares closed down 2 percent at $27.02, giving the company a market capitalization of $57 billion. A Delaware judge ruled in June that Energy Transfer could terminate its deal to buy Williams over tax issues. The deal had been in doubt for months, with Williams suing Energy Transfer, accusing the company of breaching the terms of their merger in trying to back out.Energy Transfer had become unhappy with the deal as oil's prolonged downturn put many of its and Williams' customers - major oil and gas producers - in jeopardy, driving down the value of both companies. Energy Transfer pushed for a breakup of the deal even as oil prices climbed back, troubled by the debt it would need to incur  to fund the cash portion of its bid.

83,"   By Mike Stone and Michael Erman  Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD.N) approached Williams Companies Inc (WMB.N) earlier this summer about combining their   businesses, two of the largest U.S. oil and gas pipeline operations, people familiar with the matter said.Merging Williams' natural gas liquids business in the northeastern United States with Enterprise's ATEX pipeline, which runs from that region to Texas, could generate significant revenue and cost synergies for Enterprise.The approach came as oil prices began to recover from a steep slump. Its timing suggests that Enterprise was looking to take advantage of Williams' depressed share price as well as upheaval at its board.Enterprise's approach came after peer Energy Transfer Equity LP (ETE.N) terminated its merger agreement with Williams in June after a prolonged legal battle.The value of Enterprise's offer could not be learned. However, a rise in Williams' shares in the past two months means the offer currently carries little or no premium, one of the people said. Williams never made an official response to the approach, that source added.Enterprise has not pursued the matter further either, the source said. The sources asked not to be identified because the discussions were confidential. Williams and Enterprise declined to comment.Since the deal with Energy Transfer broke up, Tulsa, Oklahoma-based Williams has laid out plans to move forward as a stand-alone company while investing more than $1.5 billion in its master limited partnership, Williams Partners LP (WPZ.N). Williams and Williams Partners have taken steps to sell assets to reduce their debt loads. Shares of Williams rose as much 11 percent after Reuters was first to report on Enterprise's approach and ended trading on Thursday up 7.8 percent at $28.11. Enterprise shares closed down 2 percent at $27.02, giving the company a market capitalization of $57 billion. A Delaware judge ruled in June that Energy Transfer could terminate its deal to buy Williams over tax issues. The deal had been in doubt for months, with Williams suing Energy Transfer, accusing the company of breaching the terms of their merger in trying to back out.Energy Transfer had become unhappy with the deal as oil's prolonged downturn put many of its and Williams' customers - major oil and gas producers - in jeopardy, driving down the value of both companies. Energy Transfer pushed for a breakup of the deal even as oil prices climbed back, troubled by the debt it would need to incur  to fund the cash portion of its bid.

90,"  Canada's Enbridge Inc said on Tuesday it would buy Spectra Energy Corp of Houston in an all-stock deal valued at about $28 billion (C$37 billion) to create the largest North American energy infrastructure company.The takeover, the most significant energy deal since oil and natural gas prices crashed in mid-2014, highlights how pipeline companies are under pressure to merge as they grapple with overcapacity and sliding tariffs that have slowed dividend growth and unnerved investors.Enbridge's biggest-ever deal will consolidate its leading position next to U.S. transport giants Kinder Morgan Inc  and Plains All American Pipeline LP, which have seen their stock prices sink over the last two years as oil and gas producers slash spending on new wells.Enbridge's pipelines mainly send Canadian oil sands to refiners on the U.S. Gulf Coast, while Spectra's network ships natural gas to the U.S. East Coast.The deal has no serious antitrust problems as the companies' networks have ""limited overlap,"" said Bruce McDonald, an antitrust expert with Jones Day law firm.The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission did not comment.Spectra shares leapt 13 percent to $40.89, their biggest jump in more than three years. Despite having risen some 50 percent since January on a partial recovery in oil and gas prices, Spectra's shares are still down 16 percent from a high of $43 hit in July 2014.Enbridge's U.S.-listed shares rose 4.3 percent to $42.77 and its Toronto-listed shares bounced. Under the terms of the deal, Spectra shareholders will get 0.984 shares of the combined company for each share held. This is equal to $40.33 per share, representing a premium of about 11.5 percent to Spectra's closing price on Friday.That premium was small compared to the 32.4-percent premium Energy Transfer offered for Williams Companies Inc  in a 2015 deal that ultimately failed.The Enbridge-Spectra deal has an enterprise value of $127 billion, the companies said. Enbridge will issue about 694 million new shares and take on about $22 billion of Spectra debt. Enbridge also said it planned to divest about $2 billion of non-core assets over the next year.Enbridge Chief Executive Al Monaco will lead the combined company, which will be headquartered in Calgary. Greg Ebel, Spectra's CEO, will be non-executive chairman. ""Over the last two years, we've been focused on identifying opportunities that would extend and diversify our asset base and sources of growth beyond 2019,"" Monaco said in a statement.After the close of the deal, Enbridge shareholders will own about 57 percent of the combined company, which is expected to deliver annual savings of C$540 million, most of which are expected to be achieved in late 2018.MORE DEALS  Despite lots of talk about an M&A wave, only a handful of energy acquisitions have happened since oil and gas prices entered their worst slump in a generation as buyers and sellers have been unable to agree on prices.But now more deals are starting to get done.On Tuesday, EOG Resources Inc, a leading U.S. shale oil producer, said it would buy privately held Yates Petroleum Corp, which has assets in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, for $2.5 billion.TransCanada Corp, Canada's second-largest pipeline operator, completed its $10.2 billion takeover of Columbia Pipeline Group in July.Enbridge bought a minority stake in the Bakken Pipeline last month.
