0,"   By Piya Sinha-Roy | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Jan 14 MTV is harnessing its roots in the pop music world to showcase a crop of rising artists with its annual 'Artists to Watch' campaign, selecting acts from across the world to bring to its  youth audience.British alt-pop band Bastille, Scottish electro-pop group Chvrches and girl group Fifth Harmony are three of 12 up-and-coming acts chosen by MTV as ones to watch.The 'Artists to Watch' program helps expose rising stars in the music world to MTV's target audience, and is an evolution of the network's early intentions to showcase artists making waves in the pop music zeitgeist.""Music videos are still an important part of a music experience, but it's not everything,"" Amy Doyle, MTV's executive vice president of music and talent programming, told Reuters.""We really took the cue from the audience and they don't want just music videos. They really want to get to know the artist through their interviews and live performances,"" Doyle added.Bastille and Chvrches have both been gaining prominence in the United States through live performances and radio play, while Fifth Harmony, formed on U.S. reality TV talent competition ""The X Factor,"" have found an audience through the show's fan base. MTV's 'Artists to Watch' campaign selects 12 up-and-coming acts spanning all popular music genres from across the world, and gives each act a two-week slot in which the artist or band is showcased across all of the network's music TV channels and online, mobile and social media platforms. Each act will also have a chance to perform at MTV's annual televised Movie Awards and Video Music Awards.The Viacom-owned youth entertainment network has a good track record of showcasing artists on the brink of success, including teen YouTube sensation Justin Bieber, R&B singer Miguel and indie-pop singer Lana Del Rey in recent years.In 2013, MTV picked New Zealand alt-pop singer Lorde and Seattle rapper-producer duo Macklemore & Ryan Lewis as artists to watch, and both acts landed multiple Grammy nominations.This year's roster includes Detroit rapper Danny Brown, Chicago hip hop artist Vic Mensa, Dutch electronic dance music (EDM) DJ Martin Garrix, British pop group Rixton, Los Angeles soul singer Jhene Aiko, alt-pop group Echosmith and Australian EDM DJ Flume. The campaign will kick off on Jan. 23 at famed Hollywood music venue House of Blues, showcasing the rising acts ahead of the Grammy awards, when the music industry will flock to Los Angeles for music's biggest night on Jan. 26.FROM DIGITAL PLATFORMS TO TV SCREENS  Other 2014 ""artists to watch"" have been mined from the online world where they have grown a fan base through YouTube and social media platforms.Singer-songwriter Tori Kelly, 21, has garnered more than 60 million views on her YouTube channel including 2 million views of her debut ""Dear No One"" music video, and hip hop artist Jake Miller, also 21, has racked up more than 25 million views on his YouTube platform.But while aspiring singers have been able to build a fan base through digital media platforms, MTV's added TV exposure is part of the benefit of being selected as an artist to watch.""The campaign is exposure to people that you wouldn't normally reach, it's people watching TV and the Internet,"" said Allison Kaye, general manager of SB Projects LLC, the company headed by Scooter Braun, who discovered Bieber on YouTube and became his manager.Braun and his team represent Kelly, Rixton and Garrix.""Knowing that MTV is behind an act is so important to us and the artist. It helps artists reach people,"" Kaye added.",2014-01-14,VIAB,"Tue Jan 14, 2014 | 6:00am EST","MTV showcases 2014 'Artists to Watch' across TV, digital platforms",http://www.reuters.com//article/music-mtv-artiststowatch-idUSL2N0KO09320140114?type=companyNews
1,"  (Corrects third par to remove incorrect statement  that Viacom did not include CoC in deal last August)By Danielle RobinsonNEW YORK, March 4 (IFR) - Six of the eight investment-grade corporate bonds that priced Tuesday included change-of-control (CoC) language, as wary investors demand more protection after some recent close calls.Rattled by Safeway Inc's decision to sell itself - and the spectre of Time Warner Cable nearly tumbling into junk status - bond investors are pushing for more CoC clauses.Entertainment giant Viacom included a CoC in its deal, as did Gilead Sciences, Potash Corp of Saskatchewan, Aetna, Pitney Bowes and Burlington Northern Santa Fe.Air Lease Corp, in the financial sector, also included CoC language. Although CoC language is common enough in the investment-grade market, it's not often that virtually all of the corporate deals on a single day have included it.Investors were shocked to see how close Time Warner Cable - with roughly US$24bn of outstanding debt, none of it with CoC language - came to being bought by junk-rated Charter Communications. ""Time Warner really increased investors' concern about the event risk in the investment grade market so now the first thing you look at in a new issue is whether it has CoC protection,"" Rajeev Sharma, portfolio manager at First Investors Management Co, told IFR.Companies which can still add debt without piercing their leverage targets are the most obvious candidates for CoC language""Looking at recent bond issues, investors have asked for CoC language in deals from companies that have leveragable balance sheets, which makes them attractive targets for private equity,"" said one senior credit strategist. Demand for CoC is also required for certain corporates that are rated single A by one agency - such as the trades today from Potash (A3/A-) and Gilead (Baa1/A-).Some investors demand payment of as much as 20bp more in new issue premium if a bond doesn't have CoC language.""We've historically avoided deals without that language unless the spreads were really compelling,"" said a senior portfolio manager.""So much so that [the issuers] adequately compensated us for the absence of that language.""

MTV, which is owned by Viacom Inc, said the show will also feature unseen clips from upcoming summer films. O'Brien, the host of late-night talk show ""Conan"" on cable network TBS, is known for his oddball, youth-skewed humor, which marked a generational shift when he began a 16-year stint on NBC's ""Late Night"" talk show in 1993. The MTV Movie Awards offers a cheeky take on Hollywood's usual black-tie and gown awards season by handing out golden, popcorn-shaped trophies in categories like ""best villain"" and ""best gut-wrenching performance.""The awards categories bestow honors to the year's blockbuster hits likely to have been overlooked by industry stalwarts the Oscars and the Golden Globes.

Time Warner's  HBO and CBS both announced video streaming initiatives last fall. These offerings underscore a shifting landscape in the television ecosystem as more people ditch pricey cable subscriptions in favor of video streaming products offered by Netflix, Amazon and Hulu.The news came as Viacom, owner of movie studio Paramount Pictures and cable networks MTV and Comedy Central, reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue due to weak advertising spending in the United States.Viacom said domestic ad revenue fell 6 percent on lower ratings, especially at its cable networks MTV and VHI. Viacom has been plagued by weak ratings and Dauman said on the call that the company is considering other options to measure its viewership, which he feels does not accurately capture people watching its TV programs on various devices.Nielsen has long dominated TV ratings, which are considered the currency used to determine ad rates for commercials. ""We are working with other major parties in the advertising ecosystem, bringing together data scientists and industry experts, whether at Nielsen or elsewhere, to create new measurement and monetization tools,"" Dauman said.Total revenue for the first quarter ending Dec. 31 rose 4.4 percent to $3.34 billion, below analysts expectations of $3.41 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to     Viacom fell to $500 million, or $1.20 per share, from $547 million, or $1.20 per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, the company earned $1.29 per share, above the $1.28 per share analysts forecast.Shares of the company were nearly unchanged at $66.36 in late morning trading on Thursday.

18,"  U.S. media company Viacom Inc (VIAB.O) said it will undertake a restructuring, including cutting jobs, abandoning some acquired titles and reorganizing three of its domestic network groups into two new organizations, to drive growth.The owner of movie studio Paramount Pictures and cable networks such as MTV and Comedy Central said it will take a related pre-tax charge of about $785 million in the quarter ended March 31.Viacom also halted its $20 billion share buyback program due to the restructuring and the spending on acquisitions anticipated in the current fiscal year.The company's shares fell 1.6 percent after the bell on Monday.Viacom said the new structure would realign sales, marketing, creative and support functions and increase efficiencies in program and product development. The company in January reported lower-than-expected first-quarter revenue due to weak advertising spending in the United States.Analysts on average were expecting the company to post a profit of $428.3 million on revenue of $3.26 billion in the second quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Viacom said on Monday it ""reallocating resources to expand its capabilities in critical business areas"" such as data analysis, technology development and consumer insights.The company said it expects to save about $350 million annually, including about $175 million this year, from the restructuring. Viacom said the stock buyback halt, aimed to keep the company within its target leverage ratio, would last no later than October. Up to Monday's close, shares of the company have slipped about 9 percent this year.

20,"  April 7 Shares of MTV owner Viacom Inc  slipped on Tuesday, a day after the company hit the pause button on a $20 billion share buyback program and announced slew of restructuring steps that will result in a charge of $785 million.Viacom, which also owns movie studio Paramount Pictures and the Comedy Central cable channel, foreshadowed earlier this year its plans to restructure in the face of falling cable ratings.Viacom is struggling to adjust to shifting viewing habits as people ditch pricey cable subscriptions in favor of video streaming products offered by companies such as Netflix Inc , Amazon.com Inc and Hulu.But the extent of the reorganization took the market by surprise, and the company's shares fell as much as 2.3 percent.Analysts at Wunderlich Securities said they had expected the charges - related to job cuts and reorganizing three of Viacom's domestic network groups into two - to total about $550 million. ""While we'd argue the long term benefits of cost savings trump the delay of roughly $1 billion in stock repurchases, we expect a negative reaction from the market,"" Jefferies analysts wrote in a client note.However, they said the worst was probably behind the stock. Viacom has been plagued by weak ratings since early 2014, although the company has said the figures do not accurately capture viewership of its TV programs watched on other devices.Chief Executive Philippe Dauman said in January that Viacom planned to introduce an online video streaming product for its children's cable network, Nickelodeon, jumping on the direct-to-consumer bandwagon. Time Warner Inc's HBO and CBS Corp announced video streaming initiatives last fall. Analysts at Nomura Securities were cautious about the company's prospects.""...Until a tangible TV ratings recovery takes place, it will be difficult to endorse Viacom's content, which has recently lost key personalities Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert,"" the analysts wrote in a note.Voting control of Viacom is held by National Amusements Inc, a private company controlled by billionaire Sumner Redstone.The company's shares were down 1.9 percent at $67.31 in early afternoon trading on the Nasdaq. Up to Monday's close, the stock had fallen 8.8 percent this year.

26,"   By Tim McLaughlin and David Randall  Aug 6 U.S. media stocks have taken an indiscriminate beating this week, but many big fund managers still like entertainment conglomerate Walt Disney Co  while turning negative for the long term on Discovery Communications, owner of several niche television franchises.Shares of leading media stocks slid again on Thursday as investors sorted winners and losers. Television advertising has been drying up as consumers downsize or eliminate expensive cable TV packages and watch more programs on mobile devices.The stock decline, fanned by a slew of disappointing financial reports, hurt a number of U.S. funds this week. Portfolio manager Don Yacktman has seen the performance of both his $11.2 billion Yacktman Fund and the $7.6 billion Yacktman Focused fund tumble into the 98th percentile of their Morningstar peers.Along with 7.7 million shares of Viacom Inc spread between those two funds, Yacktman owns about 30 million shares of Twenty-First Century Fox, down about 22 percent for the year. Viacom is off 22 percent this week and down nearly 45 percent over the past 12 months. Yacktman did not respond to a request for comment. Shares of Disney are off nearly 10 percent this week amid concerns that its leading sports channel franchise ESPN is losing subscribers. Disney Chairman and Chief Executive Jeff Iger admitted to ""modest losses"" during a conference call with analysts and investors this week. But he said cable packages are not dead and ESPN will still be the centerpiece of any offering.Pound for pound, the $866 million Fidelity Select Multimedia Portfolio has one of the biggest bets on Disney's future, with 24 percent of its assets in the stock at the end of June, fund disclosures show.As a result, the fund is down 4.2 percent this week, underperforming nearly all of its peers, according to Morningstar Inc. But thanks in part to Disney, the fund's three-year average annual total return of 21.76 percent is better than 83 percent of peers. Portfolio manager Nidhi Gupta was not available for comment, but earlier this year declared Disney the ""clear winner among the content providers.""Like many other fund managers, Gupta has soured on Discovery Communications, hard hit by the consumer shift to watching Internet-based content. Discovery shares are down 7 percent this week and down 29 percent over the past 12 months. Fund managers began unloading large blocks of Discovery early last year. Fidelity's behemoth Contrafund had a $1 billion stake in Discovery in early 2014. By the end of the year, Will Danoff, manager of the $113 billion fund, had eliminated his position in Discovery, citing disappointing earnings.By contrast, Danoff's stake in Disney, $2.6 billion at the end of June, has grown to about 2.3 percent of Contrafund's portfolio, up from 1.87 percent in early 2014, fund disclosures show.(Reporting by Tim McLaughlin in Boston and David Randall in New York; Editing by David Gregorio)",2015-08-06,VIAB,"Thu Aug 6, 2015 | 4:57pm EDT","Despite media stock beat down, Disney stands tall with U.S. funds",http://www.reuters.com//article/media-funds-disney-idUSL1N10H34C20150806?type=companyNews

Shares of Disney, Fox, Discovery and Time Warner also fell for the second straight day. Concerns over viewers cutting the cord on cable TV and moving online increased on Tuesday when Disney lowered its profit forecast for its cable business.Viacom's advertising revenue fell 9 percent in its U.S. cable business, the fourth straight quarter of decline.The company has been hurt by lower Nielsen ratings for some of its shows. Nielsen ratings, based on feedback from viewers, have long been the metric advertisers use to negotiate TV ad rates and make their decisions. Viacom says that Nielsen ratings do not adequately reflect its viewership as viewers are shifting to digital platforms such as tablets and smartphones for their entertainment fix.Revenue from Viacom's movie studio business, which includes Paramount Pictures Corp, fell 44 percent to $479 million. The company had benefited in the year-earlier quarter from the release of its blockbuster ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"".Viacom's movie slate for the fourth quarter includes ""Terminator: Genisys"" and ""Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation"", which are expected to drive revenue.

40,"   By Jessica Toonkel and Abhirup Roy  Viacom Inc (VIAB.O), the owner of MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon, reported weaker-than-expected quarterly revenue on Thursday, although declines in ad sales for its U.S. cable TV business were not as steep as analysts had anticipated. Chief Executive Officer Philippe Dauman told analysts on a conference call that he expected U.S. ad sales to continue to improve this quarter. Viacom shares rose nearly 3 percent.The revenue miss was largely due to a lack of hit releases from the company's Paramount film studio. Domestic advertising revenue fell 7 percent in the fourth quarter ended on Sept. 30, while analysts had expected an 8.4 percent drop.The cable industry faces an increasing threat to revenue as consumers switch to streaming services such as Netflix (NFLX.O) and Hulu, a trend known as ""cord-cutting.""Viacom has also been facing questions about a successor to 91-year-old Chairman Sumner Redstone, who controls about 80 percent of the voting shares in the company. There was no mention of a succession plan on the call.  In addition, the media company has suffered from weak ratings at a number of its networks.However, the company's Vantage data product, which helps companies provide more targeted television ads, is drawing growing interest, Dauman said. Viacom has 11 major advertisers using Vantage, which it introduced in April, and expects to have 33 by May. Filmed entertainment revenue dropped 24 percent to $1.03 billion, short of the $1.16 billion average estimate of analysts surveyed by FactSet StreetAccount. ""Terminator: Genisys"" grossed about $441 million worldwide, while ""Mission: Impossible-Rogue Nation"" generated about $682 million, according to Box Office Mojo.But a year earlier, ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" alone grossed $1.10 billion worldwide.Revenue from the company's media networks business, including its cable interests, rose 5 percent, helped by a rise in international ad sales, especially in Europe. But total revenue dropped 5 percent to $3.79 billion, missing the analysts' average estimate of $3.88 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net income from continuing operations attributable to Viacom rose to $884 million, or $2.21 per share, from $732 million, or $1.72 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected $1.55 per share.Shares of Viacom, which had fallen about 35 percent this year, were up 2.6 percent at $50.64 in afternoon trading.

44,"  LOS ANGELES Nov 30 A California court on Monday rejected a request from the former girlfriend of Sumner Redstone for the 92-year-old media mogul, who controls CBS Corp  and Viacom Inc, to undergo an immediate medical evaluation.Former girlfriend Manuela Herzer filed a lawsuit last week seeking to have Redstone declared mentally incompetent and sought to have him examined to determine if he can still make decisions for himself.Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Clifford Klein ruled there was no need for an immediate evaluation. ""I do not find any urgency,"" Klein said at a hearing in Los Angeles Superior Court.The judge cited four reasons in his decision: Redstone sees a personal physician regularly, is not suffering from any critical health condition, has full-time care and has a health agent who is an attorney and chief executive of Viacom. Herzer had been chosen by Redstone to make healthcare decisions for him in case he was not able to, her lawsuit said, until Redstone executed a new agreement on Oct. 16 to remove her as his health care agent in favor of Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman. Herzer claims that Redstone was mentally incompetent when he removed her as his health care agent in October and asks that she be reinstated as the person in charge of his medical decisions if he becomes incapacitated.A hearing will be held in January on a motion from Redstone's attorneys to dismiss the case.

45,"   By Jennifer Saba  The court filings submitted by Manuela Herzer, who was thrown out of Redstone's house earlier this year, allege that he can no longer make decisions for himself. His attorneys reject the claims and say Redstone continues to oversee his own well-being.It probably won't curtail the suspicions. Redstone public interviews have been few and far between. There has been no sign of him on company earnings calls for a while, where he once famously heaped praise on his chief executives. He also didn't turn up for Viacom's annual shareholder meeting in March or one held by CBS in May.Viacom, home to cable network MTV and movie studio Paramount, and CBS - with a combined market value of $45 billion - routinely have been pilloried by proxy advisers for governance risks associated with their board compositions and dual-class share structures. The handling of Redstone's health only makes matters worse. While one of Redstone's estate planners told the Wall Street Journal that an independent physician confirmed his capacity in September, the companies themselves have been less forthcoming on any details.The danger is that a court steps in, as happened with Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling, whose wife sold the team after a judge ruled him mentally incapacitated. In such an eventuality, a potential power struggle between Redstone's daughter, Shari, who is vice chairwoman at both CBS and Viacom, and Dauman, one of Redstone's trustees, could roil the companies and the stocks. Balancing respect and privacy for an aging man and the needs of investors isn't always easy. Warren Buffett, for one, came clean about his cancer diagnosis and prognosis in 2012, when he was 82. It's time for Redstone and his boards to do the same. CONTEXT NEWS - A former girlfriend of Sumner Redstone, the 92-year-old executive chairman of CBS and Viacom, filed court documents on Nov. 25 claiming that Redstone was incapable of managing his health. - Attorneys for Redstone filed opposition papers to claims by Manuela Herzer stating that Redstone ""continues to make his own health care decisions,"" and has appointed Philippe Dauman, the chief executive of Viacom, to act in the event of his incapacity.- Redstone controls Viacom and CBS through National Amusements, which holds 80 percent of the voting stock in both media companies.(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

Klein put a hold on discovery in the case, saying the request from Herzer's attorneys was too broad.Herzer's lawyers have asked for a videotaped deposition of Redstone. At the hearing, Gabrielle Vidal, an attorney for Redstone, said that request was premature, as the court has not yet ruled on the motion to dismiss the case.Pierce O'Donnell, a lawyer for Herzer, said after the hearing that he expected to win the right for the deposition.

47,"   By Jessica Toonkel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Two of the largest shareholders in Viacom Inc (VIAB.O) have made the highly unusual move of publicly questioning Sumner Redstone's mental fitness to remain executive chairman of the multi-billion dollar media company.Mario Gabelli, whose funds hold the second-largest voting stake in Viacom after Redstone himself, and Salvatore Muoio, whose firm is the seventh-biggest voting shareholder, voiced the concerns a week after a former girlfriend of Redstone filed a lawsuit alleging that the 92-year-old mogul was mentally incompetent.A member of Viacom's board made the rare move of responding publicly on Tuesday to investors' concerns, saying Redstone remains ""mentally capable.""The investors' expressions of doubt about the mental competence of a high-profile company executive came as a surprise, but gossip column reports and heavy secrecy around the health of the media mogul have led to intense speculation over the future of Redstone and his $45 billion media empire.Redstone has not been involved in the day-to-day management of the company for some time, but the lawsuit by ex-girlfriend Manuela Herzer, who has petitioned the court for an examination of Redstone, has caused some to worry that a surge of litigation could hamper the company as it tries to recover from a drop in TV ratings.Herzer filed the lawsuit Nov. 25, weeks after being kicked out of Redstone's Los Angeles-area home. Redstone had designated her as his agent to make health care decisions if he was unable to do so, and in October Redstone replaced her with Viacom Chief Executive Philippe Dauman.Herzer claims that Redstone was mentally incapable of making that decision and asked the court to reinstate her.Redstone's lawyer, Gabrielle Vidal, had said the lawsuit was baseless and that Herzer is financially motivated. Viacom's board denied any issues with Redstone's mental fitness on Tuesday.“As has been widely and publicly disclosed, Mr. Redstone’s physicians have publicly attested that he is mentally capable, and this information is consistent with other medical and other information available to me,"" William Schwartz, chairman of Viacom’s governance and nominating committee, said in an emailed statement.The suit highlighted the uncertainty over what will happen on the death of Redstone, who controls about 80 percent of both Viacom and CBS and is executive chairman of both companies.""Is he or isn't he in the position where he should be chairman emeritus or something?"" Gabelli, chief executive officer of Rye, New York-based GAMCO Investors Inc, told Reuters. He left a message for a person at Viacom about the issue on Tuesday, he said, declining to say whom he called. Muoio, a principal with New York-based S. Muoio & Co, said he had similar issues.  ""If Sumner is no longer fit to lead the board, then he should give up that role,"" Muoio told Reuters.CBS and Viacom, home to cable networks MTV and Nickelodeon, have a combined market value of $45 billion. Redstone controls both companies through his vehicle National Amusements which holds 80 percent of the voting stock. As chairman and owner, he has the ultimate say over major decisions involving CBS and Viacom, including any potential merger deals. If CBS or Viacom did remove Redstone as executive chairman, it is unclear who would replace him. Upon Redstone's death, a trust of seven people, including daughter Shari Redstone and Viacom CEO Dauman, will oversee his voting stake.Redstone has not been on an earnings call since last year and did not turn up for Viacom’s annual shareholder meeting in March or one held by CBS in May. ""Too many people are calling me and saying: 'What's really going on?',"" Gabelli told Reuters.Gabelli also tweeted about the issue on Tuesday afternoon, writing that Viacom should ""give to all shareholders what the Board of Directors know about Executive Chair.""Even investors who are less concerned about Redstone's title are worried about the attention the suit is getting.""I don't think the company is rudderless because Redstone is in ill health, but I do think the issue has created more noise lately because of the lawsuit,"" said Michael Cuggino, president and portfolio manager at San Francisco-based Permanent Portfolio of Family Of Funds, which is the fifth-largest voting shareholder in Viacom.As an example, Cuggino said a copy of Redstone's signature from one of the filings in Herzer's lawsuit looking like a line going off the page had been widely seen.Viacom shares closed down 4.1 percent at $47.65 on Nasdaq.

50,"   By Jessica Toonkel  Mario Gabelli, the second-largest voting shareholder in Viacom Inc, is calling for the media company to disclose the mental competence of its executive chairman, Sumner Redstone, the billionaire value investor said on Wednesday.The inquiries came a week after Redstone's former girlfriend, Manuela Herzer, filed a lawsuit seeking to have Redstone declared mentally incompetent and petitioning to have him examined to see if he can still make decisions for himself. She filed the lawsuit weeks after being kicked out of Redstone's Los Angeles area home.Gabelli left a message for someone at Viacom about the issue on Tuesday, he told Reuters, declining to say whom he called. He had not heard back as of Wednesday morning. A Viacom spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Gabelli, who read Herzer's petition, said the lawsuit itself did not concern him, but the press around it did. ""Too many people are calling me and saying: 'What's really going on?'"" Gabelli said. ""It would be appropriate for a company trading on the New York Stock Exchange to basically make a statement with some kind of veracity ... Is he or isn't he in the position where he should be chairman emeritus or something?"" Gabelli also tweeted about the issue on Tuesday afternoon, writing that Viacom should ""give to all shareholders what the Board of Directors know about Executive Chair.""Redstone's lawyer, Gabrielle Vidal, had said the lawsuit was baseless.Viacom shares were down 3 percent at $48.21 in midday trading.",2015-12-02,VIAB,"Wed Dec 2, 2015 | 12:52pm EST",Shareholder Gabelli calls for disclosure around Redstone's mental capacity,http://www.reuters.com//article/redstone-lawsuit-gabelli-idUSL1N13R1YY20151202?type=companyNews

Asked about its share structure, Viacom spokesman Jeremy Zweig said via email that ""we believe that it has contributed, and continues to contribute, to our stability and long-term stockholder returns.""He added that it ""allows investors an opportunity to participate financially in companies in which the existing owners may not wish to part with voting control.""

The lack of voting rights for many investors means Viacom's board is insulated from investor pressure, she said.The company has faced criticism from corporate governance advisers over its high pay for executives, but Mastagni said there is little investors can do.""This is an example, putting Mr. Redstone aside, where the minority shareholders have no way to hold the board accountable,"" she said.

55,"   By Jessica Toonkel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Two of the largest shareholders in Viacom Inc (VIAB.O) have made the highly unusual move of publicly questioning Sumner Redstone's mental fitness to remain executive chairman of the multi-billion dollar media company.Mario Gabelli, whose funds hold the second-largest voting stake in Viacom after Redstone himself, and Salvatore Muoio, whose firm is the seventh-biggest voting shareholder, voiced the concerns a week after a former girlfriend of Redstone filed a lawsuit alleging that the 92-year-old mogul was mentally incompetent.A member of Viacom's board made the rare move of responding publicly on Tuesday to investors' concerns, saying Redstone remains ""mentally capable.""The investors' expressions of doubt about the mental competence of a high-profile company executive came as a surprise, but gossip column reports and heavy secrecy around the health of the media mogul have led to intense speculation over the future of Redstone and his $45 billion media empire.Redstone has not been involved in the day-to-day management of the company for some time, but the lawsuit by ex-girlfriend Manuela Herzer, who has petitioned the court for an examination of Redstone, has caused some to worry that a surge of litigation could hamper the company as it tries to recover from a drop in TV ratings.Herzer filed the lawsuit Nov. 25, weeks after being kicked out of Redstone's Los Angeles-area home. Redstone had designated her as his agent to make health care decisions if he was unable to do so, and in October Redstone replaced her with Viacom Chief Executive Philippe Dauman.Herzer claims that Redstone was mentally incapable of making that decision and asked the court to reinstate her.Redstone's lawyer, Gabrielle Vidal, had said the lawsuit was baseless and that Herzer is financially motivated. Viacom's board denied any issues with Redstone's mental fitness on Tuesday.“As has been widely and publicly disclosed, Mr. Redstone’s physicians have publicly attested that he is mentally capable, and this information is consistent with other medical and other information available to me,"" William Schwartz, chairman of Viacom’s governance and nominating committee, said in an emailed statement.The suit highlighted the uncertainty over what will happen on the death of Redstone, who controls about 80 percent of both Viacom and CBS and is executive chairman of both companies.""Is he or isn't he in the position where he should be chairman emeritus or something?"" Gabelli, chief executive officer of Rye, New York-based GAMCO Investors Inc, told Reuters. He left a message for a person at Viacom about the issue on Tuesday, he said, declining to say whom he called. Muoio, a principal with New York-based S. Muoio & Co, said he had similar issues.  ""If Sumner is no longer fit to lead the board, then he should give up that role,"" Muoio told Reuters.CBS and Viacom, home to cable networks MTV and Nickelodeon, have a combined market value of $45 billion. Redstone controls both companies through his vehicle National Amusements which holds 80 percent of the voting stock. As chairman and owner, he has the ultimate say over major decisions involving CBS and Viacom, including any potential merger deals. If CBS or Viacom did remove Redstone as executive chairman, it is unclear who would replace him. Upon Redstone's death, a trust of seven people, including daughter Shari Redstone and Viacom CEO Dauman, will oversee his voting stake.Redstone has not been on an earnings call since last year and did not turn up for Viacom’s annual shareholder meeting in March or one held by CBS in May. ""Too many people are calling me and saying: 'What's really going on?',"" Gabelli told Reuters.Gabelli also tweeted about the issue on Tuesday afternoon, writing that Viacom should ""give to all shareholders what the Board of Directors know about Executive Chair.""Even investors who are less concerned about Redstone's title are worried about the attention the suit is getting.""I don't think the company is rudderless because Redstone is in ill health, but I do think the issue has created more noise lately because of the lawsuit,"" said Michael Cuggino, president and portfolio manager at San Francisco-based Permanent Portfolio of Family Of Funds, which is the fifth-largest voting shareholder in Viacom.As an example, Cuggino said a copy of Redstone's signature from one of the filings in Herzer's lawsuit looking like a line going off the page had been widely seen.Viacom shares closed down 4.1 percent at $47.65 on Nasdaq.

60,"   By Jessica Toonkel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Viacom Inc's Chief Operating Officer, Thomas Dooley, has not renewed an employment agreement set to expire in 12 months, a situation that compensation consultants say is unusual and raises the question of whether he will stay with the multi-billion dollar media company as it tries to turn its fortunes around.The uncertainty could further unsettle investors who have  already confronted the company about the health of Viacom's 92-year old controlling investor and Executive Chairman Sumner Redstone.The fact that the number-two executive has not renewed his employment contract, which is set to expire in December 2016, is notable because of his close association with Viacom Chief Executive Officer Philippe Dauman, whom he has worked with for more than half his life. Dauman renewed his contract in January through 2018.  Dooley said he has no plans to leave the company.“It’s a pleasure and a privilege to work at Viacom by Philippe’s side,"" Dooley told Reuters in an email. ""There is no one who loves this company and its people more than me and I have no plans to go anywhere.”Viacom, for its part, declined to comment on negotiations.“Mr. Dooley has more than a year remaining under his current contract,"" a Viacom spokesman told Reuters in an email. ""Tom is a valued leader and, while we can’t comment on specific negotiations about any executive, we will address the extension of his contract in due course.” Questions about Dooley's fate could increase uncertainty about Viacom at a time when the Nickelodeon and MTV operator is attempting to recover from a slide in ratings. The changing habits of TV viewers, ditching pricey cable subscriptions in favor of a la carte options, is casting a shadow over the company. Viacom's stock is down 44 percent this year.Typically, large publicly traded companies lock in key executives' contracts at least a year ahead of expiration, said Alan Johnson, a New York-based executive compensation consultant.""Particularly with the uncertainty around Viacom, if you really want to keep him you would want to get his contract done sooner rather than later,"" Johnson said. ""It is one more thing to create uncertainty and agita for Viacom,"" he added.Viacom Chief Financial Officer Wade Davis has also renewed his agreement through 2018. Davis' contract was set to expire in November of this year.  To be sure, Dooley still has time to renew. But media companies generally want to have their top executives' agreements locked in within 12 to 18 months of their expiration, said Gavin McElroy, an employment and compensation specialist at law firm Frankfurt Kurnit Klein & Selz. In the absence of a contract renewal, ""the concern is that the executive's lame duck status could adversely affect people reporting to him,"" said McElroy. Also, third parties might worry that if he advocated for a deal, ""he might not be there to push it through.""Viacom has already been confronted by investors asking for more information about Redstone's health following a lawsuit filed in November by Redstone's former girlfriend, Manuela Herzer, who petitioned the court for an examination of Redstone's mental competence. Last week, Viacom's second-biggest shareholder, Mario Gabelli, called for the company to disclose Redstone's condition and whether he is fit to run his $45 billion media empire which is made up of Viacom and CBS.Redstone controls both companies through National Amusements, which holds about 80 percent of the voting stock of each company, but his presence as a hands-on chairman has faded over the years and he has not spoken on a company earnings call this year. Dauman said on Monday he speaks to Redstone several times a week. Dooley and Dauman have worked closely for over 30 years. They left Viacom together in 2000 when Viacom merged with CBS to run DND Capital Partners, a private equity firm specializing in media and telecommunications. Six years later, when Viacom spun off CBS, Dauman and Dooley returned to Viacom, with Dauman as CEO and Dooley as chief administrative officer. He was promoted to CFO in 2007, and to COO in 2010.Over the past four years, Dooley has made more than $124 million, according to company filings.

70,"  (Repeats with no change to text)By Lisa RichwineJan 4 Lawyers for media mogul Sumner Redstone on Monday asked a court to dismiss ex-girlfriend Manuela Herzer's petition for a new evaluation of the 92-year-old's mental competence, while Herzer's attorneys said they will seek a subpoena of Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman to compel his testimony in the case.Investors are closely following the lawsuit, which has raised concerns about whether Redstone is capable of continuing as executive chairman of Viacom and CBS Corp.The motion filed on behalf of billionaire Redstone on Monday said he need not be examined since his own physician concluded that he was making healthcare decisions for himself. Redstone's lawyers argued that the court proceeding does not appear reasonably necessary to protect Redstone's interests and called it ""abusive."" Dr. Richard Gold, Redstone's primary treating physician, said in documents submitted to the court that he saw Redstone as recently as December 30 and the visit was ""routine."" ""Mr. Redstone seemed his usual self, and joked with me,"" he said.A brain scan in November ""was quite good for a 92-year-old,"" Gold said. Herzer petitioned in November to have Redstone examined to see if he was able to make decisions for himself. Weeks earlier, Herzer had been told to leave Redstone's Los Angeles home and was replaced by Dauman as Redstone's healthcare agent.On Monday, an attorney for Herzer, Pierce O'Donnell, said he would ask the court to subpoena Dauman to compel him to take part in a deposition. O'Donnell said in a statement that his firm had requested a deposition but Dauman's attorneys refused to set a date. In a declaration to the court in November, Dauman said Redstone was ""engaged and attentive"" in recent conversations. No declaration from Dauman was included with Monday's motion.In previous court documents, Herzer has described Redstone as mentally vacant, ""listless"" and prone to uncontrollable crying spells.Redstone controls about 80 percent of the voting shares in CBS and Viacom through a holding company.Herzer had been chosen by Redstone to make healthcare decisions for him in case he was not able to, her lawsuit says, until Redstone executed a new agreement on Oct. 16 to remove Herzer as his health care agent.

76,"   By Dan Levine and Lisa Richwine  Viacom Inc's 92-year-old Executive Chairman Sumner Redstone should be examined by a psychiatrist hired by the ex-girlfriend who has questioned his mental competency, a California judge ruled on Friday.The decision may provide investors with new information about Redstone's capabilities. He controls Viacom and CBS Corp, although his role at the companies has grown less visible.Viacom cut Redstone's pay 85 percent to $2 million last year, the company said in a securities filing on Friday, citing ""reduced responsibilities,""Geriatric psychiatrist Stephen Read will conduct the court-ordered mental examination within the next 10 days, said Pierce O'Donnell, an attorney for Redstone's former girlfriend Manuela Herzer.Redstone’s attorneys have not indicated whether they will appeal, a development that could affect the schedule. They have argued that Herzer has filed the suit for financial gain.Read may interview Redstone for up to an hour, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge David Cowan said in his ruling. Redstone's attorneys acknowledge he has a speech impairment, and Cowan wrote that the executive's nurses and speech therapists may be present during the exam.Herzer and her attorneys cannot be present. Herzer's lawsuit filed in November said that Redstone had chosen her to make healthcare decisions for him in case he was not able to. It claimed the billionaire was mentally incompetent when he replaced her as his designated healthcare agent on Oct. 16 with Viacom Chief Executive Philippe Dauman.Read, in a declaration filed in November on behalf of Herzer, said he believed Redstone lacked the mental capacity to make that change. He cited testimony from Herzer and other witnesses but he had not examined Redstone in person.Redstone's primary physician, Dr. Richard Gold, told the court Redstone was fully aware of what he was doing at the time.Gold was deposed by Herzer's attorneys this month. The judge said in his ruling called Gold's deposition testimony ""equivocal"" and ""inconsistent"" with his declaration. Gold, who visits Redstone two or three times a week, also testified that ""he could not understand Redstone half the time,"" Cowan wrote. The new exam can take place at either Redstone's home or the doctor's office if Redstone prefers, Cowan said.Redstone's advance healthcare directive makes Gold responsible for gauging whether he can manage his own care, court filings show. But the judge said Gold testified that he did not know it was his responsibility.

77,"  (New throughout, adds time for exam, details from ruling)By Dan Levine and Lisa RichwineJan 22 Viacom Inc's 92-year-old Executive Chairman Sumner Redstone should be examined by a psychiatrist hired by the ex-girlfriend who has questioned his mental competency, a California judge ruled on Friday.The decision may provide investors with new information about Redstone's capabilities. He controls Viacom and CBS Corp , although his role at the companies has grown less visible.Viacom cut Redstone's pay 85 percent to $2 million last year, the company said in a securities filing on Friday, citing ""reduced responsibilities,""Geriatric psychiatrist Stephen Read will conduct the court-ordered mental examination within the next 10 days, said Pierce O'Donnell, an attorney for Redstone's former girlfriend Manuela Herzer.Redstone's attorneys have not indicated whether they will appeal, a development that could affect the schedule. They have argued that Herzer has filed the suit for financial gain.Read may interview Redstone for up to an hour, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge David Cowan said in his ruling. Redstone's attorneys acknowledge he has a speech impairment, and Cowan wrote that the executive's nurses and speech therapists may be present during the exam. Herzer and her attorneys cannot be present.Herzer's lawsuit filed in November said that Redstone had chosen her to make healthcare decisions for him in case he was not able to. It claimed the billionaire was mentally incompetent when he replaced her as his designated healthcare agent on Oct. 16 with Viacom Chief Executive Philippe Dauman.Read, in a declaration filed in November on behalf of Herzer, said he believed Redstone lacked the mental capacity to make that change. He cited testimony from Herzer and other witnesses but he had not examined Redstone in person. Redstone's primary physician, Dr. Richard Gold, told the court Redstone was fully aware of what he was doing at the time.Gold was deposed by Herzer's attorneys this month. The judge said in his ruling called Gold's deposition testimony ""equivocal"" and ""inconsistent"" with his declaration.Gold, who visits Redstone two or three times a week, also testified that ""he could not understand Redstone half the time,"" Cowan wrote. The new exam can take place at either Redstone's home or the doctor's office if Redstone prefers, Cowan said.Redstone's advance healthcare directive makes Gold responsible for gauging whether he can manage his own care, court filings show. But the judge said Gold testified that he did not know it was his responsibility. The judge said Gold also testified that he had ""no experience"" making such decisions. Gold said he believed Redstone could withstand a short mental exam, Cowan said in the ruling.Still, Cowan rejected a request by Herzer's lawyers to depose Redstone.

78,"   By Jessica Toonkel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Feb 4 Sumner Redstone was the mogul who never wanted to retire. For years he held on to his media empire with the same tenacity he used in clinging to the windowsill of a burning hotel in 1979.But Redstone, who celebrated his 92nd birthday last May with a party thrown by his girlfriends at the time, resigned on Wednesday as executive chairman of CBS Corp amid challenges to his mental competence. On Thursday, the board of Viacom Inc, the company that owns the Paramount movie studio, MTV and other assets, gave his chairmanship to Philippe Dauman and made Redstone chairman emeritus.The changes came after Redstone underwent a mental examination last Friday by a psychiatrist hired by his former girlfriend, Manuela Herzer. She challenged his mental competency with a lawsuit in November 2015 after she was removed as his designated healthcare agent. The results of last week's examination have not been made public.Redstone, a Harvard-educated lawyer from Boston, became one of U.S. media's most powerful figures by building up his family's theater chain, National Amusements, starting in the 1950s.He was in his 60s when he made his big push into media, buying Viacom in 1987 for $3.4 billion with mostly borrowed money and Paramount for more than $10 billion a few years later. CBS was added to the portfolio in 1999 in a deal valued at $37 billion.On Wednesday, Forbes magazine estimated Redstone's fortune at $5.2 billion. Redstone had been a dominating force in his companies until recently, clearly in control at shareholder meetings and on conference calls. Even as questions about his health became louder, in a June 2015 interview with Vanity Fair, he said, ""You should know that I am never retiring!""Later in the year, the Wall Street Journal said he had suffered mini-strokes that made speaking difficult, although he remained mentally sharp.RISK TAKER  Redstone built a reputation as a colorful, risk-taking executive who did as he pleased. He claimed to swim naked every day and was frequently surrounded by beautiful young women.He had a penchant for forcing out top executives and had business conflicts with his son and daughter. He once temporarily banned Tom Cruise from the Paramount lot because he thought the actor's personal life was hurting the box office for ""Mission Impossible III.""""With a striking head of orange hair, Redstone is a vainglorious, old-school egomaniac who has an operatic personal life that has been largely kept out of the media undoubtedly because he controls so much of it,"" media critic Michael Wolff wrote in New York magazine in 2002. Redstone had been a guest at a Boston hotel in 1979 when an arson fire swept into his room. He clung with one arm as he kneeled on a narrow third-floor windowsill ledge as flames roared out the window until a fireman on a ladder truck rescued him. He said the fire burned his legs down to the veins and it took several surgeries and many months to recover.""The heat and flames roaring out of the room burned off my pajamas and peeled away my skin,"" Redstone wrote in his book ""A Passion to Win, published in 2001. ""... The pain was excruciating but I refused to let go.""Redstone's biggest deals came after the fire but he said the ordeal did not necessarily inspire him to become a media magnate.""The most exciting things that have happened to me in my professional life have occurred after the fire but not because of it,"" he said in the book. ""It doesn't take near death to bring you to life. Life begins whenever you want it to begin.""Redstone, who was born on May 27, 1923, went through Harvard in three years and during World War Two worked with an elite U.S. Army unit that cracked Japanese codes.Redstone divorced his first wife, Phyllis, in 1999 after 55 years of marriage. In 2003, he wed schoolteacher Paula Fortunato, who was four decades younger, in a marriage that lasted five years.

79,"   By Jessica Toonkel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Viacom Inc's board of directors named Chief Executive Officer Philippe Dauman as executive chairman, replacing majority owner Sumner Redstone, overriding calls for an independent board chief from Redstone's daughter, who voted against Dauman. Viacom (VIAB.O) announced on Thursday that the ailing 92-year-old Redstone was becoming chairman emeritus, a day after CBS Corp (CBS.N) said Redstone, also the CBS majority owner, was stepping down as executive chairman and being replaced by CEO Leslie Moonves.The boards of CBS and Viacom have been discussing Redstone stepping down for several weeks, according to two sources familiar with the situation. Thursday's decision puts Viacom firmly in the hands of Dauman, a longtime associate of Sumner Redstone. His daughter, Shari, said in a statement she wanted someone who was not a member of her father's trust to run Viacom, which would have excluded Dauman.Dauman and Moonves are natural rivals as leaders of the two halves of the empire that Redstone separated 10 years ago. After Redstone's eventual death, analysts expect several scenarios, such as selling the companies in pieces, leaving them as they are, or reuniting them, which could pit the executives against one another. Sumner Redstone and the rest of Viacom's board voted in favor of Dauman, and only Shari Redstone voted against him, according to a source close to the company. Viacom said Shari Redstone turned down the non-executive chairman role. Shari Redstone will ""continue to advocate for what she believes to be in the best interests of Viacom shareholders,” she said in a statement. Viacom shares initially rose sharply, but later pared gains, closing up 1.5 percent at $45.34 on Nasdaq.Investor reaction was mixed. SpringOwl Asset Management, a Viacom shareholder that has agitated for change, was disappointed by the move. ""It raises questions about the board, corporate governance and fiduciary duties,"" the firm said in a statement. ""The market agrees ... that someone other than Philippe Dauman should be the Chairman."" Michael Cuggino, president and portfolio manager at San Francisco-based Permanent Portfolio of Family Of Funds, which is the fifth largest voting shareholder in Viacom and CBS,  applauded Dauman's appointment, and was willing to give him time to improve the company’s performance. “Viacom’s issues have not gone away and they still need to be tackled, but all the noise surrounding Sumner’s situation has been taken out of the equation,” Cuggino said. “The answer to whether Philippe is the right guy to do this will come later.""Sal Muoio, whose investment firm also is a top owner of voting Viacom shares, said he is also willing to give Dauman time: “This at least is a step toward clarity. I think we need to wait and see how these operational things unfold.” Mario Gabelli, the largest Viacom shareholder outside the Redstone family, said on financial news channel CNBC that Dauman has six to nine months to prove himself. ""Philippe has to deliver,"" Gabelli told Reuters in an interview. ""How does he jump-start the process? It's going to be tough to get into the digital world and over-the-top (Internet), given his perception of what his core competences are. It's going to be a challenge."" Gabelli dismissed the idea that Moonves could take over both companies: “He can’t do both, I don’t think.” Redstone hived off Viacom from CBS, expecting faster growth from the owner of MTV and Paramount than the storied television network, but in recent years CBS has outperformed Viacom. CBS shares are up more than 135 percent in the last five years, while Viacom has eked out a 3 percent gain.Viacom in recent years has suffered from falling ratings at its cable networks as its audience of younger viewers migrate to online and mobile video. In April 2015, the company announced a restructuring to save $350 million annually. Dauman has taken steps to woo advertisers by using data to better target their commercials. The elder Redstone has faced questions about his health and leadership abilities for some time. He underwent a mental examination last Friday by a psychiatrist hired by his former girlfriend, Manuela Herzer, who has challenged Redstone's mental competency in a lawsuit.The results of the examination have not been made public. Neither CBS nor Viacom explained why Redstone stepped aside. After Herzer's lawsuit, investor Gabelli called for the media company to disclose the state of Redstone's mental competence.Shari Redstone, 60, has said both companies needed an ""independent voice"" as chair who was not involved in the family's personal matters. She supported Moonves as CBS chief.Dauman serves as a Sumner Redstone trustee in the event of his death as well as his health care proxy. Shari Redstone believes Herzer's lawsuit is weighing on her father's mind. ""Ms. Herzer's lawsuit, and the fact she is actually trying to once again insert herself into my father's life, is causing my father tremendous stress and agitation,"" she said in a declaration to a California court filed this week. Redstone controls about 80 percent of the voting shares in Viacom and CBS Corp through a holding company.In January, Viacom said it cut the compensation of its top two executives, Redstone and Dauman, as the company faced business pressures and a sharp drop in its share price.

CBS and Viacom also received faxed notifications, according to Fortune, which first reported the news of Redstone's move Friday evening.A spokesman for Dauman called the steps ""illegal and invalid"" in an e-mailed statement to Reuters. ""They are a shameful effort by Shari Redstone to seize control by unlawfully using her ailing father Sumner Redstone's name and signature.

A judge set an early June hearing on the possible removal of CEO Philippe Dauman from the trust that will control the media company when Redstone dies or is deemed incapacitated. In a statement issued through a spokesman, Redstone, who turned 93 on Friday, said he would act in ""the best interests of shareholders,"" when weighing whether or not to oust Dauman and the company's board.Redstone, who holds 80 percent of the voting shares in Viacom (VIAB.O) and CBS Corp (CBS.N), last week removed Dauman and Viacom board member George Abrams from the seven-person trust that will control the shares after Redstone exits.In the statement, Redstone said he will apply ""the same deliberation and consideration"" he used when he removed Dauman and George Abrams as trustees. Redstone's latest missive comes amid reports that Viacom's board is preparing a lawsuit challenging any attempts to remove its members or the CEO.  Dauman, 62, has filed a legal challenge to stop his removal from the trust, arguing that Redstone was being manipulated by his daughter, Shari. She has called that allegation ""absurd"" and said her father made his own decisions.Judge George Phelan scheduled to hear the case on June 7, after Dauman filed a petition to have the trial date expedited.A spokesman for Dauman and the Viacom board was not immediately available to comment. Viacom's shares are up 13 percent since news broke last Friday that Redstone had removed Dauman and Abrams from the trust and the National Amusements Board, as some investors bet that a change in management could lead to a sale of the media company.

Also on Friday, Standard & Poor's revised downward its assessment of Viacom's management and governance to ""fair"" from ""satisfactory"" because it believes the litigation and succession planning issues ""reflect poorly"" on Viacom's corporate governance.Viacom shares have fallen more than 50 percent in the past two years as its cable networks, including MTV and Nickelodeon, suffered from falling ratings as younger viewers migrate online and to mobile video.

119,"   By Hillary Flynn and Jessica Toonkel  NEW YORK (IFR) - Media conglomerate Viacom (Baa3/BBB-/BBB) is preparing to price a US dollar bond as soon as this week, market sources told IFR on Monday.Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley are arranging investor calls for the bond on Tuesday and Wednesday, according to an email sent to an investor and seen by IFR.The deal comes amid reports that the company is preparing itself to be sold to CBS following an announcement that interim CEO Tom Dooley would leave in mid-November.   Moody's downgraded Viacom's long-term debt ratings on Thursday to Baa3 from Baa2, citing a weaker than expected rebound in operating performance and high leverage.  ""Viacom's leverage has risen well above the 3.25x sustained leverage threshold for the Baa2 rating, leaving no room for additional debt or operational setbacks under the company's ratings,"" it said.  Viacom said it plans to raise debt to fund near-term maturities, the rating agency said.  While this deal and dividend reduction helps the company's financial flexibility, it won't be sufficient to cut leverage levels that are in line with other Baa2 credits, Moody's said.

122,"   By Hillary Flynn  NEW YORK, Sept 29 (IFR) - Investors piled billions of orders into a US$1.3bn bond from media giant Viacom on Thursday, betting that a possible merger with CBS would help turn around the struggling business.The deal was one of the most heavily oversubscribed investment-grade bonds of late, notching up an US$11bn order book even as pricing was tightened sharply during bookbuild.It was M&A speculation that largely drove demand for the trade - and attractive features that bolstered investor confidence.Sumner Redstone's National Amusements, the majority shareholder of CBS and Viacom, on Thursday proposed a merger of the two companies, suggesting a reversal of a split made 10 years ago.""If Viacom and CBS do merge, spreads could tighten in another 20bp,"" one investor who bid for the bonds told IFR.Viacom is teetering on the brink of junk with ratings of Baa3/BBB-/BBB. Moody's Investors Service downgraded Viacom just this month, citing a weaker-than-expected rebound in operating performance and high debt.Its credit spreads were in any case under pressure in recent weeks following dismal results, rising leverage and a management shake-up that included the firing of its CEO Philippe Dauman and resignation of interim CEO Thomas Dooley. But analysts believe a re-merger would be a credit plus for Viacom - whose cable television networks include Comedy Central, MTV and Nickelodeon. CBS has slightly higher ratings of Baa2/BBB/BBB.MERGER OPTIMISM  Spreads on its outstanding 3.875% 2024s rallied by 32bp this week and the growing optimism about the credit was further reflected in the pricing of the new deal on Thursday.The new bonds priced more than 50bp inside initial price thoughts - one of the most aggressive moves in months in the primary - with US$400m five-year bonds pricing at T+120bp and US$900m 10-year at T+195bp.At those levels, the bonds came with no new issue concession over Viacom's outstanding bonds.Part of the attraction for the bonds was the deal structure that protected investors. During a two-day roadshow this week, the buyside insisted any new deal should have ratings covenants - and the company included just that in Thursday's deal.If Viacom's ratings fall into junk, the coupon on the debt increases 25bp per agency per notch below investment grade - capped at 2%.""They said they were committed to their investment grade rating on the calls, but the step-ups showed us they meant it,"" another investor said.The investor cautioned the bond spreads could widen if the merger does not happen - but it was a risk many seemed willing to take.The proceeds from the two-part deal, split between five-year and 10-year tranches, will help the media company boost liquidity and refinance short-term debt maturities.Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley were the lead bookrunners.

144,"   By Jessica Toonkel  Possible sticking points have emerged ahead of negotiations between media companies CBS Corp (CBS.N) and Viacom Inc (VIAB.O) about a potential merger, including who will be on the board of the combined company and what it would be called, people familiar with the situation told Reuters.Sumner Redstone and his daughter Shari Redstone, who own the majority of voting shares of both Viacom and CBS through their privately-held movie theater company National Amusements Inc, are pushing to recombine the two companies 10 years after they split from each other.Each company has set up a special committee of directors to explore a potential merger and have hired bankers as advisers. Discussions are still in the early stages and bigger issues loom, including price and how the deal would be structured, the sources said.Many investors and observers believe a deal could be announced as soon as by the end of the year and that CBS Chief Executive Leslie Moonves will run the combined company.Governance issues are a potential source of tension, though. Shari Redstone wants to keep the five National Amusements directors she handpicked for Viacom's board if it merges with CBS, the sources said.  National Amusements replaced former Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman and four other directors on Viacom's board last spring as part of a battle to maintain control over the owner of MTV, Comedy Central and other cable networks.It is unclear if Moonves and CBS's board would push back, but they do want to make sure Moonves has autonomy over the combined company. A compromise could involve setting up a larger board. There is also a question over the combined company's name, although no talks on the issue have been held. Moonves and the company's board want the CBS name to remain, while the Redstones want to ensure the Viacom name lives on, said the sources, who wished to remain anonymous because they are not permitted to speak to the media.For the 93-year-old Redstone, who was CEO of Viacom from 1996 to 2006 and executive chair of both Viacom and CBS until last year, preserving the Viacom name is part of his legacy, the sources said.""Viacom is me, and I am Viacom,"" Sumner Redstone told Fortune magazine in 1999. CBS executives believe their brand is more powerful, the sources said. Viacom has been struggling to turn around declining ratings and sinking ad revenue, while CBS has been a steady performer. So far this year, CBS' shares are up 26 percent while Viacom's shares are down 6.5 percent.During the CBS earnings call earlier this month, Moonves said explorations were still in the early stages, adding that ""if it looks right and is structured properly, it could be an attractive opportunity.""

149,"   By Jessica Toonkel and Greg Roumeliotis | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Media mogul Sumner Redstone and his daughter Shari called off their failed effort to merge CBS Corp (CBS.N) and Viacom Inc (VIAB.O) on Monday, sending shares of Viacom - widely viewed as the weaker company - down almost 8 percent.The collapse of the plan, which never got beyond initial talks, raises questions about the future of both Redstone-controlled companies just as scale becomes more important in a media industry set to be reshaped by AT&T's (T.N) deal to buy Time Warner Inc (TWX.N). The end of negotiations was not a complete surprise. Les Moonves, the longtime chief executive of CBS, said last week talks were still stuck in the early stages, more than two months after the Redstones asked the boards of both companies to explore a tie-up.The two sides never entered talks on pricing and were far apart on Viacom's value, according to two sources familiar with the situation.Shares of Viacom were down 7.9 percent at $39.10 in afternoon trading. CBS shares initially rose 1.8 percent, touching a nearly 2-1/2 year high, after CNBC cited a New York Post report that Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) was interested in buying the company. Verizon declined to comment. In afternoon trading, CBS shares were down 0.4 percent at $62.12.  STILL NEEDS FIXING    National Amusements, the privately held movie company through which Shari Redstone and her 93-year-old father control 80 percent of the voting shares of CBS and Viacom, said in a letter they stopped pushing for a deal on the expectation of a turnaround at Viacom under new leadership.Viacom named Bob Bakish, head of its international business, acting chief executive officer at the end of October, and made that position permanent on Monday afternoon as it announced the end of merger explorations.Viacom, which owns Nickelodeon, Comedy Central and MTV, has been struggling to turn around declining ad revenue and ratings while CBS is home to top-rated shows such ""The Big Bang Theory"" and ""Thursday Night Football.""Mario Gabelli, whose firm is the second-largest owner of voting shares of Viacom and CBS, said he was not disappointed with the failure of merger plans and that he still believes that ultimately the two might merge. “Viacom needs to be fixed,” he said. One sticking point in negotiations was that CBS's Moonves wanted autonomy over the merged company.  National Amusements was willing to compromise on this issue, but in the end decided to let Bakish retain control of Viacom, according to the sources, who wished to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak publicly.Bakish already has started taking action after just a few weeks as acting CEO. Last month,  the company announced it was buying Argentine broadcaster Television Federal SA from telecom carrier Telefonica SA for $345 million.He is also looking to improve relations with affiliates and is working on a plan to turn around MTV, a top priority for him, he told Reuters in November. Last week, he replaced Viacom's head of distribution, Denise Denson, a longtime executive who worked closely with former CEO Philippe Dauman.  A DECADE APART  In September, National Amusements called on Viacom and CBS to consider recombining, 10 years after Viacom was spun off from CBS. Shari Redstone had been in favor of recombining the two under Moonves, sources have previously told Reuters. Industry speculation that the two might rejoin increased this year after the Redstones prevailed in a power struggle that resulted in Dauman's departure. A Viacom spokesman confirmed it had received the letter from National Amusements, which was first reported by CNBC. A CBS spokesman declined to comment.    National Amusement's letter also said: ""CBS continues to perform exceptionally well under Les Moonves."" Relations between Moonves and Shari Redstone continue to be good, the source said. This week, the two plan to go to Boston for the premiere of the film ""Patriots Day,"" produced by CBS Films.

151,"   By Liana B. Baker and Jessica Toonkel  Sumner Redstone's holding company National Amusements Inc's decision to abandon a merger of its prized media assets, CBS Corp and Viacom Inc, leaves them under pressure to buy or partner with peers in an industry where scale matters.Redstone's daughter Shari, who controls CBS's and Viacom's controlling shareholder National Amusements together with her father, told the New York Times Dealbook conference last month that scale was crucial for both companies, because it would give them greater pricing power in content distribution. National Amusements, however, does not currently want to sell either company, according to people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity discussing confidential deliberations. The chief executives of CBS and Viacom are also currently not keen on making big acquisitions, because they are focused on executing their operational strategy, these people said.Nevertheless, the two companies may be forced to consider acquisitions if they come under more competitive pressure, the sources said. They may also turn to partnerships with media companies as an alternative to outright acquisitions, the sources added.""Should Viacom remain independent, we think it will need a strategic partner to help co-finance a larger and more expensive film slate,"" Brean Murray analyst Alan Gould said in a research note on Monday.CBS, Viacom and National Amusements declined to comment.Pressure on media companies to consolidate has increased in the last two months, as some industry giants have sought to merge with major distributors of their content, in a bid to expand their reach and profitability.In October, U.S. telecommunications giant AT&T Inc agreed to acquire media conglomerate Time Warner Inc for $85.4 billion, while last week Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox Inc reached a preliminary agreement to acquire the 61 percent of Sky Plc it does not already own, valuing the British broadcaster at $23 billion. Viacom has already been looking at some modest acquisitions. Last month it acquired Argentine broadcaster Telefe for $345 million in cash, and in 2014 it paid $760 million for British broadcaster Channel 5. Were Bob Bakish, who was named on Monday as the permanent replacement of previous Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman, to explore more acquisitions, he could again look across the Atlantic for opportunities beyond the fiercely competitive U.S. media market, the sources said. German broadcaster ProSiebenSat 1 and its main rival, RTL Group, would be logical targets, the sources said, as would ITV Plc in Britain and Entertainment One in Canada. However, Viacom's $12 billion debt pile makes it unlikely it would spend top dollar on acquisitions.There may be smaller deals for Viacom to pursue, however, that could boost its Paramount movie studio. MGM, which owns a film library and has been exploring its options for some time following its emergence from bankruptcy six years ago, could help boost Paramount's margins if it was acquired, some media bankers suggested.  None of these companies offered a comment on the possibility of being acquired by Viacom. MOVIE STUDIO BUY?  Jefferies LLC analyst John Janedis said in a research note that he thinks CBS should focus on buying ""TV-centric content related assets, rather than cable networks and film."" However, CBS CEO Leslie Moonves' interest may be in buying a movie studio. Sources familiar with the matter said that CBS has approached Sony Pictures in recent weeks, although its owner, Sony Corp, has shown no interest in selling. Sony declined to comment.Lions Gate Entertainment Corp, which has a movie and television studio, just closed its acquisition of Starz, and could also be an option for CBS, according to one media banker. AMC Networks Inc, controlled by New York's Dolan Family, could also have operational synergies with CBS's cable channel, Showtime. Lions Gate did not respond to requests for comment and AMC declined comment.To be sure, Moonves publicly has said CBS can do without any major acquisition. ""Will we ever be of a scale of a Disney or an Apple? I doubt it. We are able to play the game just fine as long as we keep doing what we do, which is produce great content for CBS, for Showtime, for whatever the platform is,"" Moonves told the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference last week. An alternative to acquisitions may be partnerships, including between CBS and Viacom. Bakish has already been meeting with heads of Viacom affiliates talking about potential partnerships, one of the people said. Last month, he told Reuters finding ways to partner with affiliates was a priority for the company.

152,"   By Jessica Toonkel  Controlling shareholder Sumner Redstone will step down from the Viacom (VIAB.O) board of directors after the company's annual meeting in February, according to a company filing on Friday. The ailing, 93-year old Redstone, who has not attended an annual investor meeting since 2014, will continue to participate in meetings in a ""non-voting"" role, according to the filing. It was Redstone's decision to step down, according to a source familiar with the situation, who did not want to be named because discussions were private.Redstone's decision marks the end of an era for the elder media mogul, who once considered Viacom his crown jewel. He bought Viacom through a hostile takeover in 1987, and later added Paramount Pictures and CBS. He split Viacom from CBS in 2006.  However, Redstone's health and mental capacity has been a point of inquiry as of late. The media mogul has trouble speaking and needs around-the-clock care, according to court documents filed in a suit by his former girlfriend questioning his mental capacity. Redstone and his daughter Shari Redstone control Viacom, which owns cable networks including Comedy Central and Nickelodeon, and CBS Corp (CBS.N), home to HBO and shows like ""The Big Bang Theory,"" through their privately held movie theater company National Amusements Inc. The announcement that Redstone is stepping down from the board came just days after he and Shari Redstone withdrew a proposal for CBS and Viacom to explore a merger. Redstone resigned as executive chair of the board last February to become chairman emeritus. He was replaced by then-Chief Executive Officer Philippe Dauman, who departed in August after losing a fight for control of the company to the Redstones.Redstone stepped down as executive chair of CBS when he became chairman emeritus at Viacom. A CBS spokesman declined to comment if Redstone would step down from the CBS board. CBS' proxy comes out in the spring because it operates on a different fiscal calendar than Viacom. Viacom is working to turn itself around as it has suffered from declining ratings and advertising revenue.Shares of Viacom rose 2.5 percent to $35.77 in morning New York Stock Exchange trading.

Herzog, a 25-year veteran at Viacom known for helping develop such MTV hits as ""The Real World"" and Comedy Central's ""The Daily Show,"" is leaving as part of a restructuring following the appointment of Bob Bakish as chief executive officer earlier this month, sources told Reuters.Herzog was most recently president of Viacom's Music and Entertainment Group which also includes VH1, Spike and Logo. Bakish said in the memo that the brands in Herzog's group will now directly report to him.    Viacom named Bakish, former head of its international business, as acting chief executive officer at the end of October, then permanent CEO on Dec. 12 as it announced the end of merger explorations with CBS Corp (CBS.N).He is the second high-ranking executive to announce a departure this month. Viacom's head of distribution, Denise Denson, a longtime executive who worked closely with former CEO Philippe Dauman, left earlier in December.     ENVY OF PEERS? Bakish thanked Herzog for his ""incredible contributions"" to Viacom, noting his ""sharp creative insight."" In his own memo to his staff, Herzog reciprocated Bakish's praise, telling employees they were ""in very good hands"" and predicting that Viacom would once again become ""the envy of its peers.""  Herzog began his career at Viacom as president of MTV Productions in 1984 and became president of Comedy Central in 1995. After leaving the company for a few years, he returned in 2004 to head the music and entertainment group.While Herzog helped elevate MTV and Comedy Central during his tenure, over the past few years both networks have suffered from lackluster ratings and the loss of talent such as Jon Stewart, the former host of ""The Daily Show,"" and Stephen Colbert, the host of ""The Colbert Report.""In an interview with Reuters in November, Bakish said fixing MTV is one of his top priorities.
