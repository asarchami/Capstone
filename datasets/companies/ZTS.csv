12,"  (Adds source comments on potential pricing and Valeant moves)By Olivia Oran and Svea Herbst-BaylissNov 16 Allergan Inc is close to a buyout deal worth up to $65.5 billion by Actavis Plc, one that could end months of pursuit by Canada's Valeant Pharmaceuticals  and William Ackman's hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, according to a person familiar with the matter.Actavis may pay Allergan between $215 and $220 per share, with the final price likely coming at the high end of that range, according to the source. A deal could be announced as early as Monday, the source said.If such a price materializes, it will likely put Botox maker Allergan out of Valeant's reach, despite the drugmaker's willingness to raise its cash and stock offer above a current value of about $54 billion, two sources familiar with the matter said. However, if the agreed price comes in lower and Actavis investors show skepticism over the deal by trading their shares lower, Valeant may consider a new approach, according to one of the sources familiar with Valeant's thinking.Actavis, Allergan and Valeant declined to comment. Pershing Square was not available for comment.""I think Actavis is going to win,"" said Erik Gordon, a professor at the Ross School of Business, University of Michigan. ""Ackman is going to be content to take his profit on his Allergan shares and go onto the next battle."" The bid for Allergan has proven one of the most complex and unorthodox in the healthcare sector. Ackman disclosed in late April a nearly 10 percent stake in the drugmaker and plans to bid for the company together with Valeant.Allergan's resistance to the deal has led both sides to fight their cases with shareholders, in court and even raise the potential of alternate acquisitions. Allergan had held on-and-off discussions about purchasing Salix Pharmaceuticals Ltd for more than $10 billion in cash, a deal that would have made it harder for Valeant to acquire the combined company.Last week, Pershing Square unveiled an 8.5 percent stake in animal health company Zoetis Inc, another potential takeover target. Some viewed the move as possibly supplanting Ackman's interest in Allergan.News of an imminent deal with Actavis comes ahead of a Dec. 18 special meeting of Allergan shareholders initiated by Ackman, who is seeking to replace several of Allergan's board members and compel the company to enter takeover talks.""Ironically, the Allergan shareholders should send thank-you notes to Bill Ackman,"" said Gordon, noting they may soon receive far more for their shares than they would have considered even six months ago.

13,"   By Rod Nickel and Olivia Oran  WINNIPEG/NEW YORK Nov 17 The failure of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc to buy Allergan Inc  leaves it with nothing to show for a seven-month, bruising pursuit.Losing Allergan to Actavis PLC also hurts Valeant's deal-making reputation, said a source close to the company not authorized to speak publicly.Allergan announced a $66 billion deal with Actavis on Monday that trumped Valeant's offer.Valeant has made dozens of buys and is expected to triple revenues over three years by the end of 2014. But Allergan was a public setback for a company aiming to become a top-five pharma company by the end of 2016.Allergan's rebuff will embolden future targets to ""push back,"" said Peter Mann, portfolio manager at Gluskin Sheff + Associates, which owns shares in both Valeant and Allergan. ""Clearly, (Chief Executive) Dave Pyott and his team at Allergan have proven that there are other avenues,"" he said.Valeant CEO Michael Pearson said on Monday that the Laval, Quebec-based company could not justify matching Actavis' bid.Losing Allergan hurts Valeant's reputation for now, but in the long run its business model's advantages should win out, said Gautam Dhingra, CEO of Valeant shareholder High Pointe Capital Management. Valeant has taken months of criticism from Allergan about its acquisition-focused model. Valeant shares rose slightly on Monday afternoon.It is unlikely Valeant will try another hostile transaction, said Glenn Greenberg, managing director of Valeant shareholder Brave Warrior Advisors, because it is ""no fun having the company you built impugned and trashed.""Valeant demonstrated, however, that it can identify good value and showed discipline by not overpaying, he said. Pearson has said he is active in numerous sets of mergers and acquisition talks at any time. Valeant looks for companies with cash-pay models and opportunities for cost cutting and tax savings.Valeant's partner in the Allergan bid, Pershing Square Capital Management, owns a stake in animal health care company Zoetis Inc, offering a possible back-up plan.Zoetis is attractive, but its stock is highly valued, Morningstar analyst David Krempa wrote last week. Valeant could instead pursue animal health divisions at Merck & Co Inc  or Boehringer Ingelheim, he said.""Valeant probably feels some pressure to show that it can do another deal relatively soon,"" Dhingra said.(Reporting by Rod Nickel in Winnipeg, Manitoba; Editing by Richard Chang)",2014-11-17,ZTS,"Mon Nov 17, 2014 | 1:25pm EST",Losing Allergan deals blow to Valeant reputation,http://www.reuters.com//article/allergan-ma-valeant-pharms-idUSL2N0T718020141117?type=companyNews

16,"   By Michael Erman and Brian Grow | NEW YORK/ATLANTA  NEW YORK/ATLANTA It is one of the most potent antibiotics used by U.S. cattle and dairy farmers, the key component in the top-selling drug line of Zoetis, the world’s largest animal health company.But the strength of the antibiotic ceftiofur – and the frequency with which it’s being misused on farms across America – has created a threat to human health that may overshadow the drug’s effectiveness, a Reuters examination shows. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration cautioned in 2012 that ceftiofur could pose a “high public health risk,” in part because the drug belongs to a class of antibiotics considered critically important in human medicine. The warning is the FDA’s strongest kind. The concern is that ceftiofur in animals could spawn antibiotic-resistant bacteria, superbugs that can infect people and defeat conventional medical treatment, even when the drug is used as directed.A Reuters analysis of government data indicates that the risks to human health may be more significant than previously known. Since last year, records kept by the U.S. Department of Agriculture show that traces of ceftiofur were found at illegal levels in slaughtered animals more frequently than with any other drug. In 2013, ceftiofur alone accounted for one-fourth of all residue violations logged by the USDA, the data show.The ceftiofur residues are not themselves considered dangerous to people if ingested, because the government sets its standards well below hazardous levels.But the traces serve as a warning sign that the drug was used shortly before the animal was killed, thus increasing the chances that the meat contains superbugs, said Guy Loneragan, a veterinary epidemiologist at Texas Tech University. Studies show that ceftiofur, more than most other drugs, can sharply increase the amount of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in an animal.“It kills off weaker bugs and allows stronger ones to survive and multiply,” Loneragan said. The effect is especially pronounced soon after the drug has been used, studies show.Zoetis says ceftiofur is safe to use as directed.  “The use of ceftiofur continues to be appropriate when used according to the label directions in those animals that are in at-risk situations,” said Scott Brown, vice president of global therapeutics research at Zoetis.The stakes are especially high because the drug is part of a crucial class of antibiotics called cephalosporins. The class includes ceftriaxone, a drug that’s vital to treating pneumonia, meningitis and salmonella infections in children, according to the FDA. The use of one type of cephalosporin can compromise the effectiveness of others in the same class.“There is a very clear link between ceftiofur use and ceftriaxone resistance,” said Paul Fey, a professor of microbiology at University of Nebraska Medical Center. “We know that ceftiofur-resistant salmonella are clearly ceftriaxone-resistant.”ECONOMIC INCENTIVES Despite the perils, there are economic incentives to misuse ceftiofur. The potent drug can keep a sick cow alive long enough for a dairy farmer to sell the animal to a slaughterhouse. A course of treatment can cost from $20 to more than $100, relatively high for veterinary antibiotics. But that is far less than what the farmer stands to make if the animal survives until it can be sold for meat. Dairy cows for slaughter are now fetching $1,500 or more, according to farmers and USDA data.Hugh Byron ran a dairy farm in Hillsboro, Kentucky, until 2011 and kept cattle until this year. He says he frequently used ceftiofur to treat common infections in his cows. In July 2010, a dairy cow sent to slaughter from Byron’s farm tested positive for 5.61 milligrams of ceftiofur residue per kilogram of tissue sample. That was 14 times higher than the 0.4 milligram per kilogram tolerance level set by the FDA.Byron admits that he has administered ceftiofur at the end of his animals’ lives hoping they’d hang on, so that a slaughterhouse would accept the cows and pay him.“We’re talking about our livelihood, our money. We’re trying to save the cow and if we can’t save the cow, we’re trying to salvage it,” said Byron. “In other words, send her to the stockyard and get something out of it. So there’s a temptation to fudge on it.”Zoetis features the drug’s economic advantages in its marketing to farmers and veterinarians. One of ceftiofur’s features is a short withdrawal period - the FDA-mandated time between when an animal stops taking an antibiotic and when its milk or meat is certain to be sufficiently free of residue to pass inspection.The drug’s time advantage is significant. In the case of milk, if a cow takes penicillin, the farmer must discard all the milk produced for at least two days and as many as 15 days after the drug is last given. There’s often no withdrawal period for certain ceftiofur products, so a cow can keep producing milk while taking it.“No wasted milk ensures a better return on investment,” Zoetis says on its website about its ceftiofur-brand drug Excenel. THE WITHDRAWAL PERIOD The residue-testing program is supposed to help the government ensure that farmers are not misusing the drugs.  The regulations contain a gap, however. The USDA tests animals for traces of antibiotics, to prevent excess levels of drugs such as ceftiofur from entering the food supply. But the residue program doesn't test for the presence of resistant bacteria. In the case of ceftiofur, those bugs can survive in an animal past the end of the drug's required withdrawal period, studies show.Loneragan of Texas Tech said his research suggests the FDA should analyze whether high levels of resistant bacteria remain beyond the withdrawal period. A longer period may be warranted, he said, to ensure that the resistant bacteria population is reduced before the animal is slaughtered.The reason for the rise in ceftiofur violations isn’t clear. The USDA implemented a new test in 2012 that it says is better at identifying traces of all drugs. But the USDA residue data don’t show as large an increase in violations for penicillin and other antibiotics as they do for ceftiofur.FDA spokeswoman Juli Putnam said the agency “is aware of the increase in ceftiofur residue violations” and is gathering more information to “better understand the matter.” She said the agency is aware of Loneragan’s research findings as well, “and we continue to consider the evolving science related to the impact of antimicrobial use on bacterial populations.”Zoetis said the FDA has evaluated ceftiofur’s impact on antibiotic resistance in bacteria and has approved drugs containing the compound as recently as last year.Those caught misusing veterinary antibiotics face light consequences. Penalties include condemnation of the animal. FDA inspectors review a violator’s practices, which can result in warning letters ordering farmers to change how they administer the medicines. Further action is extremely rare, an examination of regulatory and court records shows.The residue testing program has been harshly criticized by federal auditors. A 2010 report by the Government Accountability Office found that the program ""is not accomplishing its mission of monitoring the food supply for harmful residues."" One result of the audit was the implementation two years later of the new residue testing methodology now used by the USDA and FDA.SUCCESSFUL DRUG                                   The widespread application of antibiotics in veterinary medicine poses enormous challenges for health authorities. Today, 80 percent of all antibiotics used in the United States are given to livestock, not to people. In September, Reuters documented how some of America’s largest poultry companies routinely mix low levels of antibiotics into the feed given to chickens, a practice that scientists believe is especially conducive to the growth of superbugs. About 2 million people in the United States are sickened each year by bacterial infections that resist conventional antibiotics, and at least 23,000 people die, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The World Health Organization called antibiotic resistance “a problem so serious it threatens the achievements of modern medicine.”Despite such concerns, sales of antibiotics for use in food animal production rose 16 percent by volume from 2009 to 2012, government data show. Sales of cephalosporins increased at more than twice that rate.The government has made some effort to curb ceftiofur use because of concerns about antibiotic resistance. The FDA requires farmers to obtain a prescription from a veterinarian. In 2012, the agency issued an order prohibiting most off-label uses of the drug, pointing to residues as one contributing factor.The rise in ceftiofur use is a boon to its largest maker, Florham, NJ-based Zoetis, the former animal drug unit of pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc. Ceftiofur-based brands are the company’s top-selling line, generating about $300 million in revenue per year since 2011, according to company financial reports.Zoetis markets its ceftiofur brands to veterinarians, who must prescribe the drug, and to farmers in YouTube videos and in veterinary and dairy publications. The drug has become one of the most popular antibiotics on American cattle farms. Veterinarians and farmers praise its potency, efficiency and ability to treat multiple ailments, from foot rot to bovine respiratory disease. ""SUCH A HUGE EFFECT"" “We had to use so little of it for such a huge effect,” said H. Morgan Scott, a veterinary epidemiologist at Texas A&M University’s College of Veterinary Medicine.Another selling point is the drug’s short withdrawal times. FDA withdrawal guidelines are based on the presence of antibiotic residue in meat. Compared with other antibiotics, ceftiofur is metabolized rapidly by cows – and so regulators require a shorter waiting period. The drug’s withdrawal periods are zero to three days for milk and four to 13 days for meat. With other drugs, the ranges can be four weeks or more for meat. Those short windows leave a potential safety gap. Even when ceftiofur is used as approved, one 2007 study shows, antibiotic-resistant bacteria remained present in the guts of cattle long after the drug was given. The FDA cited the study, whose authors include Loneragan and Scott, in the 2012 order reining in use of the drug. The study, published in the American Journal of Veterinary Research, found that one properly administered dose of a ceftiofur-based medication made by Zoetis resulted in 40 percent of the surviving e. Coli in cattle having resistance to ceftiofur six days after the dose. The resistant bacteria population remained above 20 percent of the total for two weeks. Resistant bacteria did not return to levels typical in untreated cattle for 28 days, well after ceftiofur’s withdrawal period, the study found.As part of the USDA’s National Residue Program, food safety regulators test meat for drugs and chemicals that could prove dangerous to consumers. In 2012, the USDA tested for drug residues in about 185,000 cattle – far less than 1 percent of the more than 33 million cattle slaughtered in the United States that year. The percentage of pigs, poultry and other animals tested is lower. If high drug residues are found, the results are turned over to the FDA for investigation and enforcement.In 2013, no single drug residue was found more frequently in slaughtered animals than ceftiofur, the Reuters analysis shows.Violations involving high levels of ceftiofur in meat rose by 323 percent between 2008 and 2013 – from 98 violations to 415. Last year alone, more than a quarter of all 1,634 residue violations were for ceftiofur – more than four times its share of violations in 2008, the analysis shows. Violations involving ceftiofur have continued at a similar rate during the first half of 2014.Dairy cows are one of America's major sources of ground beef, which in turn is the beef product most prone to bacterial infections. Dairy cows are also the leading source of ceftiofur residues, representing 76 percent of the 415 violations in 2013. Last year, 45 percent of the 1,634 residue violations for all drugs were found in dairy cows.Zoetis said it was aware of the residue violations but that they were small in number, and most – perhaps all – of the animals were pulled from the food supply when residues were found.“These are animals that probably should not have gone to slaughter, or there were mistakes and animals go to slaughter that didn’t follow withdrawal periods,” said John Hallberg, director of U.S. regulatory affairs at Zoetis.“YOUR BOTTOM LINE” Ceftiofur can save farmers money by keeping a cow milking longer and by preserving her value at the slaughter stage. In its marketing materials, Zoetis zeroes in on some of the savings.In one pitch, it says that using its Excede brand instead of penicillin to treat dairy cows with bovine respiratory disease could save a farmer more than $30 per animal, after factoring in the value of milk production not lost to withdrawal.The company makes a similar case for Excenel. “Protect your cows and your bottom line with EXCENEL,” its website says.There are also gains to be had at life’s end. Because of the short withdrawal times, farmers can get paid more quickly after treating the animal.“Shorter meat withdrawals. You’d have to wait 29 days longer” when using a rival drug, says an advertisement for Excede.Time is money for a farmer with a gravely ill cow on his hands. Interviews with farmers, veterinarians and field researchers, and a review of FDA warning letters, show ceftiofur has been administered to animals by farmers eager to keep a sick animal alive long enough to sell it.Byron, the 66-year-old retired dairyman in Kentucky, says ceftiofur is a wonder drug. It’s one of the more effective antibiotics, he found, and treated animals and their milk don’t have to be kept off market for long.“Our attitude, most of us, was if (ceftiofur) worked, if it’ll save a cow, we’ll spend the money,” Byron said. “You’re talking about a thousand-dollar animal or more.” After the USDA found high traces of ceftiofur in the cow he’d sold for slaughter, Byron received a letter from the FDA warning him to improve his processes. The agency evaluated his operation later that year, found it to be in order and closed the case. The agencies took no other action.

17,"   By Michael Erman and Brian Grow | NEW YORK/ATLANTA  NEW YORK/ATLANTA It is one of the most potent antibiotics used by U.S. cattle and dairy farmers, the key component in the top-selling drug line of Zoetis, the world’s largest animal health company.But the strength of the antibiotic ceftiofur – and the frequency with which it’s being misused on farms across America – has created a threat to human health that may overshadow the drug’s effectiveness, a Reuters examination shows. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration cautioned in 2012 that ceftiofur could pose a “high public health risk,” in part because the drug belongs to a class of antibiotics considered critically important in human medicine. The warning is the FDA’s strongest kind. The concern is that ceftiofur in animals could spawn antibiotic-resistant bacteria, superbugs that can infect people and defeat conventional medical treatment, even when the drug is used as directed.A Reuters analysis of government data indicates that the risks to human health may be more significant than previously known. Since last year, records kept by the U.S. Department of Agriculture show that traces of ceftiofur were found at illegal levels in slaughtered animals more frequently than with any other drug. In 2013, ceftiofur alone accounted for one-fourth of all residue violations logged by the USDA, the data show.The ceftiofur residues are not themselves considered dangerous to people if ingested, because the government sets its standards well below hazardous levels.But the traces serve as a warning sign that the drug was used shortly before the animal was killed, thus increasing the chances that the meat contains superbugs, said Guy Loneragan, a veterinary epidemiologist at Texas Tech University. Studies show that ceftiofur, more than most other drugs, can sharply increase the amount of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in an animal.“It kills off weaker bugs and allows stronger ones to survive and multiply,” Loneragan said. The effect is especially pronounced soon after the drug has been used, studies show.Zoetis says ceftiofur is safe to use as directed.  “The use of ceftiofur continues to be appropriate when used according to the label directions in those animals that are in at-risk situations,” said Scott Brown, vice president of global therapeutics research at Zoetis.The stakes are especially high because the drug is part of a crucial class of antibiotics called cephalosporins. The class includes ceftriaxone, a drug that’s vital to treating pneumonia, meningitis and salmonella infections in children, according to the FDA. The use of one type of cephalosporin can compromise the effectiveness of others in the same class.“There is a very clear link between ceftiofur use and ceftriaxone resistance,” said Paul Fey, a professor of microbiology at University of Nebraska Medical Center. “We know that ceftiofur-resistant salmonella are clearly ceftriaxone-resistant.”ECONOMIC INCENTIVES Despite the perils, there are economic incentives to misuse ceftiofur.

18,"  (Corrects second paragraph to say ""scholarships funded by Merck, Zoetis, Cargill and others this year."")By Duff Wilson and Mimi DwyerDec 23 The pharmaceutical industry has strong ties to veterinary education across the United States, providing financial support to professors, researchers and students.Zoetis, the world's leading animal drug maker, has given $3.6 million in scholarships over the past five years to more than 1,100 U.S. veterinary students. The American Association of Bovine Practitioners, a beef veterinary group, provided $300,000 in grants and scholarships funded by Merck, Zoetis, Cargill and others this year.A four-year veterinary education costs well over $200,000, and students often leave school with significant debt. But five pharmaceutical companies have donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to help veterinary students pay back loans. One condition: that the students practice food-animal medicine for four years. Some students also are paid to serve as representatives of pharmaceutical companies on their campuses. ""I don't think they're pushing anything that's going to affect how we practice as veterinarians, but it certainly could be viewed that way,"" said Alexander Thomson, the Zoetis student representative at Cornell veterinary college. He declined to say how much he is paid.Leading veterinary professors are also accepting money from the pharmaceutical industry for everything from research to company-scripted promotional speaking. Such speaking arrangements are banned by many university medical faculties, according to Eric Campbell, a Harvard University professor who studies conflicts of interest between medical doctors and drug companies. ""The fact that they're being supported by the companies they're supposed to be overseeing raises issues about the impact of those payments,"" he said.Pamela Ruegg, a professor of dairy science at the University of Wisconsin, was paid to speak by Zoetis, among others. Then, she said, Zoetis stopped inviting her to forums when she voiced concerns that antibiotics were being overused on farms. ""They wouldn't sponsor me as a speaker because they're mad at me,"" Ruegg said. ""My message is we have to reduce the amount of antimicrobial use and use it properly."" Last week, however, Ruegg said a Zoetis representative called her to ask if the company could distribute a YouTube video she made and a paper she wrote advocating more ""watchful waiting"" and less antibiotic usage on dairy farms. ""It's a favorable development,"" she said. Zoetis declined to comment.Mark Papich, a professor of clinical pharmacology at North Carolina State's veterinary college, has received speaking and consulting fees, honoraria, research grants or gifts from nearly every pharmaceutical company, a fact he talks about openly.""It's a matter of survival for us to try and get support from the pharmaceutical companies,"" he said.

The sources asked not to be named because they are not permitted to discuss them publicly. Two of the sources said Zoetis may increase the size of its board from nine to 11 to accommodate the Pershing Square representatives, and said the new board members could push for better cost controls and ultimately a sale to another firm. The sources said that the two sides are still interviewing candidates.Zoetis and Pershing Square declined to comment. Ackman's approach to Zoetis is similar to increasingly popular strategies chosen by other powerful activist investors like Carl Icahn and Nelson Peltz, who have been quietly demanding changes at companies around the board room table.Some of Ackman's past moves have been marked by more fiery public campaigns, including his efforts to convince Botox maker Allergan Inc. to sell to rival Valeant Pharmaceuticals last year. Pershing Square was the biggest owner in Allergan, making a bet that turned out to be his firm's most profitable to date even though Allergan refused to combine with Valeant and sold itself instead to Actavis Plc. Pershing Square had no board seats at Allergan.Two sources said a Pershing Square contingent on the new Zoetis board could push for a sale of Zoetis in due time. Valeant has been mentioned by industry investors as a possible buyer even though Valeant's chief executive, Michael Pearson, has denied interest in Zoetis. They said that one of the new Zoetis board members would likely be Pershing Square partner and Ackman business school friend William Doyle, who introduced the billionaire investor to Pearson before the Allergan bet.Doyle is a former McKinsey & Co. consultant with a science background who as a board member could provide valuable insight into possible suitors who might want to bid for Zoetis down the line, one of the sources said.Shares of Zoetis, which has a market capitalization of $22 billion, have gained 38 percent during the company's less than two-year lifetime. Ackman's past shows he's willing to wait for a bigger payoff. He held a stake in liquor company BEAM for 3-1/2 years, for example, before it was taken over a year ago by Suntory, yielding him a 72 percent gain.     In a letter to clients late last year, Ackman called Zoetis a ""scarce asset"" and compared it to BEAM.Pershing Square, which was one of the top-performing large hedge funds in 2014, with a 38 percent return, is to hold its annual investor dinner in New York on Thursday. Some more discussion of the Zoetis investment, code-named ""Superman"" by Ackman's team before the investment became public, is possible.

25,"  (Adds comment from Zoetis Inc, paragraph 9)By Tom PolansekCHICAGO, March 23 The U.S. government is developing a vaccine to protect poultry from new strains of avian flu that have recently killed birds from Arkansas to Washington state.Within two months, scientists at a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) research lab in Georgia will test the vaccine on chickens to see how well it prevents them from getting sick and dying of the virus, which the government says is spread by wild birds.Progress toward creating a vaccine has not previously been reported. It comes after the H5N8 and H5N2 flu strains have infected commercial poultry operations and backyard flocks in eight states since December. In response to the cases, key overseas buyers have limited imports of U.S. poultry, and the world's biggest poultry producers, including Tyson Foods Inc and Sanderson Farms Inc, have increased biosecurity at farms.The government has no plans to distribute the vaccine yet, officials said on Monday. Instead, the United States will continue to cull infected flocks and test nearby birds to prevent transmission. The United States is developing the vaccine in case it needs a countermeasure to the containment strategy, said T.J. Myers, associate deputy director of surveillance, preparedness, and response services for the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The agency will ultimately decide whether to release the vaccine.The new strains have been found in wild birds that can carry the virus so ""there's really no way to predict where the next case might be,"" Myers said. Vaccinating all poultry nationwide is not considered practical or necessary, he added. Use of a vaccine may be considered if avian flu ""gets to the point where we cannot contain it,"" said Mark Jackwood, head of the University of Georgia's Department of Population Health.Zoetis Inc, the world's largest animal-health company, said it was in contact with USDA about the flu infections. The company has a vaccine approved for use in countries outside the United States.The U.S. Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory, which is working on the new vaccine, tested the effectiveness of an existing vaccine on the new strains. It did not perform as well as scientists wanted, Director David Swayne said.Separately, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is preparing to respond if birds transmit the flu to humans, said Michael Jhung, a medical officer for the influenza division. The risk for human infection is considered low.

39,"   By Danny Na and Tom Polansek  Dec 14 Animal-nutritionist John Goihl knows Minnesota farmers who feed the remains of dead baby pigs to hogs used for breeding in attempts to ward off infections of a deadly virus in offspring.In Oklahoma, farm workers are mixing manure from swine sick with the disease, known as Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus (PEDv), into the food of healthy animals to build their immunity.In Kansas, farmers are spraying a mixture of hog manure containing the virus and water on the noses of pigs to create a ""natural vaccine.""Across the Farm Belt, U.S. pork producers are doing whatever they can to shore up their herds' defences against the virus that killed up to 8 million pigs, a tenth of the nation's herd, two years ago, and that farmers fear could return this winter.The virus, which causes severe diarrhea that kills baby pigs, thrives in cold weather, and declining immunity in the U.S. herd has raised the risk of another outbreak to the highest level since 2013, when pork prices soared to record highs, veterinarians said. A resurgence could drive up prices again and hurt profits for processors including Tyson Foods and JBS USA, which have benefited from low hog prices.Farmers are better prepared to fight the disease than they were two years ago after implementing procedures to prevent the spread of the virus via farm vehicles, workers' shoes and animal feed. Veterinarians said that attempts to deliberately expose hogs to the virus also help reduce the risk of an outbreak as big as the one that began in 2013, although it is not clear how many farmers are taking such precautions.Michael Blackwell, chief veterinarian officer for the Humane Society of the United States, said feeding baby pigs to other hogs ""seems to be pretty barbaric,"" but that he understands why farmers are doing it. ""It is not as inhumane as having millions of piglets killed in an outbreak,"" he said. VACCINES AND ""FEEDBACK"" Veterinarians said commercial vaccines available from Zoetis Inc and Merck & Co-owned Harrisvaccines offer limited help preventing outbreaks. They do not specifically target the gut and are mainly effective on hogs that have already been exposed to the virus. Harrisvaccines said that vaccines are not a ""silver bullet,"" and Zoetis said there was not enough data that prove that vaccines effectively protect herds that have not previously been infected.Such limitations, along with concerns that immunity levels have waned, make farmers turn to methods such as ""feedback,"" where intestines of piglets killed by the virus are fed to female pigs used for breeding. Immunity has declined because a growing number of hogs have never been infected, meaning they lack natural immunity they could pass on to their babies, veterinarians say. Also, immunity wears off over time in hogs that were previously infected.Feedback allows female hogs to become infected and pass on immunity to piglets, which are more likely to die from the disease than older hogs. Those fed infected food or otherwise exposed to the virus usually become sick for a few days, but then get well again.Purposefully exposing hogs to the virus is ""really important because that's one way we can have local establishment and local building of immunity,"" said Lisa Becton, director of swine health information and research for the National Pork Board, an industry group. Matt Ackerman, a prominent hog veterinarian based in Indiana, estimates that more than a million pigs could die between June 1, 2015 and May 31, 2016, from a return of the virus, far below the 2013 levels. Such losses would occur if 10 percent of sow farms become infected, which Ackerman said was a ""very real expectation"" that would be devastating to producers.From July 1 to Dec. 4, 2 percent of herds cumulatively reported new infections, according to an analysis from Bob Morrison, a professor at the University of Minnesota. That is down from 56 percent between July 2013 and June 2014 and 9 percent a year later.For farmers seeking to deliberately expose their herds to the virus, one step is to identify infected hogs, so they can serve as ""vaccine"" donors. At Prestage Farms in Oklahoma, which sells hogs to Seaboard Corp, workers place pieces of rope into pig pens for hogs to bite. The rope is then tested for the virus, says Ron Prestage, who runs a division of the family-owned company.If the disease is detected, workers scoop up manure from the pens to mix with feed for female breeding hogs, so they can pass on antibodies to piglets through their milk, said Prestage, who is also president of the National Pork Producers Council.""They get a little bit of a belly ache and have diarrhea and then get over it,"" he said.(Reporting by Danny Na and Tom Polansek in Chicago; Editing by Tomasz Janowski)",2015-12-14,ZTS,"Mon Dec 14, 2015 | 4:00am EST","US hogs fed pig remains, manure to fend off deadly virus return",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-hogs-virus-idUSL1N13Q38620151214?type=companyNews

47,"   By Lawrence Delevingne and Svea Herbst-Bayliss | LAS VEGAS  LAS VEGAS Hedge fund managers on Thursday named some of their recent investments, including a bet that shares of American Airlines Group (AAL.O) would fall and shares of both Chinese Internet company Tencent (0700.HK) and chipmaker Xilinx (XLNX.O) would rise, in addresses at one of the industry's most prominent conferences.John Lykouretzos, who runs $2.8 billion Hoplite Capital Management Lp, disclosed his negative case against American Airlines, which helped push the stock down as much as 4.7 percent on Thursday. Calling the company the ""most compelling short in the U.S. airline industry,"" Lykouretzos said American's costs are too high, that it is the most exposed airline to rising oil prices, and it has the highest leverage compared to its peers.An American airlines spokesman, Josh Freed, responding to Lykouretzos, referred Reuters to recent comments from Chief Executive Doug Parker on a company earnings call.Parker on that call said American was “purchasing our shares because we are bullish on the stock,"" and said “the industry is well undervalued,"" adding, ""We think American Airlines has more upside than anyone else in the industry.”Lykouretzos was one of a handful of prominent managers speaking at the annual SkyBridge Alternatives Conference in Las Vegas, four months into a difficult year where the average hedge fund has lost money and some big-name investors are rethinking their commitment to them.The managers did not provide details on when they invested in particular companies or at what price. Fears about a possible recession in the United States and slower growth in China have contributed to unpredictable markets that have left many managers nursing losses.But there are still good opportunities, the managers told the conference where about 2,000 investors, managers and others crowded in to hear who is picking what.John Burbank, who runs $4.1 billion Passport Capital and has often invested abroad, said he is betting on Tencent, calling it the ""dominant Internet play"" with six of the most popular smart-phone apps.Clifton Robbins of $3.5 billion Blue Harbour Group said he likes Xilinx and was buying more as recently as Thursday. He noted that the company has some $2 billion in cash and said the stock is undervalued, which would make a case for the company buying back some of its own stock. Activist investors like Blue Harbour have called on many chief executives to buy back their own stock. Robbins also said Xilinx is the last independent chip company after Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Altera merged. Xilinx's unique standing could prompt takeover bids, he said. Jim Chanos, who runs Kynikos Associates and built his reputation on a successful bet against Enron, spoke again about his short play on Cheniere Energy Inc (LNG.A), saying the stock is still ""crazy expensive.""Burbank said he's betting against large Chinese companies via the iShares China Large-Cap ETF to hedge out some of what he called ""old China risk.""Meanwhile, Scott Ferguson, who runs $4 billion Sachem Head Capital Management, said his activist firm exited its bet on animal healthcare company Zoetis Inc (ZTS.N) in the first quarter. Sachem brought the idea on Zoetis to the attention of Pershing Square's William Ackman and both made an investment in 2014. Ferguson said his fund had made money on the bet and Zoetis was very responsive to the activists' suggestions, but it was time to move on and find other opportunities.Pershing Square recently reduced its holding in Zoetis.Teresa Barger, chief executive officer of Cartica Management, repeated that her firm is invested in Taiwanese company Voltronic Power (6409.TW).Jeff Smith of Starboard Value spoke again about his firm's most prominent investment, Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O). Starboard recently reached an agreement with Yahoo under which Starboard will get board seats. Smith said his job as a new board member is to improve the strength of Yahoo's core business.

57,"   By Marcus E. Howard | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Americans' attachment to their pets has fostered a $60 billion industry that is producing best-in-breed stock performance. Shares of a clutch of companies that sell pet food, develop diagnostic tests for animals and offer veterinary care have far outrun the wider market this year, delivering an average total return of nearly 35 percent versus around 8.3 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500 .SPX. Shares of animal health testing company Idexx Laboratories Inc (IDXX.O), for example, have skyrocketed more than 50 percent this year, while vet clinic operator VCA Inc (WOOF.O) is up 31 percent and pet food maker Blue Buffalo Pet Products Inc (BUFF.O) is up 40 percent.""What you see driving that growth is the humanization of pets and consumers' willingness to spend on their pets very heavily,"" said Joe Edelstein, an analyst at Stephens Inc. ""Part of that is because pets are part of the family.""Edelstein follows Blue Buffalo and rival Freshpet Inc (FRPT.O), which is up 25 percent in 2016. Last year, U.S. pet-related spending totaled a record $60.3 billion, a 3.9 percent increase over the previous year, according to the American Pet Products Association.According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. consumers' spending on their pets rose 5 percent in inflation-adjusted terms last year while overall consumer spending rose 3.2 percent. It was the fourth straight year that growth in spending on pet services and products exceeded growth of consumer spending overall.Blue Buffalo and Freshpet are representative of the success of pet food, the industry's leading source of revenue, and are making the most of the trend toward natural, locally sourced ingredients.  ""We see continued growth of 'better-for-them' pet food products in both cat and dog,"" said Phil Terpolilli, a Wedbush Securities analyst. ""Adoptions in U.S. dogs continue to grow meaningfully.""PRICED TO PURR-FECTION?  The surge in the stock prices has lifted price-to-earnings ratios for the group, leaving investors to wonder just how much further the puppies have to run. Idexx shares now trade at about 43 times analysts' estimates of its earnings for the next 12 months, their highest level in about 20 years. It is not alone. The comparable price-to-earnings multiple of Heska Corp (HSKA.O), a maker of animal lab testing products, is 41 compared with a five-year median of 35. VCA's is 22.6 versus a five-year median of 16.8. Blue Buffalo and Freshpet, which both have fewer than two years on the public market, trade at multiples of 31 and 115, respectively.Big investors appear to be staying put, though. A review of the top 20 shareholders in eight companies in the pet market at the end of the second quarter showed that a majority added to or retained their positions in those stocks.Only Heska saw more of its top investors pare back positions than add to them, although none of the changes were large. Its shares are up 30 percent this year. ""We continually look at our names, the results and our expectations, and as long as we think they warrant the multiple that we've paid for the stock, we're going to be owners,"" said     Jarl Ginsberg, portfolio manager of the Columbia Small/Mid Cap Value Fund that owns shares of VCA, the vet clinic chain.One company that may catch the eye of investors is Zoetis Inc (ZTS.N), one of the world's largest animal health companies and the weakest performer of the group this year.Shares of the company, which spun off from Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) in 2013, have gained around 7 percent so far this year. But they do not feature the same valuation risks, trading at about 24 times estimated earnings for the next 12 months, just above the long-term median of 22.8.Zoetis is increasing its earnings and revenues well above broader pet healthcare spending trends, said investor James Tierney Jr., chief investment officer at money manager AB's Concentrated US Growth fund.""This is a company that should post 14 percent earnings growth over the 2013 to 2017 time frame,"" he said.
