0,"   By Ryan Vlastelica | NEW YORK, Sept 12  NEW YORK, Sept 12 Hertz Global and Ulta Salon Cosmetics were among the biggest premarket movers on Friday, with both companies rallying on heavy volume.Shares of Hertz gained 4.6 percent to $29.03 a day after billionaire investor Carl Icahn won three board seats at the car renter. He said he would not run a proxy contest against the company as a result. The news came less than a month after Icahn announced a stake of 8.7 percent in the company.With the gain implied by the premarket move, Hertz will turn positive for the year on Friday. It is currently down 3 percent in 2014. Ulta Salon jumped 16 percent to $112.98 a day after it raised its full-year view for both same-store sales and earnings. On Friday, several analysts raised their price target on the stock, including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.The stock has struggled for direction over the past two years, dipping 1.8 percent over 2013 but rising less than 1 percent thus far in 2014. Friday's move is on track to be the biggest one-day advance for Ulta since September 2013.Futures snapshot at 7:32 a.m. EDT (1132 GMT): * S&P 500 e-minis flat, with 85,698 contracts changing hands.* Nasdaq 100 e-minis down 1.5 points, or 0.04 percent, in volume of 9,324 contracts.* Dow e-minis up 2 points, or 0.01 percent, with 6,356 contracts changing hands.

Yellen is due to speak at an event hosted by Harvard University at 1:15 p.m. ET (1715 GMT).A rate increase in June was seen as highly unlikely until recently. However, the Fed funds futures are now pricing in a 25 percent chance of a rate hike in June and 45 percent in July after a string of strong data and comments from Fed officials.The Fed next meets on June 14-15.""I think Yellen's speech on June 6 would be a better indicator for when the next rate hike will come because by then we'll have the May unemployment data too,"" said Tim Dreiling,  regional investment director at U.S. Bank's Private Client Reserve. ""While there is plenty to be happy about with regard to the economic data, the strong dollar will continue to put pressure on manufacturers, and I'd still like to see some growth in earnings.""At 11:00 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones industrial average  was up 22.29 points, or 0.13 percent, at 17,850.58, the S&P 500  was up 4.44 points, or 0.21 percent, at 2,094.54 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 17.27 points, or 0.35 percent, at 4,919.04.Eight of the 10 major S&P sectors were higher, with the consumer discretionary and health indexes leading the gainers.AbbVie's 1.7 percent rise boosted the health index, while Ulta Salon Cosmetics and Fragrance's 9 percent jump lifted the consumer discretionary index. Data on Friday showed the U.S. economic growth slowed in the first quarter although not as sharply as initially thought.Gross domestic product rose at a 0.8 percent annual rate as opposed to the 0.5 percent pace reported last month - the slowest growth since the first quarter of 2015. Economists polled by Reuters expected a 0.9 percent growth rate.Wall Street closed mostly flat on Thursday as investors took a breather following two days of strong gains.Cyber security firm Palo Alto's shares were down 12.2 percent at $130 after posting a wider-than-expected quarterly loss.GameStop fell 6.3 percent to $28.08 after the video-game retailer forecast lower-than-expected revenue and profit for the current quarter.Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,758 to 1,064. On the Nasdaq, 1,639 issues rose and 900 fell.The S&P 500 index showed 17 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 43 new highs and 12 new lows.
