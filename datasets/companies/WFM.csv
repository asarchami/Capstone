0,"   By Eric Beech | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Leaders of the House and Senate agriculture committees are optimistic that the long-overdue U.S. farm bill will pass, although the House of Representatives vote set for Wednesday could be the more difficult hurdle.House Agriculture Committee Chairman Frank Lucas said on a conference call with reporters on Tuesday that there are a number of House members - both liberal and conservative - who are opposed to sprawling legislation unveiled on Monday by congressional negotiators.""I've always known that the folks at both ends of the spectrum would not support us,"" said Lucas, an Oklahoma Republican. ""It's the coalition of the folks in the middle who want to get things done ... who will pass this bill.""""If it was easy, it wouldn't be the farm bill,"" he added.Lucas said liberal members objected to cuts of about 1 percent a year in funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, which provides assistance for low-income Americans to buy food.The cut was double what was proposed in the farm bill passed last year by the Democratic-led Senate.At the same time, many conservatives thought the savings in the overall bill, an estimated $23 billion to $24 billion compared with current funding, wasn't enough.Separately, a report by the Congressional Budget Office on Tuesday estimated that farm bill savings would total $16.6 billion over the 10 years starting in 2014 - less than lawmakers had contended.Conservative pressure groups Heritage Action and Club for Growth urged a ""no"" vote on the bill on Tuesday and said they would include the results in their scorecards of members' voting records for 2014.House members on Tuesday took a procedural vote that clears the way for a farm bill debate and final vote on Wednesday. Senate Agriculture Committee Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow sounded more confident about the vote in the Democrat-run Senate, which could come as early as next week. There is a ""strong bipartisan coalition"" supporting the bill, she said.Both Lucas and Stabenow said they had ""every indication"" from the White House that President Barack Obama would sign the bill.KEEPING MEAT ""COOL"" Monday's agreement on the legislation came after lawmakers spent months ironing out differences over food stamps, crop insurance, farm subsidies and other issues contained in earlier House and Senate legislation.Although farm bills are written every five years, the CBO considered the 10-year costs of the legislation, which it said would total $956 billion. Of that, $756 billion could be for nutrition programs including SNAP. Much of the modest savings identified by the CBO would come from an end to so-called direct payment subsidies, which for years have been made to farmers and landowners regardless of need.Those payments would disappear from 2015, saving some $4.5 billion a year. But the savings are largely offset by spending on various forms of crop insurance coverage.Despite last-minute lobbying from the meat industry, so-called country of origin labeling (COOL) remained in the bill. The provision requires meat to be labeled as to where animals are born, grown and processed.COOL backers, including consumer groups and ranchers, say consumers have a right to know where their meat originates. U.S. meatpackers say the law imposes unnecessary costs on the industry and violates free trade provisions.""The votes were not there"" in either the House or Senate to repeal COOL, Stabenow said. Lucas said removing the labeling law could have endangered agreement on the full bill.Another contentious issue put to rest on Monday was an amendment from Republican Representative Steve King of Iowa that was intended to block a California law requiring that all eggs sold in the state come from chickens kept in non-confining cages.The King amendment passed in the House, but Stabenow said it was dropped from the final bill in light of ""overwhelming opposition"" among the House-Senate negotiators.Animal welfare advocates, state legislators and others had decried the amendment.King said California violated the interstate commerce clause of the Constitution. Opponents said it could have broader consequences beyond California and invalidate hundreds of state laws on animal protection and food safety.U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in November that the amendment ""would create legal challenges and confusion in the marketplace.""Several large U.S. farm groups urged swift passage of the legislation.""This bill provides funding for important programs in conservation, research and trade that help keep America's wheat industry productive and competitive on a global scale,"" said Bing Von Bergen, a wheat farmer from Moccasin, Montana, who is president of the National Association of Wheat Growers.(Reporting by Eric Beech; Editing by Ros Krasny, Jan Paschal and Leslie Adler)",2014-01-28,WFM,"Tue Jan 28, 2014 | 6:27pm EST","House, Senate leaders see swift passage of US farm bill",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-agriculture-farmbill-idUSBREA0Q1UI20140128?type=companyNews

For example, in Los Angeles' waterfront community of Marina Del Rey, mainstream grocer Kroger Co's (KR.N) Ralphs market has sold packaged, organic kale and Aidells HSH.N artisan sausages at lower prices than a nearby Whole Foods store.Elsewhere, Wal-Mart's U.S. division plans to introduce 100 Wild Oats-branded organic products ranging from olive oil to canned black beans in half of its 4,000 stores in coming months. Walmart, which caters to lower income shoppers and sells more groceries than other retailers, said those products would be priced on par with conventional rivals and at least 25 percent below branded organic foods.Mackey said that Whole Foods continues to gain share as organics move from niche to mainstream and would strive to lead the sector. Whole Foods has already announced it would be the first U.S. retailer to commit to labeling or eliminating foods made with genetically modified ingredients.

They were up 4.3 percent for the six weeks ended May 4.

The Dow and the S&P 500 moved into positive territory after Yellen said the U.S. economy was still in need of lots of support, given the ""considerable slack"" in the labor market in remarks to the congressional Joint Economic Committee.Yellen's comments enabled investors to shift attention to what may be an easing of the tensions in Ukraine, as Russian President Vladimir Putin called on pro-Moscow separatists in Ukraine to postpone a vote on secession just five days before it was to be held.But the Nasdaq remained under pressure as stocks such as Amazon.com Inc, down 2.6 percent at $289.55; Facebook Inc, down 2.8 percent at $56.91; and Google Inc , down 1.6 percent at $514.31, all weighed heavily on the index. The Nasdaq has dropped more than 2 percent over the past two sessions. ""Janet Yellen didn't say anything new in her testimony. She continues to talk about how they are data dependent, how they can change on a dime, but she didn't say rates are going up any time soon, which is exactly what people expected,"" said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O'Neil Securities in New York.""Coupled with the fact that technically the market found some support, then (investors) started concentrating on what Putin said,"" Polcari added.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 92.48 points or 0.56 percent, to 16,493.50.

Whole Foods Market Inc also contributed to the Nasdaq's decline as the organic grocer's stock tumbled 19 percent to $38.82. The stock was the biggest drag on both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes a day after Whole Foods posted second-quarter results and cut its 2014 outlook.

18,"   By Lewis Krauskopf and Lisa Baertlein | NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES  NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES Rebecca Sumrow is one of the customers food and restaurant company executives have in mind when they consider raising prices to offset higher costs as meat and milk soar to record highs.The 30-year-old from San Clemente, California, was out of work for a short time last year and saved money by moving in with her boyfriend and cutting back on clothes shopping and dining out. Though she now has a good job working for an investment firm, she's maintaining her frugal ways.Consumers ""have gotten really good over these last four years at stretching a penny,"" said Pat Conroy, leader of the U.S. consumer products practice at Deloitte LLP. Referring to the recession, he said, ""Our hypothesis was that this thing was going to leave a scar, not a bruise. So far, we've been right.""According to Deloitte's annual survey of food shoppers released last week, 94 percent agreed they would remain cautious and keep spending at the same level even if the economy improves. That's about the same percentage as it was in 2010 in the aftermath of the credit crisis.So Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N), McDonald's Corp (MCD.N), Hillshire Brands Co HSN.N and Kraft Foods Group Inc KRFT.O, all of which are raising prices, will be trying to retain consumers stuck with stagnant incomes and unhappy memories of the recession. Faced with little choice but to boost prices to cover the spike in costs for products like milk and meat, companies often are taking extra care to justify or soften the increases.COLD CUTS AND BACON Kraft has raised, or will soon increase, prices on about 45 percent of the products in its portfolio, including cheese, cold cuts and bacon. Hillshire raised the prices on Jimmy Dean sausage and Ball Park hot dogs as retail pork prices hit a record high of $1.99 a pound in March, from $1.40 a pound a year ago, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. McDonald's eliminated its ""dollar menu"" last year to give it flexibility to raise prices to offset high costs for meat and other ingredients.Chipotle is one of the few companies expected to have the power to raise prices due to its popularity with higher income diners. The burrito chain is increasing menu prices this quarter, but only after giving customers a benefit by removing almost all food ingredients made with genetically modified organisms, or GMOs. ""You're hearing that they want to, but the question always becomes: Can it stick?"" said Prudential Financial market strategist Quincy Krosby, referring to raising prices. ""What the consumer has been very good about is going on strike.""That's happening now in the dairy aisle. As U.S. milk prices go up, shoppers buy less, according to Dean Foods Co (DF.N), the largest U.S. milk processor. Fluid milk industry volumes fell 2.1 percent in the first quarter, according to Dean.""There are certain price thresholds that we can't cross, or it starts to impact the demand,"" Dean Chief Executive Gregg Tanner said on a conference call with analysts last week. ""We experienced additional softness in our volumes during March and April.""The wholesale price for beverage milk was about $2.10 per gallon in May, a record, and up 38 percent from a year ago, according to dairy analyst Jerry Dryer. In March, retail milk prices were up only 6.5 percent, suggesting that retailers are eating much of the cost increase, he said.INFLATION TARGET  U.S. consumer prices rose 1.5 percent in March from the year earlier, led by food and housing rental costs. An index of inflation tracked by the Federal Reserve is running even lower at 1.2 percent, against the central bank's target of a 2 percent inflation rate.Many consumers are still struggling in a tough labor market. Labor force participation remains depressed. Private-sector wages were unchanged in April and over the past 12 months have averaged monthly increases of just 0.16 percent.""There's still a large swath of the population that just doesn't have the spending power,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.Pricing issues already have changed the fortunes of Whole Foods Market Inc (WFM.O) and McDonald's, which are battling rivals that emerged from the recession willing to start price wars. McDonald's raised prices late last year in a bid to protect profits from higher meat costs. Its customers, who tend to earn less than those who frequent Chipotle, voted with their feet and U.S. sales at established restaurants have not posted a monthly gain since October.Whole Foods, the leading natural and organic grocer nicknamed ""Whole Paycheck"" because of a perception among some consumers of high prices, has seen same-store sales growth cool as mainstream food sellers add more organics and undercut it on price.Its most aggressive rival could be Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), which in the United States will introduce 100 Wild Oats-branded organic packaged food products ranging from olive oil to black beans in about 2,000 stores in coming months.Walmart, which tends to cater to lower-income shoppers and sells more groceries than any other domestic retailer, said those products would be priced on par with conventional rivals and at least 25 percent below branded organic foods.""It's really hard for Whole Foods to start a price war. It's really easy for Walmart,"" said Wolfe Research retail analyst Scott Mushkin.For her part, Sumrow says she's spending more time in the dollar store produce aisles and less time in upscale places like Whole Foods, though she still splurges on things like unpasteurized milk for about $6 a gallon and fresh spinach, kale and chard for her daily juicing ritual. She's not inclined to loosen up her spending anytime soon, even though she's making more money.""We have to be very careful with our finances to be able to get anywhere,"" she said, adding that neither she nor her sister plan to have children because it doesn't make financial sense. ""We have to tighten our belts and invest wisely and try to get established when everything is working against us.""(Additional reporting by Lisa Richwine in Los Angeles, Theopolis Waters in Chicago and Lucia Mutikani in Washington; Editing by Jilian Mincer and John Pickering)",2014-05-14,WFM,"Wed May 14, 2014 | 8:17am EDT",Frugal U.S. consumers make it tough for food companies to raise prices,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-prices-food-analysis-idUSBREA4D03X20140514?type=companyNews

The newspaper said that Bed Bath & Beyond, the New Jersey-based home goods company that has seen shares fall 26 percent this year, is a prime candidate for a buyout. Office supplies retailer Staples, meanwhile, could see its shares rise 45 percent. While the company appears to be out of favor because of its footprint of physical stores, it boasts the third-largest online retail business behind Amazon and Apple, Barron's said. Whole Foods has growth ahead of it, according to the newspaper, despite its stock falling 35 percent this year.

26,"   By Lucia Mutikani | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. consumer prices rose in June as the cost of gasoline surged, but the underlying trend remained consistent with a gradual build-up of inflationary pressures.The Labor Department said on Tuesday its Consumer Price Index increased 0.3 percent last month, with gasoline accounting for two-thirds of the gain, after May's 0.4 percent rise. In the 12 months through June, the CPI increased 2.1 percent after a similar rise in May.Inflation is creeping up as the economy's recovery becomes more durable, a welcome development for some Federal Reserve officials who had worried that price pressures were too low.The steady increases have led some economists to predict that a separate inflation gauge watched by the Fed, currently running below the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target, could breach that target by year-end as an acceleration in job growth lifts wages.Fed Chair Janet warned last week the Fed could raise interest rates sooner and more rapidly than currently envisioned if the labor market continued to improve faster than anticipated by policymakers.  The dollar reversed losses against the euro on the data, while U.S. stock index futures extended gains. Prices for U.S. Treasury debt trimmed losses.Last month's increase in the CPI was in line with economists' expectations. Gasoline prices jumped 3.3 percent, the largest rise in a year, after increasing 0.7 percent in May. While prices for electricity also rose, they slowed from May's brisk 2.3 percent increase. Food prices edged up 0.1 percent in June, the smallest rise since January Food prices have now advanced for six straight months. A drought in California last year has been pushing up prices, but the momentum is ebbing. Prices for dairy products, cereals, fruit and vegetables fell last month. The index for meats, poultry, fish and eggs rose, however.    Stripping out food and energy prices, the so-called core CPI rose 0.1 percent, slowing after May's 0.3 percent increase. In the 12 months through June, the core CPI increased 1.9 percent after rising 2.0 percent rise in May. Economists had forecast the core CPI rising 0.2 percent from May and 2.0 percent from a year-ago.The core CPI was held back by declines in prices for new motor vehicles and used trucks. The cost of shelter moderated a bit as did airline fares and medical care services, which were flat. There were big increases in tobacco prices and the cost of household furnishing and operations rose for the first time in a year.

27,"  WASHINGTON U.S. consumer prices barely rose in July as declining energy costs partially offset increases in food and rents, which could give the Federal Reserve ammunition to keep interest rates low for a while.  The Labor Department said on Tuesday its Consumer Price Index edged up 0.1 percent last month after increasing 0.3 percent in June. In the 12 months through July, the CPI increased 2.0 percent after advancing 2.1 percent in June. Inflation pushed up a bit from March through June, but labor market slack, marked by tepid wage growth, is keeping a lid on price pressures. That could add to the view that the U.S. central bank will be in no hurry to raise its benchmark interest rate.The Fed targets 2 percent inflation and it tracks an index that is running even lower than the CPI.  The Fed last month said the risk of inflation running persistently below its target had diminished somewhat. It has kept its overnight lending rate near zero since December 2008 while nursing the economy back to health.Last month's gain in consumer prices was in line with economists' expectations. Energy prices fell broadly after rising in each of the last three months. Gasoline prices fell 0.3 percent last month after surging 3.3 percent in June. Food prices increased 0.4 percent after rising 0.1 percent in June. A drought in California is driving up food prices.Stripping out food and energy prices, the so-called core CPI ticked up 0.1 percent after a similar gain in June. In the 12 months through July, the core CPI increased 1.9 percent after rising by the same margin in June.  The core CPI was held back by declining prices for used trucks and a plunge in airline fares. There was a moderate increase in the cost of prescription medication. Rents rose 0.3 percent in July and prices for new motor vehicles rebounded 0.3 percent.

49,"  * New Switzerland buying entity will open in June* Company hires ex-Volcafe trader as lead coffee buyer* Former coffee buyer leaves for Whole Foods' AllegroBy Luc CohenNEW YORK, May 6 Keurig Green Mountain  will begin purchasing green coffee out of its new Switzerland office in June, a spokeswoman told Reuters on Wednesday, a move that has prompted a reshuffling of the coffee buying team of the largest U.S. roaster by sales.Late last year, Reuters reported that the Waterbury, Vermont-based coffee roaster and brewing technology maker had formed a new corporate entity in Switzerland, home to commodity heavyweights like Glencore and Trafigura, for its procurement operations.The company said at the time that the new buying office would open in the spring of 2015. A ""small"" group of the U.S. team, including Lindsey Bolger, the company's vice president for coffee sourcing and excellence, will make the move to Lausanne, Switzerland, spokeswoman Sandy Yusen said.Bolger, who has been with Green Mountain since 2001, will lead the new operation. Green Mountain will also hire new staff, she said.Bolger will be joined by new lead buyer Urs Stuker, who started at Green Mountain in March from Be Green Trading SA, a Lausanne-based trader and risk management consultant, according to his LinkedIn page. Stuker previously was a coffee trader with Volcafe, the coffee wing of London-based commodities trader ED&F Man .One coffee buyer, Stacy Bocskor, left Green Mountain in February ahead of the move after almost 10 years with the company, according to her LinkedIn page.She has taken a job at Thornton, Colorado-based Allegro Coffee, owned by supermarket giant Whole Foods. Bocskor, Stuker and Bolger did not respond to requests for comment.Switzerland is home to the buying operations for rival coffee roasters like Starbucks and Nestle.The new entity, Keurig Trading GmbH, will be located near Starbucks Coffee Trading Company GmbH in Lausanne, according to the Canton of Vaud's business registry.In 2013, Green Mountain became the largest U.S. coffee roaster by retail sales value with 19 percent market share, according to data from market research firm Euromonitor.It trailed J.M. Smucker Co, which owns Folger's, in terms of retail volume, though it led the industry in sales volume growth at 33 percent.Green Mountain shares have lost 16 percent this year and were trading slightly lower at $109.88 on Wednesday.

53,"   By Anjali Athavaley | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Small U.S. food manufacturers once toiled for decades to develop a critical mass of fans for their products. Now, an increasing number of privately-held players are going from garage to grocery store in fewer than five years thanks to an erosion of barriers to entry within the food industry.The trend is visible everywhere from gluten-free and organic foods to more traditional fare, according to interviews with half a dozen startups, as well as retailers and industry consultants.Contract manufacturers have made it easier for small companies to produce goods inexpensively, while the reach of digital advertising allows them to target consumers without big marketing budgets, industry experts said. More mass-market retailers want niche brands that shoppers view as healthier to drive traffic in stores, particularly as they face rising competition from natural food and specialty chains like Whole Foods Market Inc (WFM.O). “It’s never been easier in the history of food for a new organic company to get their products on shelves,” said Arjan Stephens, executive vice president of sales and marketing at Nature’s Path Foods. The privately-held organic breakfast cereal brand was founded in 1985 and took nearly two decades to gain traction with mainstream retailers. In the ice cream business, for example, sales of some major U.S. brands have faltered. But one beneficiary is a little-known frozen dessert company called Arctic Zero. The fat-free, lactose-free and gluten-free product originated out of a soft serve machine in a Temecula, California garage. Arctic Zero hit the retail big leagues in 2013 when it gained coveted space in the freezers of Kroger Co (KR.N) just three years after launch. It is now also available at Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), Whole Foods and on Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN.O).“Everyone has been looking for a ‘better for you’ alternative in ice cream,"" said Arctic Zero CEO Amit Pandhi. “There just hasn’t been any innovation until our brand came along."" Overall, small and midsize consumer goods companies have stolen $18 billion in U.S. sales, or 2 percentage points of share, away from large players since 2009, according to a March report by IRI and the Boston Consulting Group. In 2014 alone, they took 0.7 points of share from big manufacturers.Last year's U.S. sales of snack bars help illustrate the trend. According to Euromonitor International, giant food companies General Mills Inc (GIS.N) and Kellogg Co (K.N) had market share declines of 0.3 points and 1.9 points, respectively, compared with 2013. The privately-held Clif Bar & Co gained 1 percentage point during the period, and another small rival, Kind LLC, increased its share by 2.1 points.The pace of overall share gains is accelerating as small organic and natural food purveyors win more shelf space at mass-market stores.     “They’re able to really focus on a subset of consumers and subset of retailers, and win in those areas and use that as a platform to grow into mainstream areas,” said Dan Wald, a partner at Boston Consulting Group.     RISING COMPETITION  Talenti, a gelato maker that uses hormone-free milk and pure cane sugar, employed such a strategy shortly after beginning production in a 1,000 square foot factory in Dallas. In 2007, when gelato was still a new concept in U.S. supermarkets, the company approached natural food and specialty stores like Sprouts Farmers Market Inc (SFM.O), Whole Foods and Fairway Group Holdings Corp FWM.O. Once the frozen treat proved its success, Talenti pitched more mainstream chains like Publix Super Markets Inc and Kroger. “It was really an exercise in discipline and retail mapping,” said Talenti CEO Steve Gill. “The worst thing we could do was put it into a retail format that was not yet ready for it and have it fail.” Unilever Plc (ULVR.L) bought Talenti last year for an undisclosed sum.To be sure, getting on the shelves of a Target or Kroger isn’t easy, and competition for those spots is increasing. The number of companies exhibiting at Natural Products Expo West, a popular trade show where many food makers get noticed by buyers for retail chains, has increased 74 percent to 2,768 since 2005, according to New Hope Natural Media, the show’s organizers.  Major food companies are also waging a counter-offensive, dropping some artificial additives from their well-known brands, creating new products they say are healthier, and acquiring natural or organic food brands that have proven themselves. General Mills bought organic food maker Annie’s Inc, best known for its bunny-shaped macaroni and cheese, for $820 million in October. Hershey bought Krave, an upscale jerky company, in March. It didn’t disclose the price.      “We are certainly seeing that there is a pronounced consumer trend toward health and wellness alternatives,” Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) CEO Irene Rosenfeld said in an interview last month. The maker of Oreo cookies and Cadbury chocolate acquired Enjoy Life, an allergen-free food company, earlier this year. “As the world’s largest snacking company, it is our desire to be meeting those needs.”HOOPS AND HURDLES For the small food players, that makes getting the right placement on shelves critical. Steve Hersh, co-founder of Utmost Brands Inc, started selling the company’s GuS Grown-Up Soda to retailers out of his Subaru in 2003. A year later, single bottles of GuS were lost among other options in the aisles of Stop & Shop Supermarket Company LLC, which eventually stopped offering the product. GuS contains less sugar than the average soda and is marketed to adults. Retailers are now catching on to its appeal and giving it prime placement. “Now you go to a Wegmans or Food Emporium, you’re going to see our four packs on a four-foot (wide) shelf, and you’re going to go, ‘oh, that’s a brand,’ rather than three little bottles in a sea of soda,” Hersh said. Finding the right distributor can also help small players build scale. Months after GuS launched, Hersh was contacted by Big Geyser, a major beverage distributor in New York that helped get the soda into Whole Foods and Fairway.  Food makers may still have to jump through hoops to satisfy retailers. One hurdle is the fees that major stores charge food makers to gain shelf space, which can run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Retailers may waive such fees depending on the number of options in the category and the ability of a novel brand to draw shoppers. But they may also make companies change the packaging of the product, a potentially costly move. For instance, nutrition bar company Mediterra Inc received interest from Target Corp (TGT.N) to join a trial run of new brands in its stores. Target asked for the bars to be sold in a five pack that Mediterra didn’t offer. The company designed the new packs with the help of its contract manufacturer and produced them in about 45 days, said Paul Pruett, Mediterra’s CEO. The trial at Target concluded in April, and the product is no longer on the shelves. It did, though, raise the brand’s profile, and the bars will be sold in about 400 Kroger stores later this year, Pruett said. Small food makers do need to be aware of how demanding their often social-media savvy, health conscious consumers are, executives said. For example, Arctic Zero recently received requests to put a seal on the product to show it hasn’t been opened. Arctic Zero is discussing the move, which could cost a few hundred thousand dollars, with its contract manufacturers, CEO Pandhi said.    (Reporting by Anjali Athavaley; Editing by Michele Gershberg and Martin Howell)",2015-05-21,WFM,"Thu May 21, 2015 | 1:44am EDT","Small food makers on fast path to U.S. store shelves, threatening big producers",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-food-upstarts-insight-idUSKBN0O60FN20150521?type=companyNews

One hurdle is the fees that major stores charge food makers to gain shelf space, which can run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.Retailers may waive such fees depending on the number of options in the category and the ability of a novel brand to draw shoppers. But they may also make companies change the packaging of the product, a potentially costly move.For instance, nutrition bar company Mediterra Inc received interest from Target Corp to join a trial run of new brands in its stores.Target asked for the bars to be sold in a five pack that Mediterra didn't offer. The company designed the new packs with the help of its contract manufacturer and produced them in about 45 days, said Paul Pruett, Mediterra's CEO.The trial at Target concluded in April, and the product is no longer on the shelves. It did, though, raise the brand's profile, and the bars will be sold in about 400 Kroger stores later this year, Pruett said.Small food makers do need to be aware of how demanding their often social-media savvy, health conscious consumers are, executives said.For example, Arctic Zero recently received requests to put a seal on the product to show it hasn't been opened. Arctic Zero is discussing the move, which could cost a few hundred thousand dollars, with its contract manufacturers, CEO Pandhi said.

57,"  (Updates with more speech details, background on Whole Foods)By Sarah N. LynchWASHINGTON, June 25 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is working to propose new rules to simplify the voting process for contested corporate board elections by permitting the use of so-called universal proxy ballots, SEC Chair Mary Jo White said on Thursday.In remarks prepared for a speech in Chicago, White said she has directed staff to draft recommendations for new rules amid concerns that shareholders do not have a ""sufficient range of choice"" when voting in contested company elections.Currently, only shareholders who physically attend annual meetings are allowed to split their ticket in contested elections and vote for a mix of candidates nominated by company management and by large shareholders.If they vote by proxy, they can generally only support one slate - management's or the one nominated by shareholders. Shareholder advocates, as well as SEC Democratic Commissioner Kara Stein, have previously raised concerns about how this approach could limit shareholders and have called for rules to permit universal ballots so shareholders have more free choice.Earlier this year, the SEC convened a group of experts to discuss the topic at a roundtable and explore possible solutions to bolster shareholder participation in corporate elections.White said Thursday that while she is looking to proceed with rules on the subject, she also believes companies can still make progress without waiting for the SEC to act. ""Give meaningful consideration to using some form of a universal proxy ballot even though the proxy rules currently do not require it,"" she said.""If a company's or proponent's nominees gave their consent to appear on the other side's proxy card, then all shareholders would have the full range of voting options available to them.""White's speech comes in a year when the agency has been scrutinizing corporate election regulatory issues more broadly. In January, the SEC backpedaled on a staff ruling permitting natural and organic foods retailer Whole Foods Inc to exclude a shareholder proposal from its ballot on the grounds it was substantially similar to the company's.In announcing the turn-around, the SEC also said it would not weigh in on any disputes between shareholders and companies on dueling proposals until it could review its rules on the topic. [ID: nL1N0UW011]White said Thursday that review is still ongoing.She also discussed how the SEC could potentially develop future regulations governing when and how preliminary voting results could be disclosed, but she did not formally commit to proceeding with a rule.(Reporting by Sarah N.

62,"   By Lisa Baertlein  Whole Foods Market Inc (WFM.O) on Wednesday said same-store sales growth cooled again in the third quarter, hurt by competition and an overcharging scandal in its New York City stores, and its shares tumbled 11 percent in after-hours trade.The Austin, Texas-based chain's same-store sales, a closely watched performance gauge for retailers, were up just 1.3 percent for the quarter ended July 5, far less than the 2.8 percent gain expected by analysts polled by Consensus Metrix.Those sales rose 3.6 percent in the second quarter and 4.5 percent in the first quarter. The rapid deceleration is troubling for investors, who have wondered how long Whole Foods could maintain its grip on the natural and organic grocery category it pioneered and long dominated.Early this month, an investigation by New York's Department of Consumer Affairs found that Whole Foods charged too much for some prepackaged foods at the company's nine New York City stores. Executives, who have apologized to shoppers, said they are working to rebuild trust after national media attention hurt sales around the country. Third-quarter net income rose 2 percent to $154 million, or 43 cents per share, missing Wall Street's estimate.Whole Foods also dialed down its 2015 same-store sales forecast. It now expects growth in the low single digit percentages, versus its prior call for growth in the low to mid-single digit percentages.Its forecast for fourth-quarter earnings of 34 to 35 cents per share also fell short of analysts' estimate of 38 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   Executives in May attributed the slowdown to competition from mainstream and specialty retailers and ""severe cannibalization"" from the company's own stores in some areas.It is responding with a new chain of smaller markets that target Millennials and value-oriented shoppers.

68,"  * U.S. economic growth picked up in second quarter* Facebook, Whole Foods fall after results* US quarterly earnings over half way through* Dow down 0.08 pct, S&P down 0.07, Nasdaq up 0.34 pct   (Updates to afternoon)By Noel RandewichJuly 30 The S&P 500 was on track for its flattest session in two weeks on Thursday as investors digested ho-hum corporate earnings and new data showed that the economy grew more quickly in the second quarter.Procter & Gamble, Facebook and Whole Foods Market all fell after quarterly reports that left investors wanting more. U.S. economic growth accelerated in the June quarter as solid consumer spending offset a drag from weak business spending on equipment, suggesting steady momentum that could bring the Federal Reserve closer to hiking interest rates this year.With a mixed bag of corporate earnings over halfway through second-quarter reporting season and a sharp focus on when the Federal Reserve will begin raising interest rates from nearly zero, investors on Thursday saw few reasons to pay more for shares.""We've been stuck in a 3-percent band since almost the beginning of the year,"" said Warren West, principal at Greentree Brokerage Services in Philadelphia. ""There's nothing motivating investors to push it outside of that in either direction."" At 2:25 pm, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 0.08 percent at 17,736.66. The S&P 500 was 0.07 percent lower at 2,107.09 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.34 percent at 5,129.30.Five of the 10 major S&P sectors were lower with the energy index's 0.95 percent fall leading the decliners and a 0.66 percent rise in the utilities index leading gainers.With 64 percent of S&P 500 companies having reported second-quarter results, analysts expect overall earnings to edge up 1 percent and revenue to decline 3.6 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Valuations remain a concern. The S&P 500 is trading near 16.8 times forward 12-month earnings, above the 10-year median of 14.7 times, according to StarMine data.Companies scheduled to report during the day include Expedia , LinkedIn and Western Union after the close.Skechers USA jumped 15.6 percent as the sports shoe maker and retailer reported a better-than-expected rise in quarterly revenue.Procter & Gamble fell 3.9 percent, Facebook dropped 1.6 percent and Whole Foods slumped 12.4 percent.Declining issues edged advancing ones on the NYSE by 1.10 to 1.

79,"  (New throughout, adds executive comments from conference call)By Lisa BaertleinNov 4 Big changes are coming to Whole Foods Market Inc as the natural and organic grocery pioneer revamps its pricing and modernizes its business to fend off widespread competition and bolster same-store sales, which unexpectedly fell in the latest quarter.The same-store sales drop hit shares, which fell 6.2 percent to $28.86 in extended trading.In a call after the earnings release, Whole Foods executives laid out plans to shake the chain's high-price ""Whole Paycheck"" reputation without sacrificing its position as a high-quality retailer.""Some would say that increasingly everyone is selling the same food and that price is all that matters,"" co-Chief Executive John Mackey said on a conference call with analysts. ""We are going to be competitive on price where we need to be, but, first and foremost, the Whole Foods Market brand stands for the highest quality, selection, and service,"" Mackey said.The Austin, Texas-based chain, whose mainstream competition includes retailers such as Kroger Co, Wal-Mart Stores Inc  and Trader Joe's, plans to launch a chain of smaller, more value-focused stores next year.Existing efforts to lower prices at Whole Foods have squeezed profits at the chain, which recently cut more than 2,000 jobs to reduce costs. Unlike traditional grocery stores that tend to centralize operations, Whole Foods' individual markets for decades have had far greater freedom to choose what they sell.The company is exploring centralized purchasing for  packaged foods and other ""center store"" products, but plans to continue regional buying of produce, seafood and other perishables that are a point of differentiation for the chain, executives said.It is investing in new cash register systems that should keep check-out lines moving faster and track inventory. It also is testing a loyalty program, competitive price-tracking tools and digital promotions. Whole Foods' customer visits were down for the fourth quarter that ended Sept. 27, contributing to a 0.2 percent decline in same-store sales. Analysts polled by Consensus Metrix expected a 0.7 percent rise.This quarter's same-store sales through Nov. 1 were down 2.1 percent.Those sales were up 1.3 percent for the third quarter, 3.6 percent in the second quarter and 4.5 percent in the first quarter of 2015.The retailer's fourth-quarter net income fell by more than half to $56 million, or 16 cents per share.Whole Foods also announced a $1 billion stock buy-back program, dividend increase and capital structure plan.

83,"   By Angela Moon and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Whole Foods Market Inc (WFM.O) shares are expected to swing about 10 percent following its fourth-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, options activity indicates, signaling more volatility for a stock that has lost half its value since the start of the year.Options in the Austin, Texas-based natural and organic goods seller showed Whole Foods shares could make a run toward $34 by week's end and recover some of its recent losses, or dive below $28, toward a four-year low. The stock was trading down 1.4 percent at $30.84 by noon ET on Wednesday.Options activity was largely bearish with near-term put options, which convey the right to sell the shares at a fixed price in the future, trading in heavy volume. Puts betting on the shares dipping below $30.50 by Nov. 20 was among the most- active contracts.Expectations for a large move in the shares are running high. The 30-day at-the-money implied volatility, a gauge of the risk of large moves in the shares, is at 53.1 percent, or higher than 99 percent of readings in the last 52 weeks, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert. Wall Street analysts have largely kept to the sidelines. Some have expressed skepticism about Whole Foods in recent months due to the store's high prices and growing competition from retailers like Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) and Wal-Mart Stories Inc (WMT.N) that are starting to sell organic and natural products.Out of 32 analysts covering Whole Foods, 23 have a hold rating on the shares, according to Thomson Reuters data. Investors have also raised their short bets on the company's shares over the last eight months. The number of shares sold short has jumped to 29 million, up by two-thirds.However, sentiment on social media which tracks a broader audience including average consumers of Whole Foods, indicate otherwise.

84,"   By Angela Moon and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Whole Foods Market Inc (WFM.O) shares are expected to swing about 10 percent following its fourth-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, options activity indicates, signaling more volatility for a stock that has lost half its value since the start of the year.Options in the Austin, Texas-based natural and organic goods seller showed Whole Foods shares could make a run toward $34 by week's end and recover some of its recent losses, or dive below $28, toward a four-year low. The stock was trading down 1.4 percent at $30.84 by noon ET on Wednesday.Options activity was largely bearish with near-term put options, which convey the right to sell the shares at a fixed price in the future, trading in heavy volume. Puts betting on the shares dipping below $30.50 by Nov. 20 was among the most- active contracts.Expectations for a large move in the shares are running high. The 30-day at-the-money implied volatility, a gauge of the risk of large moves in the shares, is at 53.1 percent, or higher than 99 percent of readings in the last 52 weeks, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert. Wall Street analysts have largely kept to the sidelines. Some have expressed skepticism about Whole Foods in recent months due to the store's high prices and growing competition from retailers like Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) and Wal-Mart Stories Inc (WMT.N) that are starting to sell organic and natural products.Out of 32 analysts covering Whole Foods, 23 have a hold rating on the shares, according to Thomson Reuters data. Investors have also raised their short bets on the company's shares over the last eight months. The number of shares sold short has jumped to 29 million, up by two-thirds.However, sentiment on social media which tracks a broader audience including average consumers of Whole Foods, indicate otherwise. The Thomson Reuters social media sentiment analysis index showed a score of 48 for Whole Foods, indicating that overall sentiment is positive, although it has fallen from 90 in early October. The index went slightly below 0, indicating a negative sentiment, just once in the last nine months.

85,"   By Lisa Baertlein  Big changes are coming to Whole Foods Market Inc (WFM.O) as the natural and organic grocery pioneer revamps its pricing and modernizes its business to fend off widespread competition and bolster same-store sales, which unexpectedly fell in the latest quarter.The same-store sales drop hit shares, which fell 6.2 percent to $28.86 in extended trading.In a call after the earnings release, Whole Foods executives laid out plans to shake the chain's high-price ""Whole Paycheck"" reputation without sacrificing its position as a high-quality retailer.""Some would say that increasingly everyone is selling the same food and that price is all that matters,"" co-Chief Executive John Mackey said on a conference call with analysts.""We are going to be competitive on price where we need to be, but, first and foremost, the Whole Foods Market brand stands for the highest quality, selection, and service,"" Mackey said.The Austin, Texas-based chain, whose mainstream competition includes retailers such as Kroger Co (KR.N), Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Trader Joe's, plans to launch a chain of smaller, more value-focused stores next year. Existing efforts to lower prices at Whole Foods have squeezed profits at the chain, which recently cut more than 2,000 jobs to reduce costs.Unlike traditional grocery stores that tend to centralize operations, Whole Foods' individual markets for decades have had far greater freedom to choose what they sell. The company is exploring centralized purchasing for  packaged foods and other ""center store"" products, but plans to continue regional buying of produce, seafood and other perishables that are a point of differentiation for the chain, executives said. It is investing in new cash register systems that should keep check-out lines moving faster and track inventory. It also is testing a loyalty program, competitive price-tracking tools and digital promotions.Whole Foods' customer visits were down for the fourth quarter that ended Sept. 27, contributing to a 0.2 percent decline in same-store sales. Analysts polled by Consensus Metrix expected a 0.7 percent rise.This quarter's same-store sales through Nov. 1 were down 2.1 percent. Those sales were up 1.3 percent for the third quarter, 3.6 percent in the second quarter and 4.5 percent in the first quarter of 2015.The retailer's fourth-quarter net income fell by more than half to $56 million, or 16 cents per share. Whole Foods also announced a $1 billion stock buy-back program, dividend increase and capital structure plan.

86,"   By Robert Iafolla  Dec 28 - Whole Foods Market Inc's policy prohibiting employees from recording in the workplace without prior approval violates federal labor law, the National Labor Relations Board ruled on Thursday. A divided three-member NLRB panel held that Whole Foods' policy was too broad and could be viewed as restricting the right to record concerted activity protected by the National Labor Relations Act, such as recording images of picketing, documenting workplace hazards or capturing evidence for later use in employment-related disputes.

92,"  Upscale grocery chain Whole Foods Market Inc (WFM.O) reported profit and sales above analysts' estimates, as its efforts to shed its high-price ""Whole Paycheck"" image bear fruit.Whole Foods is revamping its pricing and modernizing its business to fend off competition from grocers and retailers such as Kroger Co (KR.N) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N).

96,"   By Lisa Baertlein  Whole Foods Market Inc (WFM.O) on Wednesday reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings as it controlled costs while lowering prices in the face of stiff competition from a bevy of retail rivals.The biggest challenge for the nation's largest natural and organic grocery chain has been to protect profits while it works to shake its ""Whole Paycheck"" reputation for lofty prices and stay a step ahead of Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), Kroger Co (KR.N) and other mainstream grocers that are expanding into the specialty realm Whole Foods pioneered.Shares of Whole Foods rose 2.4 percent to $29.19 in after-hours trading, but remained significantly off their all-time high of just above $63 in October 2013.The company, which recently slashed labor costs by centralizing marketing and some purchasing, later this month will debut the first store in its more affordable chain called 365 by Whole Foods Market. Whole Foods will open its first 365 store in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Silver Lake on May 25.  ""We believe there is customer demand for both (existing and new store) formats,"" said Walter Robb, co-chief executive officer of Whole Foods Market, who added that the company soon will open smaller-format 365 shops in Lake Oswego, Oregon and Bellevue, Washington.""We are excited to learn from these first three stores and evolve from there,"" Robb said. The company is stealing a page from other large grocers by moving to so-called ""everyday low pricing,"" advertising special deals, preparing to roll out a loyalty program and experimenting with digital coupons, mobile payments and delivery.It is also highlighting what makes it different. The company remains a leader in sourcing antibiotic-free meats and local products, and is taking retailing to another level with bars, trendy restaurants and food kiosks in its newer stores. Net income was $142 million, or 44 cents per share, for the second quarter ended April 10, beating analysts' average estimate of 41 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Same-store sales for the quarter slipped 3 percent from a year earlier, more than the 2 percent decline analysts' expected, after lower prices on items like fruits and vegetables did not offset a rise in the number of items sold.Same-store sales have weakened for three straight quarters. They fell 1.8 percent in the first quarter and slipped 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter of the last fiscal year. For the current quarter through May 1, they were down 2.6 percent.

106,"   By Lisa Baertlein  Whole Foods Market Inc (WFM.O) on Wednesday gave a disappointing profit forecast and posted its fourth straight quarter of same-store sales declines as competition, deflation and its own efforts to cut prices hit results.Shares of the company, which is aiming to set itself apart from the competition by becoming America's healthiest grocery store, fell almost 5 percent in after-hours trading.Whole Foods has been trying to shake its ""Whole Paycheck"" reputation of lofty prices and is pouring money into a new value-oriented chain called 365 by Whole Foods Market, which it said had started off well.Still, executives said the nation's largest natural and organic grocery chain is battling ""good enough"" shopping alternatives from Kroger Co (KR.N), Wegmans and H-E-B supermarkets, which have been successfully expanding into the specialty realm it pioneered.Net income for the third quarter fell 22 percent to $120 million, or 37 cents per share, matching the average analyst per-share profit estimate compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue was $3.70 billion for the quarter, short of analysts' estimate of $3.73 billion.  Whole Foods forecast fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of 23 cents to 24 cents per share, below analysts' average profit estimate of 25 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company is reviewing plans for new stores to reflect its ""more conservative"" projections and to adjust for lessons learned from its 365 stores, Co-Chief Executive Walter Robb said on a conference call with analysts. In the first three weeks of the fiscal fourth quarter, through July 24, sales at established Whole Foods stores were down 2.4 percent compared with a year earlier.Declining costs for foods such as produce, beef, almonds and eggs contributed to sales declines, as well as consumers trading down to lower-priced items. But the company said shoppers are buying more products per trip and that some departments, such as produce, are getting more traffic.  Same-store sales were down 2.6 percent for the fiscal third quarter ended July 3. Those sales had dropped 3 percent in the second quarter, 1.8 percent in the first quarter and 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year.The company, which has seen higher than expected healthcare costs erode labor cost savings from centralizing marketing and some purchasing, in May debuted its first 365 store.Analysts worry that competition from other supermarkets as well as from 365 itself will further harm Whole Foods. One analyst recently noted that the Whole Foods near the 365 store in Los Angeles' Silver Lake neighborhood appeared to have lowered prices to be more in line with its newer cousin - fueling worries about cannibalization. Whole Foods opened its second 365 store two weeks ago and plans a third location this year.The retailer is testing an ""imperfect fruit"" program in California as part of a push to reduce food waste by selling wholesome but ""ugly"" produce. It also is testing a rewards program in the Dallas/Forth Worth market with the goal of launching it nationally next year.Joe Agnese, analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence in a client note cut his rating on Whole Foods' stock to ""strong sell"" from ""sell,"" citing narrowing margins, reduced prices and increased marketing spending.

115,"   By Lisa Baertlein | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Whole Foods Market Inc began testing sales of Purple Carrot's vegan meal kits on Wednesday, joining forces with one of many startups that threaten mainstream grocers by delivering boxed, cook-at-home meals. Venture capital firms have funded a bumper crop of meal kit companies, which are particularly popular with sought-after millennials. They include Purple Carrot, Blue Apron, Plated, HelloFresh and Sun Basket, whose subscription plans include weekly shipments with instructions and pre-measured ingredients to make three meals for two people. Purple Carrot downsized its kits for the test at Whole Foods. Those smaller boxes include fixings for a single meal for two people, cost $19.99 and currently are only sold in the grocer's Dedham, Massachusetts, store.Ahold USA already sells its own meal kits at two of its grocery store chains in Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C. Peapod, Ahold's online grocery delivery service, also offers those meal kits without a subscription. Executives at Kroger Co, the largest U.S. supermarket operator, in June said they were ""very open"" to creating a meal kit service or partnering with an existing operator.     Meal kit delivery startups in the United States have raised more than $650 million in venture capital and are expected to generate roughly $1.5 billion in sales in 2016, according to Packaged Facts, a division of MarketResearch.com.While the flood of venture funding supports rapid growth, it also fuels rampant discounting that makes subscriber retention difficult.  A recent report from Fast Company, citing research from 1010data, found that roughly half of Blue Apron subscribers  remained after the second week and only about 10 percent stayed after six months. The research showed similar results for HelloFresh and Plated. The companies called the data inaccurate  but declined to provide retention information.  Bloomberg in September reported that Blue Apron is preparing an initial public offering.  Don Tilson, 53, said he is among the company's lapsed users.""I thought they were kind of pricey for the amount of food you got,"" said Tilson, who lives in Austin, Texas. Purple Carrot Chief Executive Andy Levitt said his company's churn rate is lower than rivals' but conceded that discounting has ""created a promiscuous user base.""The Whole Foods partnership, he said, ""helps expose a lot of consumers to the way a meal kit works and how easy it is to cook a plant-based meal at home.""

That was less steep than the 2.6 percent drop for the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended Sept. 25, and marked the fifth straight quarter of declines. Austin, Texas-based Whole Foods, which said customers are buying more items per visit, forecast same-store sales that are flat to down 2 percent for fiscal 2017. Executives said that deflation and competition pressured revenues, and that Whole Foods planned to step up its advertising, particularly over Thanksgiving and Christmas. Fourth quarter net income rose 57 percent to $88 million, or 28 cents per share. Analysts had expected a per share profit of 24 cents for the latest quarter.Revenue was up almost 2 percent to $3.5 billion for the quarter, held back in part by deflating prices for staples including meat and eggs.The decision to make Mackey sole CEO on Dec. 31 puts the spotlight on an outspoken executive known for his Libertarian political views and leadership in the U.S. health food movement.  Robb told analysts the more streamlined structure is right for the company at this juncture. He will continue as a director and senior adviser to the company.Shares of Whole Foods were up 3.9 percent to $29.63 in extended trading.
