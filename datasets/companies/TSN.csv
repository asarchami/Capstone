0,"   By P.J. Huffstutter | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Jan 9 Tyson Foods Inc., the nation's second largest pork producer, said Thursday it will require more humane animal treatment farmers that raise its pigs and keep a closer eye on all of its hog suppliers in North America.Tyson said it will be rolling out more third-party inspections this year of sow farms that supply it animals. And after an undercover video last year caught an Oklahoma farm operation abusing some of Tyson's own pigs, the company will require all to install video-monitoring systems by year's end, according to a letter Tyson sent out to farmers on Wednesday.Tyson also said in the letter it will force its contract farmers to stop euthanizing sick or injured piglets by blunt force, such as slamming a piglet's head against the ground in order to kill it.Many of these new hog rules for hog producers, according to the letter sent out this week, are required for only those farmers that raise pigs owned by Tyson: Less than 5 percent of the company's annual hog supply in North America comes from these operations, Mickelson said. The company is also asking these contract farmers to roll out pens for pregnant sows that have improved ""quality and quantity of space,"" according to the letter.The letter did not specify what such enclosures should be, but noted that ""we believe future sow housing should allow sows of all sizes to stand, turn around, lie down and stretch their legs."" The majority of Tyson's hogs are supplied by more than 3,000 independent operators, the company said.Tyson said it is encouraging these independent farmers, who sell their animals to Tyson's slaughter plants, to adopt all these new changes, but only the additional third-party audits will be required of such operators this year. The letter was delivered weeks after Tyson Foods terminated its contract with the Oklahoma-based operation after undercover video footage was released showing farm workers hitting pigs with wooden boards, kicking animals and gouging their eyes.The company's policy changes were not in reaction to any one incident, but part of an ongoing push for ""responsible animal practices"" among all of its suppliers, said company spokesman Gary Mickelson.""We're trying to balance the expectations of consumers with the realities of today's hog farming business,"" Mickelson said.",2014-01-09,TSN,"Thu Jan 9, 2014 | 5:29pm EST",Tyson demands better treatment of hogs by its suppliers,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-tyson-hogs-housing-idUSL2N0KJ26Q20140109?type=companyNews

2,"   By Olivia Oran, Soyoung Kim and Greg Roumeliotis | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Tyson Foods Inc (TSN.N) is exploring a bid for Michael Foods Group Inc, a deal that would combine one of the world's largest chicken processors with a large distributor of egg and dairy products, according to three people familiar with the matter.A potential deal for Michael Foods, which is seen worth between $2 billion and $2.5 billion according to the people, would place Tyson, the nation's largest meat producer, into an adjacent category within poultry and protein.Michael Foods, the egg and dairy products producer owned by Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N) private equity unit, is in the early stages of finding a buyer, and Tyson may ultimately choose not to move forward with an offer, the people cautioned.Michael Foods is working with Goldman Sachs' investment banking unit and Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N) on a potential sale, Reuters reported in December. The sources declined to be named because the matter is private. Tyson Foods and Michael Foods declined to comment. A Goldman Sachs spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Minnetonka, Minnesota-based Michael Foods produces and distributes products including specialty eggs, refrigerated potatoes, cheese and other dairy products. Tyson Foods, which has a market cap of around $12 billion, has traditionally shunned large acquisitions. The last major acquisition it made was its 2001 purchase of IBP Inc for $3.2 billion, which helped transform the company into the world's largest meat producer and processor.A tie-up between Tyson and Michael Foods would bring synergies on the poultry side of the business as both companies raise chickens. Goldman Sachs Capital Partners bought Michael Foods from private equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners LP in 2010 for around $1.7 billion. Thomas H. Lee retained an ownership stake of about 20 percent as part of the transaction.In the nine months ending September 28, Michael Foods posted adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $188 million, up 7.2 percent from the same period last year.For the full 2013 year, the company was on track to report EBITDA of around $250 million. Michael Foods is hoping to fetch roughly 9 or ten times that amount, according to the people familiar with the matter.(Reporting by Olivia Oran, Soyoung Kim and Greg Roumeliotis in New York; Editing by Nick Zieminski)",2014-01-16,TSN,"Thu Jan 16, 2014 | 10:56am EST",Exclusive: Tyson weighs $2 billion-plus deal for Michael Foods - sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-michaelfoods-tyson-idUSBREA0F17220140116?type=companyNews
3,"  By Meredith DavisJan 31 Tyson Foods Inc, the largest U.S. meat processor, said on Friday it expects pork supplies to drop 2 to 4 percent this fiscal year, raising wholesale prices, as a deadly pig virus spreads through the U.S. hog belt.Heavier hogs will offset some of the loss in headcount, Jim Lochner, Tyson's chief operating officer, said during a conference call after the company's quarterly earnings release.Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus (PEDv), a highly contagious and potentially fatal pig virus, has contributed to higher hog prices, which are beginning to eat into pork processors' profits. Average prices for live sows surged 28 percent in the last year, according to USDA figures. ""I do want to emphasize information does come out fairly regularly ... and we're just staying on top of it region to region, producer to producer,"" Lochner said, referring to the spread of the disease.Industry analysts estimate up to 4 million may have died from the virus, but there are no official figures for pig fatalities from the disease.  The U.S. hog herd stood at 65.9 million head as of December 2013, U.S. Department of Agriculture data showed. PEDv was first discovered in April 2013 in the United States, the world's the largest pork exporter, and has spread to 23 states and Canada. Transmitted orally and through pig feces, the disease causes diarrhea, vomiting and severe dehydration in the animals, but does not affect humans.Older pigs have a chance of survival, but the virus kills 80 to 100 percent of piglets that are infected. Tyson also said it was monitoring the number of sows affected by the virus.Based in Springdale, Arkansas, Tyson reported quarterly net income of $254 million, or 72 cents per share, up from $173 million, or 49 cents per share, a year earlier, beating analysts estimates.Shares of Tyson were up nearly 10 percent at $37.89 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.Hillshire Brands Co, the Chicago-based maker of Jimmy Dean sausages and Ball Park hot dogs, said on its earnings call on Thursday that it was watching the spread of the virus and its effect on sow prices.",2014-01-31,TSN,"Fri Jan 31, 2014 | 2:06pm EST",UPDATE 1-Tyson Foods says pig virus to cut pork supply by 2-4 percent,http://www.reuters.com//article/tyson-pork-virus-idUSL2N0L51D220140131?type=companyNews

U.S. meat producers last year struggled as rising feed costs crimped margins and forced them to raise prices.Tyson said that it expects grain supplies to increase this year, reducing its costs.The company reaffirmed its sales forecast of about $36 billion for fiscal 2014 and said it still expects a 1 percent rise in overall domestic production of chicken, beef, pork and turkey in fiscal 2014, which ends in September. Pork sales were up $61 million, or 4.5 percent, to $1.4 billion during the latest quarter.Executives said the Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus (PEDv) will decrease pork production by 2 percent to 4 percent.PEDv is a piglet-killing virus, which causes diarrhea, vomiting and severe dehydration in hogs. It has turned up in 23 of the 50 states since its discovery in the United States last April.The virus, which is already established in Europe and Asia, poses no threat to humans and is not a food safety risk. In Canada, it has been contained in Canada to southern Ontario farms. Disappointing results from China, where Tyson is making significant investments to build poultry operations, accounted for most of the $28 million loss in the company's international business.Smith said concerns about the return of avian flu in China threatens to further hamper demand, which is still weak due to a softening economy, food safety concerns and an outbreak of the disease that scared Chinese buyers away from chicken last year.""Demand hasn't recovered, which has led to a substantial oversupply of chicken,"" Smith said, who said on a call with reporters that demand is down as much as 30 percent in China.Due to that, the company is slowing construction of chicken farms until market conditions improve.Smith said Tyson no longer expects its China operations to break even by the end of fiscal 2014.""I think it will take longer,"" he said.Tyson shares have risen more than 50 percent in the last 52 weeks.(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles, Meredith Davis and PJ Huffstutter in Chicago and Maria Ajit Thomas in Bangalore; Editing by Savio D'Souza and Jonathan Oatis)",2014-01-31,TSN,"Fri Jan 31, 2014 | 12:50pm EST","Tyson results beat estimates on higher chicken, beef sales",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-tyson-results-idUSBREA0U0R520140131?type=companyNews

6,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 31 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has taken the following rating actions  on Tyson Foods, Inc. (Tyson; NYSE: TSN): --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) affirmed at 'BBB'; --Short-term IDR upgraded to â€˜F2â€™ from â€˜F3â€™; --Unsecured bank facility affirmed at 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured notes affirmed at 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook is Positive.  At the fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 28, 2013, Tyson had approximately $1.9  billion of total debt.  Upgrade of Short-term IDR The upgrade of Tysonâ€™s short-term IDR reflects the firmâ€™s long-term IDR rating  of â€˜BBBâ€™ and Fitchâ€™s assessment of Tysonâ€™s liquidity and FCF generation over  time. Tyson has generated an average of $571 million of FCF annually over the  past five years and maintains at least $1.2 billion - $1.5 billion of liquidity,  inclusive of cash and revolver availability. Year-end cash balances have  averaged $983 million since 2009. Additionally, the firmâ€™s cash  coverage-to-short-term debt and debt service metrics consistently meet Fitchâ€™s  requirements for the â€˜F2â€™ rating level. Tyson currently does not have any  commercial paper outstanding. Positive Outlook, Rating Triggers The Positive Rating Outlook reflects Fitchâ€™s view that Tysonâ€™s financial and  business risk has lessened over the past several years, due to significant debt  reduction and structural improvements in operations, and that there is room in  the current ratings. Tyson has paid off over $1.5 billion of debt since the end  of fiscal 2009. The firm also has fewer fixed price customer contracts, is  matching its production with its demand, is more measured in its use of  financial derivatives, and benefits from being diversified across multiple  proteins. Should credit metrics remain near Fitchâ€™s expectations, as discussed  below, the ratings could be upgraded to â€˜BBB+â€™.  Key Rating Drivers Low Leverage, Good Liquidity Tyson is successfully meeting its goal of total debt-to-EBITDA at 1.3 times (x)  or less and liquidity in the $1.2 billion â€“ $1.5 billion range in most years.  For the LTM period ended Dec. 28, 2013, total debt-to-operating EBITDA was  roughly 1.0x and liquidity, inclusive of $825 million of cash and availability  under the firmâ€™s undrawn $1 billion revolving credit facility, totaled $1.8  billion.  For fiscal 2014, Fitch projects that total debt-to-operating EBITDA and  operating EBITDA-to-gross interest expense will approximate 1.0x and 20x,  respectively. Fitch is also forecasting FFO fixed charge coverage of over 5.0x  and that FCF will exceed $600 million. Tysonâ€™s cash flow priorities include  investing in its business, with capital expenditures projected at $700 million  in fiscal 2014, making strategic acquisitions, and returning cash to  shareholders while maintaining low leverage and ample liquidity. Ratings Can Accommodate Moderate-Size Acquisitions Tyson is focused on expanding in value-added prepared foods and in high-growth  international markets. Over the past 12 months, Tyson has funded three small  acquisitions including; Don Julio Foods (Don Julio), Circle Foods, LLC (Circle  Foods), and Boscoâ€™s Pizza Co., with internally generated cash. The purchase  price for Don Julio and Circle Foods totaled approximately $106 million while  the price for Boscoâ€™s Pizza Co. was not disclosed.  Based on the current trajectory of Tysonâ€™s earnings, Fitch believes the company  can absorb an incremental $1 billion - $1.5 billion of debt to finance an  accretive acquisition and still maintain ratings. Fitch views leverage near 2.0x  as acceptable for Tyson at the â€˜BBBâ€™ level. Industry Fundamentals and Recent Earnings Industry margins in beef could continue to be pressured by record low U.S.  cattle supply over the intermediate term while Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea (PED)  disease across farms in the mid-west could challenge pork processing margins in  2014 due to reduced U.S. hog supplies. However, low corn prices should support  profitability for chicken producers, result in increased hog weights, and  incentivize ranchers to start rebuilding cattle herds. Additionally, based on  the USDAâ€™s latest forecasts, protein demand should remain favorable in 2014 with  total red meat and poultry exports projected to increase 1% and overall U.S. per  capita protein consumption projected to remain stable.  Fitch expects fiscal 2014 to mark the fifth consecutive year of strong operating  performance for Tyson. After absorbing about $1.5 billion of incremental feed  costs during fiscal 2011, 2012, and 2013, Tyson projects that its feed costs  will decline by approximately $600 million in fiscal 2014. For fiscal 2014, management also believes operating margins in chicken could be  above its normalized range of 5% - 7% and expects profitability in pork to be  within the 6% - 8% normal range. Tyson has indicated that margins for beef and  prepared foods may be below targets of 2.5% - 4.5% and 4% - 6%, respectively,  due to industry conditions in beef and investments to grow in value-added.  Fitch views Tysonâ€™s normalized segment level margins for chicken, pork, and  prepared foods as reasonable. However, based on historical segment margins for  beef, the firmâ€™s 2.5% - 4.5% range may be too high. Nonetheless, based on each  segmentâ€™s proportional contribution to fiscal 2013 sales, Fitch believes Tysonâ€™s  consolidated profitability can range between 4% - 6% on an operating margin  basis and 5% - 7% on an EBITDA margin basis in most years. During the first fiscal quarter ended Dec. 28, 2013, operating earnings remained  strong, increasing 36% versus prior year to $412 million. Operating margins in  pork, chicken, beef, and prepared foods were 8.5%, 7.5%, 1.6%, and 1.8%,  respectively.  Liquidity, Maturities and Debt Terms  As mentioned previously, Tyson's liquidity totaled approximately $1.8 billion at  Dec. 28, 2013 and consisted of $825 million of cash and an undrawn $1 billion  unsecured revolver. Following the payoff of $458 million of 3.25% convertible  notes that matured on Oct. 15, 2013, significant upcoming maturities are limited  to $638 million of 6.6% senior unsecured notes due April 1, 2016.  Tyson's revolving facility expires Aug. 9, 2017. The facility is guaranteed by  Tyson and its Tyson Fresh Meats (TFM) subsidiary as long as TFM guarantees the  $638 million 2016 and $1 billion 2022 senior unsecured notes. The facility has a  ratings-based collateral trigger or springing lien should Tyson's corporate  credit rating falls below a 'BB+' or equivalent level. Tyson's $120 million 7%  notes due 2018 and $18 million 7% notes 2028 notes do not benefit from a TFM  guarantee. Fitch does not delineate ratings based on these guarantees due to  Tyson's strong credit protection measures and low probability of default.  Financial maintenance covenants in Tyson credit facility include maximum  adjusted debt-to-capitalization ratio of .50 to 1.0 and minimum  EBITDA-to-interest expense of 3.75x. The agreement also has a maximum total debt  covenant of $3.5 billion. Tyson has considerable room under these covenants. At  Dec. 28, 2013, total reported debt was $1.9 billion, and Fitch estimates that  debt-to-capitalization was approximately 24% while EBITDA-to-interest was about  four times required levels.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch views Tysonâ€™s ratings as capped at the â€˜BBB+â€™ rating due to the firmâ€™s low  margins and significant exposure to agricultural supply/demand cycles. Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to an upgrade  to 'BBB+' include:  --Total debt-to-operating EBITDA below 2.0x, with operating performance that is  in line with Fitchâ€™s expectations, at least $1 billion of liquidity, and  continued generation of meaningful annual FCF.  Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a downgrade  include:  --A substantial increase in leverage where total debt-to-operating EBITDA is  sustained above 2.5x due to more aggressive financial strategy associated with  debt-financed acquisitions, share repurchases, and/or a severe downturn in  operating results.

Separately, it expects this year's pork supplies to be down as much as 4 percent, slightly more than previously thought, due to a deadly piglet virus outbreak.Continued weakness in China, where Tyson is making significant investments to build poultry operations, accounted for most of the $30 million loss in the company's international business during its second quarter that ended March 29.""For the first time that I can remember, domestic pork prices (in China) are actually cheaper than imported pork prices would be,"" Tyson Chief Executive Donnie Smith said on a conference call with reporters.Cheap pork, which is a preferred meat in China, is weighing on chicken sales there, said Smith, who added that he believes the worst is over in China. The porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv) reduced hog supplies in Tyson's latest quarter, but that was partially offset by heavier animal weights, Smith told analysts.Tyson expects PEDv to peak in August and to begin to ease in October, Smith said.PEDv was first being identified in the United States a year ago. More than 4,000 outbreaks have been seen in at least 30 U.S. states, four Canadian provinces and several areas of Mexico. The virus causes diarrhea, vomiting and severe dehydration, and is transmitted orally and through pig feces. While older pigs have a chance of survival, the virus kills 80 percent to 100 percent of piglets that contract it.The quarterly results from Tyson landed as U.S. consumers grapple with sky-rocketing prices for beef and pork and are shifting their purchases to lower-priced chicken.Tyson warned that overall domestic protein production for the year ending September would decrease about 1 percent, mostly due to lower hog supplies.In the latest quarter, beef sales volumes slipped 1.8 percent, hurt by reduced export sales. Tyson said it expected to see a reduction of industry-fed cattle supplies for beef of 3 percent to 4 percent in fiscal 2014.Beef prices have been spiking on rising feed costs and the decline of the U.S. domestic cattle herd, now the smallest since 1951. The average price for beef was up 13 percent in Tyson's latest quarter, slightly more than the 12.5 percent increase in pork prices.Pork sales rose about 13 percent to $1.49 billion, helped by higher prices.Increased demand for chicken helped send Tyson's chicken sales up about 4 percent to $2.84 billion in the latest quarter.Net income attributable to Tyson jumped to $213 million, or 60 cents per share, for the second quarter, from $95 million, or 26 cents per share, a year earlier.(Reporting by Devika Krishna Kumar in Bangalore and Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Kirti Pandey, Don Sebastian, W Simon and Marguerita Choy)",2014-05-05,TSN,"Mon May 5, 2014 | 1:44pm EDT","Tyson profit misses, shares fall 9 percent on growth jitters",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-tyson-foods-results-idUSBREA440AX20140505?type=companyNews

25,"  * Tyson comments draw mixed reaction* Weak live cattle futures settlement* CME feeder cattle peak at new highBy Theopolis WatersCHICAGO, May 21 Chicago Mercantile Exchange hog futures closed higher on Wednesday, supported by short-covering and fund buying, traders said.Speculation about tight supplies ahead pegged to the fatal Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus (PEDv) provided further support to futures that ignored Wednesday's drop in market-ready hog and wholesale pork prices.The morning's average hog price in the Iowa/Minnesota market fell $2.01 per cwt from Tuesday to $109.20, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.Separate USDA data showed wholesale pork values slid $1.10 per cwt from Tuesday to $115.61 cents.Futures may be looking beyond current negative market factors and ahead to a tight hog supply situation later, said K&S Financials analyst Jack Salzsieder. On Wednesday, Tyson Foods Inc, told Reuters the company is buying heavier hogs and plans to scale back production this summer as it copes with PEDv-reduced hog supplies.Tyson's remarks had no tangible impact on the market because investors have known for some time that packers are using bigger hogs and cutting kills to offset PEDv, a trader said.Dan Norcini, an independent hog futures trader, said: ""The Tyson thing will be used by bulls to talk up expected hog shortages. They are not paying attention to heavy weight hogs.""Thursday could usher in a volatile session as some investors even up positions before an early start to their Memorial Day holiday. Traders will eye USDA's evening cash hog and wholesale pork data to confirm the morning pullback in prices for both markets.June hogs ended 1.325 cents per lb higher at 119.925, and July up 1.650 cents at 126.825.CASH WOES DROP LIVE CATTLE CME live cattle closed lower in anticipation of steady to weak prices for slaughter-ready or cash cattle this week, traders said. Packers will need fewer animals as they curtail operations to counter tight supplies and will close plants during Monday's holiday.A seasonal surge in supplies could keep a lid on cash returns.Last week, cash cattle in Texas and Kansas, on average, moved at $145 per hundredweight (cwt), and $148 in Nebraska.Improved wholesale beef prices, helped by reduced slaughters and increased retail demand for grilling, minimized futures losses.June closed 0.475 cent per lb lower at 138.275 cents, and August 0.500 cent lower at 139.600.CME feeder cattle hit a new high, supported by firm deep-deferred month live cattle futures.Traders simultaneously sold May futures, which will expire on Thursday, and bought the August contract in a trading strategy known as spreading.May closed up 0.150 cent per lb at 189.200 cents, and August 0.600 cent higher at 196.525 cents.

27,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 29 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of Tyson Foods,  Inc. (Tyson; NYSE: TSN) following the firm's unsolicited offer to acquire The  Hillshire Brands Co. (Hillshire; NYSE: HSH). The Rating Outlook has been revised  to Stable from Positive. Tyson's ratings are as follows: --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'BBB'; --Short-term IDR 'F2'; --Unsecured bank facility 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured notes 'BBB'. At March 29, 2014, Tyson had approximately $1.9 billion of total debt. Key Rating Drivers: Offer to Acquire Hillshire The rating action is driven by Tyson's offer today to acquire Hillshire for $50  per share or $6.8 billion including approximately $700 million of net debt. The  price also includes $163 million to cover the termination fee payable to  Pinnacle Foods, Inc. (Pinnacle) if Tyson's proposal is accepted. The transaction  multiple is approximately 13.4x and represents a 35% premium to Hillshire's  stock price on May 9, 2014, the day prior to its announced agreement to acquire  Pinnacle for $6.6 billion. Fitch will review Tyson's ratings should there be a  material change in the bid, which would prevent the company from reducing debt  levels in a timely manner, as discussed below.  Fitch estimates that Tyson's pro forma total debt-to-operating EBITDA, assuming  100% debt-financing, would be in the low 3.0x range but views Tyson's  willingness to issue equity in order to maintain investment grade favorably. For  the LTM period ended March 29, 2014, Tyson's total debt-to-operating EBITDA was  0.9x and Hillshire's was 1.7x.  Total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR  (defined as total debt plus 8x gross rent-to-operating EBITDA plus gross rent)  was 1.5x for the period. Pro forma free cash flow (FCF) was $800 million.  The ratings affirmation and Stable Outlook reflect the current offer and Fitch's  expectation that leverage can decline to the low-to-mid-2.0x range within 12- 18  months of transaction closing. Tyson's currently low leverage and significant  cash flow generation from a combined Tyson/Hillshire entity should allow for  rapid deleveraging.  Fitch views the potential acquisition of Hillshire as being in line with Tyson's  strategy of expanding in prepared foods and value-added products, further  diversifying the company away from lower-margin commodity meats. Moreover,  substantial supply chain and production-related synergies are anticipated given  Tyson's No. 2 position in U.S. pork production and the combined entities  infrastructure in prepared foods. For the LTM period, Tyson's operating EBITDA  margin, as calculated by Fitch, was 6.2% while Hillshire's was 13.8%. The  proposed transaction should be immediately accretive to Tyson's margins. Liquidity, Maturities and Debt Terms  At March 29, 2014, Tyson's had approximately $1.4 billion of liquidity  consisting of $438 million of cash and availability under an undrawn $1 billion  unsecured revolver.  Significant upcoming maturities are limited to $638 million  of 6.6% senior unsecured notes due April 1, 2016. All of Hillshire's unsecured  notes, except the 6.125% notes due 2033, include a Change of Control Triggering  Event provision. Fitch does not believe Tyson would be required to redeem  Hillshire's outstanding bonds if its bid is successful, given that the bond  provisions require a downgrade to non-investment grade by all three agencies. Tyson's revolving facility expires Aug. 9, 2017. The facility is guaranteed by  Tyson and its Tyson Fresh Meats (TFM) subsidiary as long as TFM guarantees the  $638 million 2016 and $1 billion 2022 senior unsecured notes. The facility has a  ratings-based collateral trigger or springing lien should Tyson's corporate  credit rating falls below a 'BB+' or equivalent level. Tyson's $120 million 7%  notes due 2018 and $18 million 7% notes 2028 notes do not benefit from a TFM  guarantee. Fitch does not delineate ratings based on these guarantees due to  Tyson's strong credit protection measures and low probability of default.  Financial maintenance covenants in Tyson's credit facility include maximum  adjusted debt-to-capitalization ratio of .50 to 1.0 and minimum  EBITDA-to-interest expense of 3.75x. The agreement also has a maximum total debt  covenant of $3.5 billion. Fitch anticipates that Tyson's credit facility would  have to be amended to allow for the acquisition of Hillshire. However, Tyson  currently has considerable room under these covenants. At March 29, 2014, total  reported debt was $1.9 billion, and Fitch estimates that debt-to-capitalization  was approximately 25% while adjusted EBITDA-to-interest was about 4x required  levels. RATING SENSITIVITIES  Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a downgrade  to 'BBB-' include:  --A substantial increase in leverage where total debt-to-operating EBITDA is  sustained above 2.5x due to a more aggressive financial strategy associated with  debt-financed acquisitions, share repurchases, and/or a severe downturn in  operating results.  Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to an upgrade  to 'BBB+' include:  --An upgrade is not anticipated in the near term given Tyson's demonstrated  willingness to engage in large-size acquisitions; --Total debt-to-operating EBITDA sustained below 2.0x, with operating  performance that is in line with Fitch's expectations, at least $1 billion of  liquidity, and continued generation of FCF that averages more than $500 million  annually.

Data from the Commerce Department showed that gross domestic product contracted for the first time in three years in the first quarter, although signs indicated it has rebounded.

Both all-cash bids include the assumption of Hillshire's debt. Tyson put the total value of its bid at $6.8 billion, based on 125 million outstanding Hillshire shares and debt of roughly $500 million.  About two weeks ago, Hillshire said it planned to buy Pinnacle Foods Inc (PF.N), known for its Birds Eye frozen vegetables, in a deal it valued at $4.3 billion excluding debt. That pact, considered less appealing by some investors and analysts, could be in peril as the Tyson and Pilgrim's bids require Hillshire to terminate the Pinnacle deal.Hillshire said in a statement that it would thoroughly review Tyson's proposal.

As U.S. consumers add more protein and fresh food to their diets, food sellers seek to turn the trend into profit.

Tyson's prepared foods business focuses on foodservice clients and private label. The acquisition would raise its profile in the grocery aisle, where Hillshire also sells Aidells artisan sausages, Ball Park hot dogs and Jimmy Dean bacon. The company said the merger would provide it with ""stable and consistent demand for protein products"".Tyson said it secured financing from Morgan Stanley Senior Funding Inc for the deal, which is expected to add to its earnings in the first year after completion.

37,"  (This story originally appeared on IFRe.com, a Thomson Reuters publication)By Michelle Sierra, Joan Magee and Davide ScigliuzzoNEW YORK, May 30 (TRLPC/IFR) - Wall Street firms are joining the sizzling four-party food fight involving Hillshire Brands, Pilgrim's Pride, Pinnacle Foods and Tyson Foods. Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs are separately ready to serve the necessary financing to the winner.Morgan Stanley is providing the committed financing backing meat processor Tyson Foods' unsolicited bid of US$6.8bn for food producer Hillshire Brands. Tyson also said it expected JP Morgan to join the facility in the ""near future"".Meanwhile, Pilgrim's Pride, controlled by Brazilian meatpacker JBS, is lining up roughly US$6bn in debt to finance a hostile all-cash bid, valued at US$6.4bn, for Hillshire, and JBS's relationship banks are pitching financing options to the firm.Separately, Goldman Sachs is providing US$5.3bn in loans to back the US$6.6bn combination of Hillshire and branded food producer Pinnacle Foods that was announced two weeks ago. The facility consists of a US$500m revolving credit facility and a US$4.8bn senior secured Term Loan B, according to a regulatory filing. HUNGRY, HUNGRY BANKERS The four-way tug-of-war may stem from the lack of good quality assets still available in the food and beverage market, bankers said. The accessibility to cheap financing is further enhancing M&A activity in the sector.Based on completed deals, the M&A volume figure for the beverage, food and tobacco processing industry is US$4.62bn, according to Thomson Reuters data. Whichever bid ultimately prevails, banks are expecting chunky financing fees and plenty of ancillary business.""It should be good for banks if Hillshire goes to an investment grade strategic bidder,"" a senior banker said.The tussle is already affecting existing lending relationships. JBS said on Thursday it had postponed a US$750m high-yield bond deal, due to be led by bookrunners Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo. Although the bond was slated to refinance some 2016 bond maturities and other shorter-term debt, a person with knowledge of the situation suggested there was a conflict of interest as Morgan Stanley was providing financing for the Tyson bid for Hillshire.Bankers said the announcement of the committed financing from Tyson adds a level of certainty that may make the Tyson bid stronger. However, it is yet to be seen who will prevail.""It depends,"" another banker said. ""It will ultimately be up to the company.""Earlier this month, the food and beverage industry welcomed Hillshire's offer to buy Pinnacle for US$4.3bn. The cash-and-stock deal would establish Hillshire as the owner of 10 packaged food brands that are either market leaders or second in their categories, the companies said.The two new bidders, however, turned up this week at the buyers' table, derailing Hillshire's plans. On Thursday, Tyson raised the stakes by bidding about US$6.8bn for Hillshire. Two days earlier, Pilgrim's Pride also made an unsolicited bid for Hillshire of nearly US$5.7bn plus debt, totalling about US$6.4bn.

The company, the world's second largest meat processor after Brazil's JBS SA, had offered $50 per share.JBS owns about 75 percent of Pilgrim's Pride.

49,"   By Lisa Baertlein  Tyson Foods Inc (TSN.N) won the bidding war for Hillshire Brands Co HSH.N with an all-cash offer that values the maker of Jimmy Dean sausages at $8.55 billion and would be the biggest deal yet for the global meat business.Tyson, the largest U.S. meat processor, on Monday announced an agreement to buy Hillshire for $63 per share. That topped last week's $55 bid from Pilgrim's Pride Corp (PPC.O), which is majority owned by Brazilian meatpacking giant JBS SA (JBSS3.SA).The high-stakes battle for Hillshire, which also sells Ball Park hot dogs, Jimmy Dean frozen breakfast sandwiches and Aidells artisan sausages, underscores how urgently large commodity meat companies want to gobble up popular, and more profitable, brands. ""We want to buy this business for what it can become, not just for what it is now. Great brands like Hillshire, Jimmy Dean and Ball Park just don't come available very often,"" Tyson Chief Executive Donnie Smith said on a conference call with reporters. ""We determined that it was in the best interests of our shareholders not to increase our proposed price,"" Pilgrim's said in a statement on Monday. Pilgrim's $45 per share offer on May 27 sparked the bidding war.Investors cheered the final deal, sending shares in Hillshire up 5.1 percent to $61.92 in afternoon trading.Analysts had warned that a bidding war could result in the winner overpaying for Hillshire. They also said such a merger could give the winner a competitive advantage that would be hard for the loser to match.  To that end, shares in Tyson and Pilgrim's were down 4.9 percent and 6.1 percent, respectively.Athlos Research principal Jonathan Feeney said Tyson overpaid ""in a conventional sense."" But, he said, Tyson can afford it because of what Hillshire brings to the table with its popular grocery brands.With the Hillshire deal coming to a close, Feeney and others say Kraft Foods Group Inc's KRFT.O Oscar Mayer lunch meat and hot dog brand could be the next target.  Tyson's offer for Hillshire expires Dec. 12. It is contingent on Hillshire dropping plans to buy Birds Eye frozen vegetable seller Pinnacle Foods Inc (PF.N) for $6.6 billion deal, including debt.Hillshire on Monday said it had not approved the Tyson offer and had not changed its recommendation that shareholders vote for the Pinnacle deal. Some analysts say China's Shuanghui International Holdings Ltd set the current food fight in motion last May when the company, now called WH Group Ltd, bought Smithfield Foods Inc for $4.7 billion, excluding debt.Tyson's Hillshire offer, excluding debt, comes to $7.7 billion.

50,"  (Adds comment on price of deal, antitrust, byline)By Lisa BaertleinJune 9 Tyson Foods Inc won the bidding war for Hillshire Brands Co with an all-cash offer that values the maker of Jimmy Dean sausages at $8.55 billion and would be the biggest deal yet for the global meat business.Tyson, the largest U.S. meat processor, on Monday announced an agreement to buy Hillshire for $63 per share. That topped last week's $55 bid from Pilgrim's Pride Corp, which is majority owned by Brazilian meatpacking giant JBS SA.The high-stakes battle for Hillshire, which also sells Ball Park hot dogs, Jimmy Dean frozen breakfast sandwiches and Aidells artisan sausages, underscores how urgently large commodity meat companies want to gobble up popular, and more profitable, brands.""We want to buy this business for what it can become, not just for what it is now. Great brands like Hillshire, Jimmy Dean and Ball Park just don't come available very often,"" Tyson Chief Executive Donnie Smith said on a conference call with reporters.""We determined that it was in the best interests of our shareholders not to increase our proposed price,"" Pilgrim's said in a statement on Monday. Pilgrim's $45 per share offer on May 27 sparked the bidding war. Investors cheered the final deal, sending shares in Hillshire up 5.1 percent to $61.92 in afternoon trading.Analysts had warned that a bidding war could result in the winner overpaying for Hillshire. They also said such a merger could give the winner a competitive advantage that would be hard for the loser to match.To that end, shares in Tyson and Pilgrim's were down 4.9 percent and 6.1 percent, respectively.Athlos Research principal Jonathan Feeney said Tyson overpaid ""in a conventional sense."" But, he said, Tyson can afford it because of what Hillshire brings to the table with its popular grocery brands. With the Hillshire deal coming to a close, Feeney and others say Kraft Foods Group Inc's Oscar Mayer lunch meat and hot dog brand could be the next target.Tyson's offer for Hillshire expires Dec. 12. It is contingent on Hillshire dropping plans to buy Birds Eye frozen vegetable seller Pinnacle Foods Inc for $6.6 billion deal, including debt.Hillshire on Monday said it had not approved the Tyson offer and had not changed its recommendation that shareholders vote for the Pinnacle deal. Some analysts say China's Shuanghui International Holdings Ltd set the current food fight in motion last May when the company, now called WH Group Ltd, bought Smithfield Foods Inc for $4.7 billion, excluding debt.Tyson's Hillshire offer, excluding debt, comes to $7.7 billion.Tyson plans to fund the deal with existing cash and a fully committed bridge facility from Morgan Stanley Senior Funding Inc and JP Morgan Securities LLC.Four antitrust experts told Reuters the deal likely would win approval from regulators since the companies tend to sell different products.""If there is a category on the branded side that raises an (antitrust) issue, there's always an opportunity to sell off the brand,"" said Jonathan Lewis, an antitrust expert with the law firm Baker Hostetler.(Reporting by Devika Krishna Kumar, Olivia Oran, Diane Bartz and Supriya Kurane; Editing by Kirti Pandey, Ted Kerr and Andrew Hay)",2014-06-09,TSN,"Mon Jun 9, 2014 | 2:07pm EDT",UPDATE 4-Tyson wins bid for Hillshire in battle of meat titans,http://www.reuters.com//article/tyson-hillshire-brands-idUSL2N0OQ00J20140609?type=companyNews

58,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 17 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB' rating to the  following senior unsecured debt issues of Tyson Foods, Inc. (Tyson; NYSE: TSN): --$1,306 million term loan A due 2017; --$594 million term loan A due 2019; --$600 million term loan B due 2019. See the full list of Tyson's ratings at the end of this press release.  At March  29, 2014, Tyson had approximately $1.9 billion of total debt, consisting mainly  of senior unsecured notes maturing 2016 through 2028. The Rating Outlook is Stable.  Proceeds from the term loans form part of the financing for Tyson's $8.6 billion  acquisition of The Hillshire Brands Co. (Hillshire; NYSE: HSH).  The 'BBB'  rating reflects Fitch's expectation that Tyson will issue sufficient equity to  partially fund the transaction and that total debt-to-EBITDA will decline to  between 2.0x and 2.5x within two years of transaction closing which is  anticipated to occur by Sept. 27, 2014.   The new senior unsecured term loans rank pari passu with Tyson's existing debt,  most of which includes a guarantee from Tyson Fresh Meats, Inc. Pricing is  ratings-based with an applicable margin ranging from 112.5 basis points (bps) to  250 bps over LIBOR depending on the tranche.  The three-year and five-year term loan A tranches amortize quarterly at a rate  of 2.5% while the five-year term loan B tranche is a bullet maturity. The loans  are subject to financial maintenance covenants that replicate those in Tyson's  recently amended revolving credit facility discussed in the Liquidity,  Maturities, and Covenants section below.   KEY RATING DRIVERS Equity Financing for Hillshire Acquisition and Post Closing Deleveraging:  On July 1, 2014, Tyson entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Hillshire  for $63 per share, or $8.6 billion including Hillshire's net debt and a $163  million termination fee associated with Hillshire's previously proposed  acquisition of Pinnacle Foods, Inc.  Pro forma leverage, assuming 100% debt  financing, is approximately 4.0x based on March 2014 LTM data.  However, Tyson  plans to fund a portion of the purchase with equity and is committed to  deleveraging in order to maintain its investment grade rating. Ratings reflect  Fitch's expectation that the combined entity will generate an average of roughly  $700 million of annualized free cash flow (FCF). Complementary, Margin-Accretive Nature of Transaction; Realization of Meaningful  Synergies:  Fitch views the pending acquisition of Hillshire as in line with Tyson's  strategy of expanding in prepared foods and value-added products. Pro forma for  the acquisition, prepared foods will increase to 18% and 20% of Tyson's revenue  and operating income, respectively, from 9% and 5% during the LTM ended March  29, 2014. Tyson expects the addition of the Hillshire assets to provide a  significant 300 bp lift to prepared foods segment margins. Tyson's prepared  foods segment's operating margin, at 2.2% for the recent LTM, was below  normalized expectations of 4% to 6% due to higher raw material costs and  spending related to the launch of its Day Starts line of breakfast products. The mid-16x multiple Tyson expects to pay for Hillshire, however, is rich and  ranks historically as one of the highest among U.S. food company transactions.   Tyson estimates that the purchase multiple is approximately 10.5x including its  projected $300 million or more of annualized synergies to be realized within  three years. Synergies will come from supply chain efficiencies, the alignment  of shared services, and leveraging sales and marketing infrastructure. Fitch  views the realization of synergies and anticipated margin expansion as key  rating factors for Tyson. Earnings Remain Strong:  Fitch expects fiscal 2014 to mark the fifth consecutive year of strong operating  performance for Tyson. After absorbing about $1.5 billion of incremental feed  costs during fiscal 2011, 2012, and 2013, Tyson projects that its feed costs  will decline by approximately $500 million in fiscal 2014.  For fiscal 2014,  management also believes operating margins in chicken could be above its  normalized range of 5%-7% and expects profitability in pork to be within the  6%-8% normal range. Tyson has indicated that margins for beef and prepared foods  may be below targets of 2.5%-4.5% and 4%-6%, respectively, due to industry  conditions in beef and investments to grow in value-added.  During the first half of fiscal 2014, ended March 29, 2014, operating earnings  were very strong, increasing 43% versus prior year to $773 million. Operating  income was impacted positively by a 2.6% rise in consolidated sales volumes, an  average price increase of 3.8%, and lower feed costs. Operating margins in  chicken, pork, beef, and prepared foods were 8.9%, 7.8%, 1.2%, and 2.1%,  respectively. Fitch believes the previously mentioned normalized margins for  prepared foods and pork could increase as a result of synergies from the  Hillshire acquisition. Industry Fundamentals Are Mixed; Diversification Is A Plus:   Fitch expects industry margins in beef to continue to be pressured by record low  U.S. cattle supply over the near term, while Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea (PED)  disease across farms in the mid-west has reduced U.S. hog supplies. However, low  corn and feed cost should continue to support profitability for chicken  producers, result in increased hog weights, and incentivize ranchers to start  rebuilding cattle herds. Protein demand should remain relatively intact over the  near term.   Liquidity, Maturities and Debt Terms: At March 29, 2014, Tyson's had approximately $1.4 billion of liquidity  consisting of $438 million of cash and availability under an undrawn $1 billion  unsecured revolver. Significant upcoming maturities are limited to $638 million  of 6.6% senior unsecured notes due April 1, 2016. All of Hillshire's unsecured  notes, except the 6.125% notes due 2033, include a Change of Control Triggering  Event provision. Tyson should not have to redeem Hillshire's outstanding bonds,  given that the bond provisions require a downgrade to non-investment grade by  all three agencies. Tyson's revolving facility expires Aug. 9, 2017. The facility is guaranteed by  Tyson and its Tyson Fresh Meats (TFM) subsidiary as long as TFM guarantees the  $638 million 2016 and $1 billion 2022 senior unsecured notes. Tyson's $120  million 7% notes due 2018 and $18 million 7% notes due 2028 do not benefit from  a TFM guarantee. Fitch does not delineate ratings based on these guarantees due  to Tyson's strong credit protection measures and low probability of default.   On June 27, 2014, Tyson amended its credit agreement to allow for the  acquisition of Hillshire. Changes included, among other things, the elimination  of certain limitations related to the incurrence of debt and increasing the  maximum debt-to-capitalization from 50% to 65% through the first full quarter  following the closing of the Hillshire transaction and 60% thereafter. The  previous ratings-based collateral trigger was eliminated and a priority debt  basket of 15% of consolidated net tangible assets was added.  Fitch estimates  that debt-to-capitalization was approximately 24% while adjusted EBITDA-to-interest was about 4x required levels at March 29, 2014. RATING SENSITIVITIES  Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to an  upgrade include: --An upgrade is not likely in the next 12-18 months due to the meaningful  increased leverage following the acquisition of Hillshire and potential  integration risk.  However, what could lead to a rating upgrade would be: --Realization of $300 million of expected synergies,  --100 bps or more of EBITDA margin expansion,  --Annualized FCF increase averaging around $800 million over time, --Greater than expected debt reduction such that total debt-to-operating EBITDA  is sustainable at the low-end of 2x-2.5x range due a combination of operating  income growth and debt reduction, and the maintenance of $1 billion or more of  liquidity. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  negative rating action include: --Weak top-line growth or significant margin contraction due to prolonged supply  or demand imbalances resulting from animal diseases or higher feed cost and  substantially lower than expected FCF such that total debt-to-operating EBITDA  is sustained above approximately 2.5x. --Additional material size acquisitions over the near-term or aggressive  financial policies relating to dividends and share repurchases would be viewed  negatively. Tyson's current ratings are as follows: --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'BBB'; --Short-term IDR 'F2'; --Unsecured bank facility 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured notes 'BBB'.

59,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 18 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has removed The Hillshire Brands Co.'s  (Hillshire; NYSE: HSH) ratings from Rating Watch Evolving and upgraded the  ratings following Hillshire's July 2, 2014 definitive agreement to be acquired  by Tyson Foods, Inc. (Tyson; NYSE: TSN) for $63 per share in cash or $8.6  billion, including net debt and preliminary financing details.

The Ratings Outlook is Stable. At March 29, 2014, Hillshire had $942 million of  total debt. KEY RATING DRIVERS: Upgraded Due to Pending Buyout by Tyson  The upgrade reflects Fitch's view that there is a high probability that Tyson's  acquisition of Hillshire will be completed, Tyson's solid credit profile, the  expectation of strong operational and strategic ties between the two entities,  and Fitch's Parent and Subsidiary Rating Linkage criteria. Fitch currently rates  Tyson 'BBB/F2' with a Stable Outlook.

The buyout represents a 69% premium over Hillshire's stock price on May 9, the  day prior to Hillshire's agreement to acquire Pinnacle Foods Inc. (Pinnacle;  NYSE: PF), which was later terminated. The transaction value includes a $163  million payment Tyson will pay Pinnacle for the termination of Pinnacle's merger  agreement with Hillshire.  Pursuant to the definitive agreement, HMB Holdings,  Inc., a subsidiary of Tyson, commenced a tender offer for 100% of the  outstanding shares of Hillshire's common stock on July 16 with closing of the  tender offer subject to standard regulatory conditions being met.  Credit Measures: Hillshire's total debt-to-EBITDA was 1.7x, EBITDA-to-interest expense was 10.9x,  funds from operations (FFO) interest coverage was 7.1x and free cash flow (FCF)  was $96 million for the latest 12 month (LTM) period ended March 29, 2014.  Tyson's total debt-to-EBITDA was 0.9x, EBITDA-to-interest expense was 16.3x, FFO  interest coverage was 12.2x and FCF was $704 million for the LTM period ended  March 29,2014. Tyson's pro forma leverage will be approximately 3.1x and Fitch  estimates that FCF could average $800 million annually for the combined entity.  Debt Structure: Hillshire is expected to become a wholly owned subsidiary of Tyson. Hillshire's  debt, consisting mainly of $400 million 2.75% 2015 notes, $278 million 4.1% 2020  notes and $152 million 6.125% 2032 notes, is likely to remain at the Hillshire  corporate level. The company also has $102 million of current maturities which  primarily consist of zero coupon notes due in 2014. Terms for all bonds, except  those due in 2032, include a provision for both a change of control and  downgrades to non-investment grade by three rating agencies, which is not  anticipated.   Hillshire is likely to become a material subsidiary of Tyson, as defined by  Tyson's debt agreements, and terms of Tyson's debt include cross-default  language to material subsidiaries. An event of default would occur for Tyson's  term loans, which would become due immediately, if Hillshire fails to perform on  its obligations.  Liquidity:  At March 29, 2014, Hillshire had $219 million of cash, $170 million of  short-term investments, and $747 million of availability, excluding $3 million  of letters of credit, under its $750 million revolving credit facility expiring  June 2017. Hillshire's quarter-end liquidity does not reflect $165 million of  cash to finance its recent acquisition of Van's Natural Foods which closed in  May 2014.  RATING SENSITIVITIES: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include: --Any upgrade will be predicated on Tyson's ratings, given Fitch's Parent and  Subsidiary Rating Linkage criteria. --Due to Tyson's increase in leverage to finance the acquisition a positive  rating action is not likely to occur during the next 18 months. It is Fitch's  expectation that Tyson's leverage will decline to the 2.0x-2.5x range within  18-24 months of the transaction close. Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include: --Hillshire's ratings are not likely to be downgraded in the  near-to-intermediate term, given Fitch's 'BBB/F2' rating on Tyson.   --Although not currently anticipated, ratings could be negatively affected by a  downgrade in Tyson's ratings.

66,"   By Danielle Robinson  NEW YORK, Aug 1 (IFR) - Determined not to squander the years it spent clawing its way out of the junk bond market, Tyson Foods has pandered to bond investors by issuing more equity than first expected to pay for its US$8.2bn acquisition of Hillshire Brands.On Monday, it placed US$950m of stock and US$1.5bn of mandatory tangible equity units, the latter getting 85% equity treatment from the ratings agencies.That was more than the US$1bn-$1.5bn of equity some analysts had expected and significantly bolsters Tyson's pitch to investors within the next two weeks, when it could bring a US$3.25bn bond issue to market.""I'm going to look at this credit now,"" said Rajeev Sharma, investment-grade corporate bond portfolio manager at First Investors Management Co. ""I was anticipating this name to be high yield.""Tyson's ability to avoid the cusp of investment-grade and high yield with a split rating was thrown into question in June, when it began its food fight with Pilgrim's Pride for Hillshire, the king of sport game fast food, with brands such as Ball Park hot dogs and State Fair corn dogs.Tyson originally bid US$6.8bn to beat Pilgrim's Pride for Hillshire, but was eventually forced to pay US$8.55bn including assumed debt, as well as a US$160m break-up fee that Hillshire incurred for ending a planned merger with Pinnacle Foods.As smart as the acquisition was from a strategic perspective, it was alarming to see a company that had worked tirelessly to go from Double B in 2008 to Triple B in 2012 by all agencies to suddenly catapult its leverage from around 1x into the low 3s.Both S&P and Moody's put their BBB and Baa3 ratings on credit watch for downgrade. And Tyson, having suffered from the vagaries of an inherently unpredictable industry, has had to do more than keep one notch above junk. ""They could have raised less equity and stayed investment-grade, but the company prefers a Triple B flat rating,"" said Taylor. ""They don't want to ride the cusp between investment-grade and non-investment-grade, which is what a Triple B minus rating is.""    PRIORITIZING DEBTTyson has vowed to favour debt repayments over share buybacks and is kickstarting its deleveraging plans by earmarking US$575m of proceeds from Monday's sale of JBS in Latin America to pay down debt.""We expect total debt to Ebitda to decline to between 2.0x and 2.5x within two years of the transaction closing,"" said Taylor, from pro forma leverage of about 3.2x.The US$8.2bn of committed financing from Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan will be paid for with US$314m of cash, US$950m of common stock, US$1.5bn of TEUs, US$2.2bn of term loans, and US$3.25bn of bonds. The US$2.2bn term loan is split between a US$1.1bn three-year facility, a US$500m five-year tranche A, and a US$600m five-year tranche B, and the US$3.25bn bonds are expected to be issued in five-, 10- and 30-year maturities, with a weighted average interest rate of around 3.9%.The equity issue prompted S&P to remove Tyson's ratings from negative CreditWatch on Thursday and join Fitch in affirming the credit's BBB ratings.Moody's, now the outlier with a negative watch on Tyson's Baa3 rating, is expected to issue an announcement before the bond deal comes to market.Being on the edge of junk is especially problematic for a large acquisition financing that companies need to spread across the curve to avoid a bunching of redemption towers. ""You especially have to believe things will go well, because if they do drop back into high-yield, there will be no bid for 30-year bonds in the high-yield market,"" said a senior syndicate manager away from the bond issue.Staying away from the risk of tipping into the Double B category can save a company 100bp or more in cost.Tyson is aiming for a 3.91% average weighted interest rate on its bonds, according to Fitch. Its most recent issue was a 10-year in 2012, which was quoted in the past week at a dollar price of 106.25, 116bp over Treasuries and a G-spread of 140bp.Assuming a credit curve of about 25bp to go from 2022 to a 2024 maturity and then deducting around 5bp for the high dollar price, fair value for a new 10-year note would be around 160bp, according to one investor.""That sounds about right for fair value, but I could see it going a bit better than that,"" said a head of bond syndicate in New York. ""There are not many Triple Bs trading north of the 150bp level. We had [BBB- rated gas company] EQM come to market this week in 10-years at Treasuries plus 160bp and split-rated Martin Marietta Materials' June issue of a 10-year at 170bp that is at 165bp. So even with a bias on protein, Treasuries plus 160bp seems very cheap.""The fives/10s credit curve is thought to be around 35bp-40bp for the consumer cyclical sector and some bankers think Tyson would need to pay about 25bp-37.5bp more than its 10-year for a 30-year tranche, depending on its size.With all its filings in place, Tyson can sit and wait for the right market environment to issue. Expectations are that the acquisition will close in late September this year.",2014-08-01,TSN,"Fri Aug 1, 2014 | 3:33pm EDT",Tyson paves way for US$3.25bn bond,http://www.reuters.com//article/markets-credit-idUSL2N0Q72FJ20140801?type=companyNews
67,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, August 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB' rating to Tyson  Foods, Inc.'s (Tyson; NYSE: TSN) $3.25 billion senior unsecured notes offering.  Proceeds from the offering will be used to partially finance the company's  previously announced $8.6 billion acquisition of The Hillshire Brands Company  (Hillshire, 'BBB/F2'/Stable Outlook), discussed below. Tyson is expected to  issue the notes in multiple tranches.  The new senior unsecured notes will be issued under the firm's indenture dated  June 1, 1995 and will rank pari passu with Tyson's existing unsecured debt. The  notes will also be guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Tyson Fresh Meats  Inc. and contain a change of control provision.  This provision conveys to the  holder the right to require Tyson to repurchase the notes at a price equal to  101% of the aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the  date of repurchase upon a change of control and ratings downgrades below  investment grade by two of three rating agencies.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Transaction Financing, Divestiture Proceeds, Deleveraging Plans Tyson's ratings reflect the company's deleveraging plans and the estimated $2.4  billion of equity issued to partially finance the Hillshire acquisition. Fitch  expects total debt-to-EBITDA to decline to between 2.0x and 2.5x within two  years of the transaction closing, which is expected to occur by Sept. 27, 2014,  due to debt reduction and EBITDA growth. Tyson plans to use net proceeds from  the recently announced sale of its poultry businesses in Mexico and Brazil for  $575 million to pay down debt. Moreover, Fitch's baseline projection is that  Tyson will generate at least $600 million of annualized free cash flow (FCF)  following its acquisition of Hillshire. Pro Forma Capital Structure, Equity Offerings Financing for Hillshire consists of approximately $6 billion of debt and $2.4  billion of equity. The debt portion of the financing includes $2.5 billion of  unsecured term loans, $3.25 billion of senior notes, and about $205 million of  senior amortizing notes associated with tangible equity units (TEUs). Pro forma  leverage, based on March 2014 data and roughly $8.9 billion of total debt, is  3.2x. On July 30, 2014, Tyson announced that it priced public offerings for 24 million  shares of its class A common stock and 30 million TEUs. Net proceeds from the  common stock issuance, assuming no over-allotment, totaled $873 million (or $1  billion with the full 3.6 million over-allotment option). The TEUs, which are  composed of a prepaid stock purchase contract and a senior amortizing note, were  sold at $50 per unit for net proceeds of $1.5 billion. The TEUs would get  substantial equity treatment. Hillshire Acquisition Complementary, Provides Significant Synergies Fitch views the pending acquisition of Hillshire as in line with Tyson's  strategy of expanding in prepared foods and value-added products and expects the  purchase to be accretive to margins. Tyson's prepared foods operating margin was  1.3% for the nine months ended June 28, 2014, excluding a $49 million impairment  charge related to the closure of three plants. Results were well below current  normalized expectations of 4%-6% as performance has been impacted negatively by  higher raw materials and investments in growth platforms. Hillshire's operating  margin for the LTM period ended March 29, 2014 was roughly 10%. Tyson expects more than $225 million of operational, purchasing, and  distribution synergies from combining its prepared foods business with Hillshire  in fiscal 2015. The firm increased total projected synergies to at least $500  million within three years, up from its original estimate of $300 million. Fitch  views the realization of synergies and anticipated margin expansion combined  with debt reduction as key rating factors for Tyson. The company plans to  provide a new normalized range for prepared foods after the Hillshire  transaction closes. Earnings Remain Strong Fiscal 2014 will mark the fifth consecutive year of strong operating performance  for Tyson. For the nine-months ended June 28, 2014, operating earnings increased  17% versus prior year to $1.1 billion inclusive of $49 million of impairment.  Operating income saw a 2.5% rise in consolidated sales volumes, an average price  increase of 5.4%, and a $460 million decline in feed costs. Operating margins in  chicken, pork, and beef were 8.2%, 7.6%, and 1.7%, respectively. Tyson expects fiscal 2015 to be another strong year. Feed costs are projected to  decline $400 million in 2015, after declining $500 million in fiscal 2014, and  overall protein demand is projected to remain robust. Tyson's guidance includes  operating margins at or above 10% for chicken and within the 6%-8% normalized  range for pork. Profitability for beef is expected to be similar to levels in  2014 and to improve by $50 million in the international segment due to better  pricing. Tyson began reporting international results separately in the second  quarter of fiscal 2014. The segment will consist of chicken operations in China  and India following the divestiture of operations in Mexico and Brazil. Liquidity, Maturities and Debt Terms Tyson's liquidity at June 28, 2014 consisted of $587 million of cash and  availability under a $1 billion unsecured revolver, which Fitch believes was  undrawn. Significant upcoming maturities are limited to $638 million of 6.6%  senior unsecured notes due April 1, 2016. All of Hillshire's unsecured notes,  except the 6.125% notes due 2033, include a change of control triggering event  provision. Tyson will not have to redeem Hillshire's outstanding bonds, given  that the bond provisions require a downgrade to non-investment grade by all  three agencies. Tyson's revolving facility expires Aug. 9, 2017. The facility is guaranteed by  Tyson and its Tyson Fresh Meats (TFM) subsidiary as long as TFM guarantees the  $638 million 2016 and $1 billion 2022 senior unsecured notes. Tyson's $120  million 7% notes due 2018 and $18 million 7% notes due 2028 do not benefit from  a TFM guarantee. Fitch does not delineate ratings based on these guarantees due  to Tyson's strong credit protection measures and low probability of default. On June 27, 2014, Tyson amended its credit agreement to allow for the  acquisition of Hillshire. Changes included, among other things, the elimination  of certain limitations related to the incurrence of debt and increasing the  maximum debt-to-capitalization from 50% to 65% through the first full quarter  following the closing of the Hillshire transaction and 60% thereafter. The  previous ratings-based collateral trigger was eliminated and a priority debt  basket of 15% of consolidated net tangible assets was added. Fitch estimates  that debt-to-capitalization was approximately 21% at June 28, 2014. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to an  upgrade include: --An upgrade is not likely in the next 12-18 months due to the meaningful  increased leverage following the acquisition of Hillshire and potential  integration risk. However, factors that could lead to a rating upgrade include: --Realization of $500 million or more of expected synergies;  --100 bps or more of EBITDA margin expansion;  --Annualized FCF averaging around $800 million over time; --Greater than expected debt reduction and operating income growth such that  total debt-to-operating EBITDA is sustainable at around 2x or lower; --The maintenance of $1 billion or more of liquidity. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  negative rating action include: --Weak top-line growth or significant margin contraction due to prolonged supply  or demand imbalances resulting from animal diseases or higher feed cost and  substantially lower than expected FCF such that total debt-to-operating EBITDA  is sustained above approximately 2.5x; --Additional material size acquisitions over the near term or aggressive  financial policies relating to dividends and share repurchases would be viewed  negatively. Tyson's ratings are as follows: --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'BBB'; --Unsecured bank facility 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured notes 'BBB'; --Short-term IDR 'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

68,"   By Danielle Robinson  NEW YORK, Aug 8 (IFR) - Why a company like Tyson Foods will jump through hoops to keep an investment-grade rating was made blindingly clear last week, when the high-grade new-issue market shrugged off mayhem in the junk bond market and priced almost US$23bn of deals.After managing to cling on to its Triple B ratings, Tyson received US$20bn of orders from investors for its offering of US$3.25bn of five, 10, 20 and 30-year notes.Had it not cared about being junk-rated by one of the major ratings agencies, it would have faced a high-yield market littered with pulled deals and plunging secondary prices as a record US$7bn fled the riskier asset class.""There has been a huge bifurcation between the two markets,"" said Jonathan Fine, head of investment-grade debt syndicate at Goldman Sachs. ""Although the large outflow number [of US$7bn] for high-yield could make for more challenging times, I don't expect it will stop borrowers from tapping the investment-grade market.""The major difference between the two markets, according to analysts and bankers, is the technicals. While high-yield bonds have succumbed to over-valuation fears and geopolitical concerns, investment-grade funds have continued to see inflows and benefit from investors seeking high quality as Treasury yields remain low.""The technical backdrop for investment grade is much stronger than that for high-yield, with the latter more sensitive to total returns and retail fund flows,"" said Sivan Mahadevan, head of credit strategy at Morgan Stanley in the US. ""Investment grade, on the other hand, could see significant institutional demand at higher and lower rates.""When rates are low, money flows out of the Treasury market and into the next highest quality fixed-income asset class - investment-grade corporate bonds. And when rates rise, outflows from retail is offset by institutional investors coming in for the higher yields. Good execution of deals also goes a long way to generating goodwill in the new issue market.The sheer weight of orders brought in by bookrunners JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley helped Tyson's deal tighten in 9bp in the aftermarket.The next day, GE's credit card spin-off, Synchrony Financial, debuted with a US$3.6bn offering of three, five, seven and 10-year notes, which attracted as much as US$17.4bn of demand and tightened as much as 12bp in the aftermarket. ""The performance of Tyson and Synchrony really left a good taste in investors' mouths and now we've seen nine opportunistic issuers come to market today,"" said one head of syndicate. ""Tyson and Synchrony helped to take the focus away from three other deals [Comcast, American Tower and Discover Financial Services] that widened slightly during the week.""The week ahead is expected to be busy, with corporates squeezing in offerings ahead of the usual late August slowdown.""We expect the new-issue market to stay open [in the weeks ahead], although heightened geopolitical risk could increase the size of new-issue concessions,"" said Dan Mead, senior syndicate manager at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Investment-grade buyers are as concerned as the next investor about geopolitical risks. But with money to put to work, it usually just takes slightly higher new-issue concessions to reel them into new deals.As in other times of volatility and nervousness, syndicate managers will persuade borrowers to offer some extra spread over fair value, and smooth treasurers' feathers by noting how much the Treasury market has rallied.

China requires third-party verification that U.S. pork imports are ractopamine-free.""We’re confident about the safety and quality of our pork and will work with the USDA to try to resolve China’s concerns,"" Tyson spokesman Gary Mickelson said in an email statement. ""In the meantime, we’ll find other markets for our products.""The company did not immediately respond to requests Friday for further details on which markets Tyson may be pursuing, how big of a market China is for Tyson's pork exports, or whether there are pork deliveries currently in transit needing to be re-routed.How much China's recent bans will impact the United States' third-largest market for pork exports is unclear, say traders.  In 2013, U.S. pork exports to China, excluding Hong Kong, totaled 312,138 tonnes, valued at $645.3 million, according to the Global Trade Atlas. Overall pork exports worldwide last year totaled 7.5 million tonnes valued at $20.4 billion.But the ban comes at a critical time for meat exporters after Russia slapped a one-year ban on meat, including pork, from the West in retaliation for sanctions imposed for its support of rebels in eastern Ukraine. The appetite for U.S. pork, they said, remains strong in Japan and Mexico.Tyson's pork packing plants currently ineligible to export to China include its facilities in Perry and Storm Lake, Iowa, and Logansport, Indiana. China has also banned pork from a Hormel Foods Corp (HRL.N) plant in Fremont, Nebraska; Triumph Foods in St. Joseph, Missouri; and Quality Pork Processors Inc in Austin, Minnesota.Hormel, Quality Pork Processors and Triumph did not respond to requests for comment.How long the Chinese ban of these plants will remain in place is not known.

To win approval for the merger, the companies agreed to sell Heinold Hog Markets, the U.S. Department of Justice said. The attorneys general of Iowa, Illinois and Missouri, all big hog-producing states, joined the settlement. ""Today's proposed settlement will help ensure that hog breeders in the United States will continue to receive the benefits of vigorous competition when selling sows,"" said Bill Baer, assistant attorney general for DOJ's antitrust division.The two companies combined buy about 35 percent of all sows sold in the United States. Tyson's share price rallied on the approval, rising as much as 2 percent before closing at $37.71, up 1.5 percent. Hillshire closed near steady at $62.96. But about 10 minutes before the Justice Department announced the deal, the share prices of both companies dropped sharply and there was a large increase in stock and options volume, suggesting that traders were bracing for bad news. Trading volume for Hillshire totaled 8.07 million shares, compared with the 50-day average of 2.54 million; of the total,  trading volume, almost 5.5 million came several minutes before and after the DOJ's release, according to Reuters data.     Springdale, Arkansas-based Tyson is a massive seller of chicken, beef and pork while Chicago's Hillshire sells packaged meat brands such as Jimmy Dean, Ball Park and State Fair as well as bakery products like Sara Lee. The companies overlap in the business of buying sows when they are too old to breed, the Justice Department said. Heinold Hog Markets, which had revenues of $270 million and has operations in Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota and Nebraska, buys the animals from farmers and resells them to manufacturers. Hillshire buys them to make sausage for its Jimmy Dean and Hillshire Farm brands. ""Although the sale of sows constitutes a small percentage of overall revenues, farmers rely on this source of income as an important contribution to their earnings,"" the Justice Department said in a competitive impact statement filed with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.That court must approve the proposed settlement.

80,"   By Diane Bartz | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Tyson Foods Inc (TSN.N), the largest U.S. meat processor, on Wednesday won U.S. antitrust approval for its $8.5 billion purchase of Hillshire Brands Co HSH.N. To win approval for the merger, the companies agreed to sell Heinold Hog Markets, the U.S. Department of Justice said. The attorneys general of Iowa, Illinois and Missouri, all big hog-producing states, joined the settlement. ""Today's proposed settlement will help ensure that hog breeders in the United States will continue to receive the benefits of vigorous competition when selling sows,"" said Bill Baer, assistant attorney general for DOJ's antitrust division.The two companies combined buy about 35 percent of all sows sold in the United States. Tyson's share price rallied on the approval, rising as much as 2 percent before closing at $37.71, up 1.5 percent. Hillshire closed near steady at $62.96. But about 10 minutes before the Justice Department announced the deal, the share prices of both companies dropped sharply and there was a large increase in stock and options volume, suggesting that traders were bracing for bad news. Trading volume for Hillshire totaled 8.07 million shares, compared with the 50-day average of 2.54 million; of the total,  trading volume, almost 5.5 million came several minutes before and after the DOJ's release, according to Reuters data.     Springdale, Arkansas-based Tyson is a massive seller of chicken, beef and pork while Chicago's Hillshire sells packaged meat brands such as Jimmy Dean, Ball Park and State Fair as well as bakery products like Sara Lee. The companies overlap in the business of buying sows when they are too old to breed, the Justice Department said. Heinold Hog Markets, which had revenues of $270 million and has operations in Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota and Nebraska, buys the animals from farmers and resells them to manufacturers. Hillshire buys them to make sausage for its Jimmy Dean and Hillshire Farm brands. ""Although the sale of sows constitutes a small percentage of overall revenues, farmers rely on this source of income as an important contribution to their earnings,"" the Justice Department said in a competitive impact statement filed with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.That court must approve the proposed settlement. The deal had came under fire from some farm, consumer and rural organizations, as well as lawmakers like Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa, who worried that a larger Tyson will have power to push down the prices paid to hog farmers and drive up the prices paid by consumers at the grocery store.""Because Tyson can align its pork slaughter business with Hillshire’s branded processing business, Hillshire products will have a leg up on competitors, who will likely have to raise prices,"" said Wenonah Hunter, executive director of Food & Water Watch. In a statement, Grassley said that requiring the sale of Heinold showed the Justice Department ""took my concerns into consideration in regard to the slaughter sow market.""

In those two games, his ERA climbed from 2.60 to 2.81.On Saturday in Arizona, Ross gave up six runs (four earned) on five hits and two walks in just three innings -- his shortest outing of the season.""We're going to push Tyson back a few days,"" Black said. ""After his last start, Tyson felt general soreness in his arm. ... He was a little tired. We talked. I didn't think he looked tired. His velocity was OK (topping at 97 mph on his fastball in Arizona). He wasn't as crisp. He's had better command than that. There were indicators.""Tyson has pitched a lot more innings this year than ever before, and in close games. It's a grind. We just came to a decision to give him more time.""Ross has pitched 195 2/3 innings this season. The most he worked previously as a pro was 151 2/3. Had Ross made his final three starts, he would have equaled the most starts by a Padres pitcher since Kevin Brown made 35 starts in 1998.Left-hander Robbie Erlin will make Ross' scheduled start Thursday.

It's going to be expensive and may take longer than planned: switching to antibiotic-free chickens could increase on-farm costs by up to 3 percent. Perdue Farms, a supplier with about a third the volume of Tyson, told Reuters it's taken more than a decade and millions of dollars to make such a change.McDonald's will use its purchasing muscle as the world's largest restaurant chain to avoid passing extra costs on to customers, increasingly lower income as more affluent diners prefer competitors like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc, said analysts including Morningstar's R.J. Hottovy.Marion Gross, McDonald's senior vice president of North America supply chain management, declined to say how much the company’s costs for chicken could rise. Rather, she told Reuters, the project is ""an investment"" to meet customer demand.While veterinary use of antibiotics is legal, controversy has grown over routine feeding of antibiotics that are important to humans to otherwise healthy chicken, cattle and pigs in a bid to stave off disease and help the animals grow more quickly.The risk is that overuse could spur the creation of so-called superbugs that develop cross-resistance to antibiotics used to treat humans. Reuters found last year that major U.S. poultry firms were administering antibiotics to their flocks on the farm far more pervasively than regulators realized.The poultry industry maintains there is little evidence that bacteria which do become resistant also infect people. However, more restaurants and retailers are heeding the concerns of consumers, straining meat supplies.Sandwich chain Chick-fil-A in 2014 gave its producers five years to meet its commitment to go antibiotic-free for chicken. Perdue is a major supplier to Chick-fil-A.Costco Wholesale Corp., the nation's third-largest retailer that annually sells 80 million rotisserie chickens, told Reuters Thursday it has a ""large"" appetite for chicken free of these medically-important antibiotics. The company is aware of the supply difficulties and won't commit to a timeline, said Craig Wilson, vice president of food safety for Costco.WHO PAYS THE PRICE? Some of the extra costs of cutting out antibiotics could be borne by franchisees, which could cut labor hours, waste and utility costs to offset higher meat prices. But most analysts expect McDonald's to push the costs back onto its suppliers, who may not have the market power to resist. The top four U.S. chicken processors control about 53 percent of the domestic market, according to the National Chicken Council.McDonald's ""carries a lot of clout with suppliers,"" and some of them are dependent on the chain for survival, Hottovy said.Tyson and Keystone Foods, part of Brazil-based Marfrig Global Foods SA, both told Reuters they have significantly reduced medically-important antibiotic use in their flocks and are positioned to meet McDonald's and other customers' needs. However, neither company would answer specific questions about how such drugs are used on-farm and in hatcheries.SLOW CHANGES  Perdue, the fourth-largest domestic chicken producer, began removing antibiotics used for growth promotion in 2002 amid consumer questions about what was being put into the animal feed, said Bruce Stewart-Brown, senior vice-president of food safety, quality and live operations.Now more than 95 percent of the chickens it produces are raised without antibiotics approved for human use, and more than half are raised with no antibiotics of any kind, according to the company.The transition led to unexpectedly high bird mortality rates, a need for more chicken houses and spending at least $4 million more a year on vaccines than rivals who haven't made the switch, among other things. Birds raised without antibiotics also generally take three to nine days longer to reach their market weight, Stewart-Brown told Reuters -- or as much as 20 percent longer than conventionally raised birds.McDonald's two-year deadline is ""a really fast timeframe to do it right and be predictable to your customers and your supply,"" Stewart-Brown said.Birds raised on farms without antibiotics take longer to reach optimal slaughter weight, resulting in higher feed costs and death rates, forcing companies to ramp up with more eggs at the hatcheries, said Tom Elam of FarmEcon, an agricultural consulting company.""The ones that aren't quite as good with keeping up with their biosecurity, it's going to cause some issues,"" Elam said.

99,"   By P.J. Huffstutter | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Tyson Foods Inc has removed gentamicin, a key antibiotic for human use, from company hatcheries, the company told Reuters on Tuesday.Arkansas-based Tyson, the nation's largest chicken producer, said the drug and other antibiotics have not been used at its 35 hatcheries since Oct. 1, 2014. The company had not previously given details of what drugs were used at the hatcheries, where chicks are born and kept briefly before being moved to poultry farms.Gentamicin is a member of an antibiotic class considered ""highly important"" in human medicine by the federal Food and Drug Administration.The poultry industry has long been under pressure to stop feeding medically important antibiotics to otherwise healthy livestock. Meat companies have used the drugs both to stave off disease and to promote more rapid growth. Last week, McDonald's Corp said its U.S. restaurants will gradually stop buying chicken raised with antibiotics vital to fighting human infections. Tyson Foods is a major chicken supplier to McDonald's.Tyson told Reuters this week it is also testing alternatives to medically-important antibiotics for use on the farms that house its chickens after they leave the hatcheries. It says it does not use antibiotics for growth promotion on the farms, but does use them, according to its website, ""when prescribed by a veterinarian to treat or prevent disease.""Rival chicken producer Perdue Farms announced last summer that it had stopped using all antibiotics in its hatcheries, including gentamicin, because it wanted ""to move away from conventional antibiotic use"" due to ""growing consumer concern and our own questions about the practice."" Gentamicin has been commonly used in hatcheries to fight off infection or prevent disease, including in fertilized eggs, livestock veterinarians and other poultry producers say.Tyson sees the policy shift as ""a significant first step toward our goal of reducing the use of antibiotics that are also used in human medicine,"" according to its website. Tyson has reduced the volume of medically-important antibiotics used in its chicken business by 84 percent since 2011 and the ""vast majority of the antibiotics used to raise our chickens are never used in humans,"" according to a company statement.While veterinary use of antibiotics is legal, the risk is that overuse could spur the creation of so-called superbugs that develop cross-resistance to antibiotics used to treat humans.

101,"  (Updates with Tyson comment in paragraph 9)By Tom Polansek and P.J. HuffstutterCHICAGO A suspected case of avian influenza has been identified in poultry in Arkansas, the third-largest U.S. turkey producer and home to Tyson Foods Inc, the nation's biggest chicken company, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Tuesday.The infection, if confirmed, threatens to widen trading restrictions from countries such as Taiwan, Singapore and Nicaragua that have already limited U.S. poultry exports due to bird flu outbreaks in states ranging from Minnesota and Missouri to California.""There is a suspect case in Arkansas, but testing is ongoing,"" USDA spokeswoman Lyndsay Cole said.Arkansas producers have been on alert for the virus since Minnesota and Missouri confirmed cases of highly pathogenic H5N2 bird flu in the past week. The Minnesota case was the first in the Mississippi flyway, a migratory route along the Mississippi River that also includes Missouri and Arkansas. Bird flu is contagious and can spread rapidly through a flock, killing birds in as little as 48 hours. The virus has not been identified in humans and is not expected to pose a public health risk, according to USDA.""It's in the wild bird flyway coming from Canada,"" Texas state veterinarian Dee Ellis said of the virus. ""That's obviously how it went from Minnesota to Missouri to Arkansas."" Ellis could not confirm the Arkansas case.On Wednesday, Texas will announce strengthened testing requirements for poultry coming in from states with bird flu outbreaks in a bid to keep out the virus, he said.No flocks grown for Tyson have been diagnosed with bird flu, spokesman Worth Sparkman said, adding the company had become more diligent about biosecurity at poultry farms because of the virus. The suspected case in Arkansas was found in a turkey flock, said Mike Cockrell, chief financial officer for Sanderson Farms Inc, the nation's third-largest poultry producer. He cited information from the Texas Poultry Federation.To prevent bird flu from spreading to its facilities, Sanderson is starting to bar outsiders from entering barns and to require increased cleaning of trucks hauling feed and chickens between farms, Cockrell said. In the past, employees have changed their clothes on airplanes after visiting infected locations, he added.Transmission ""can happen, whether it comes in on feces on your boot or a piece of a feather that got on a shirt when you're out doing environmental inspections on a farm,"" Cockrell said.H5N2 was also found in turkey flocks in Minnesota and Missouri.

102,"  CHICAGO The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Wednesday confirmed the discovery of highly pathogenic avian influenza in a commercial turkey flock in Arkansas, the third-largest U.S. turkey producer and home to Tyson Foods Inc, the nation's biggest chicken company.Shares of Tyson and other poultry companies, including Pilgrim's Pride Corp and Sanderson Farms Inc, tumbled on concerns the discovery will further limit U.S. trade with Asia and Latin America. Tyson's stock price fell 5.6 percent to $37.55 after hitting a five-month low of $37.35. The infected flock of 40,020 turkeys in Boone County, Arkansas, is located within the Mississippi flyway, a migratory route along which the same strain of H5N2 bird flu was previously identified in Minnesota and Missouri. Arkansas officials quarantined the affected premises and birds on the property will be culled to prevent the spread of the disease, according to USDA. Birds from the flock will not enter the food system. In response to the news, Japan's farm ministry halted imports of live poultry and poultry meat from Arkansas from Thursday, a ministry official said. It has already imposed bans on imports from nine other states, including Minnesota, Missouri and Kansas this month, its website showed. Other countries such as the Philippines, Taiwan, Singapore and Nicaragua have also restricted poultry exports from U.S. states that have suffered bird flu outbreaks, including California and Oregon. A spokesman for the Philippines' Department of Agriculture said its ban would probably be extended to Arkansas once it had received formal notification of the outbreak there.

103,"  (Repeats for additional subscribers)By Lisa Baertlein and P.J. HuffstutterLOS ANGELES/CHICAGO, March 12 KFC, the world's largest chain of fried chicken restaurants, may face pressure from consumer and environmental groups to change how its poultry are raised after McDonald's Corp said it would switch to chicken raised without human antibiotics.McDonald's will phase out chicken raised with antibiotics that are important to human health over two years to allay concern that use of the drugs in meat production has exacerbated the rise of deadly ""superbugs"" that resist treatment, Reuters reported last week. Within days, retailer Costco Wholesale Corp told Reuters it aims to eliminate the sale of chicken and meat raised with human antibiotics. [ID: nL1N0W731Y]KFC is owned by Louisville, Kentucky-based Yum Brands Inc , which has no publicly stated policy on antibiotic use in the production of meat it buys. Chick-fil-A, another chicken restaurant chain that competes with KFC, says about 20 percent of the chicken it serves is raised without any antibiotics, and that its entire supply chain will be converted by 2019.Both McDonald's and Yum are stepping up efforts to win back younger and wealthier diners lured away by chains such as such as Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc and Panera Bread Co , which boast antibiotic-free meats and other high-quality ingredients. Yum's KFC restaurants in China two years ago suffered a massive sales hit following local media reports that a few poultry farmers supplying KFC fed excessive levels of antibiotics to their chickens.""The train has left the station,"" Bob Goldin, a food services company consultant at Technomic in Chicago, said of McDonald's influence on U.S. chicken production standards.Yum, which also owns the Taco Bell and Pizza Hut chains, declined to discuss its standards for antibiotic use in meat production. ""The chicken served in our U.S. restaurants is USDA high quality, and free of antibiotics,"" the company said in an emailed response to Reuters queries.The antibiotic-free statement refers to a lack of residue in the meat served at its restaurants and not the practice of delivering antibiotics to chickens before they are slaughtered, said Steven Roach, food safety program director at Food Animal Concerns Trust in Chicago.The U.S. Department of Agriculture has three classifications for poultry, A, B, and C, and doesn't have a ""high quality"" designation for chicken. Poultry rated A is what's typically found at retail, while poultry rated B or C is usually used in further-processed products where the meat is cut up, chopped, or ground, according to a USDA website. NOT PART OF THE CONVERSATION McDonald's told Reuters it worked with a wide range of stakeholders, including environmental group Friends of the Earth, to develop its U.S. chicken guidelines. Yum and its brands have ignored requests for information regarding its antibiotic policy, said Kari Hamerschlag, senior program manager for Friends of the Earth's food and technology program.""They have so far not answered any of our emails or phone calls,"" said Hamerschlag, who is working with other advocacy groups to persuade food companies to change their supplier standards to exclude animals raised with the routine use of antibiotics. By contrast, McDonald's was ""very responsive"" to the groups' requests, she said.Other groups working with Friends of the Earth to cut antibiotics from chickens and other meats include the Natural Resources Defense Council, Consumers Union and the Center for Food Safety. Friends of the Earth said its interest in antibiotics has to do with animal agriculture's connection to the environment and human health. KFC supplier Tyson Foods Inc did not comment. Other U.S. chicken producers that have supplied Yum either declined to comment or could not be reached. It's not known who KFC's biggest supplier is or how many chickens KFC buys a year.In 2012, Chinese media reports about excessive antibiotic use by a few KFC chicken farmers hammered sales there. The country has more than 4,800 KFC restaurants and accounted for nearly half of Yum's 2014 operating profit. In response, Yum dropped some 1,000 small poultry farmers from its supply chain and launched a public relations campaign to reassure diners about the quality and safety of its food.Yum operates separate supply chains in China and United States. While antibiotics have made for big headlines in China, the issue also has surfaced at home.A Reuters investigation last year found that KFC supplier Koch Foods Inc from November 2011 to July 2014 had given some of its flocks antibiotics critical to fighting human infections, even though its website stated otherwise.The Chicago-based chicken producer changed the language on its website after questions from Reuters about its use of virginiamycin, an antibiotic included in a class considered ""highly important"" to fighting infections in humans. At the time, Koch said it has no plans to discontinue the use of virginiamycin, which it says may be used to prevent a common intestinal infection in chicken.Koch did not respond to interview requests for this story.KFC US said at the time that its ""supply partners must adhere to our strict standards and specifications, which in some cases are more stringent than the FDA's regulations.""

Huffstutter | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Tyson Foods Inc, the largest U.S. poultry producer, plans to eliminate the use of human antibiotics in its chicken flocks by September 2017 - one of the most aggressive timelines yet set by an American poultry company.The Arkansas-based chicken and meat giant also said it is working on ways to curtail such on-farm drug practices at its other protein businesses, which include pork and beef.The move marks the latest push by the livestock and food industries to reduce the use of antibiotics crucial to human health in meat production. Authorities are concerned that the routine feeding of antibiotics to animals could spur the creation of antibiotic resistant superbugs in humans, creating a health hazard.Tyson's move, announced on Tuesday morning, aims to help the company meet a deadline recently outlined by McDonald's Corp. to have its U.S. restaurants gradually stop buying chicken raised with human antibiotics over the next two years. But the company, a key chicken supplier to McDonald's, said in a statement to Reuters that its plans are part of an ongoing effort and ""go beyond one customer.""Tyson said it is also forming working groups with independent farmers, company suppliers, veterinarians and others to talk about how to develop ideas to cut the use of antibiotics vital to fighting human infections in its U.S. beef, pork and turkey supply chains.The working groups will begin meeting this summer. While veterinary use of antibiotics is legal, controversy has grown over the routine feeding of antibiotics that are important to humans to otherwise healthy chicken, cattle and pigs in a bid to stave off disease and help the animals grow more quickly.Tyson said it has already stopped using all antibiotics in its 35 broiler hatcheries and has cut human antibiotics used to treat its broiler chickens by more than 80 percent since 2011. The company said it requires a veterinary prescription when antibiotics are used on its broiler farms.""Given the progress we've already made reducing antibiotics in our broilers, we believe it's realistic to shoot for zero by the end of our 2016 fiscal year,"" Donnie Smith, president and chief executive of Tyson Foods, said in a statement. INDUSTRY SHIFTS Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Pilgrim's Pride Corp., the nation's second-largest U.S. poultry processor, would cut all antibiotics from a quarter of its chicken production by 2019.Rival poultry processor Perdue Farms Inc. told Reuters more than 95 percent of the chickens it produces are raised without antibiotics approved for human use, and more than half are raised with no antibiotics of any kind. Sandwich chain Chick-fil-A in 2014 gave its producers five years to meet its commitment to go antibiotic-free for chicken. Perdue is a major supplier to Chick-fil-A. Tyson has been working with livestock drug companies and others to test a variety of alternatives to antibiotics to protect birds, ranging from probiotics to essential oils derived from plant extracts, the company told Reuters.However, alternatives to human antibiotics are also needed for treating ill birds, the company said. It is providing funds to help accelerate research into disease prevention and antibiotic alternatives to be used on farms.Tyson declined to say how much the company will spend to buch such funding of livestock pharmaceuticals and alternatives. Some poultry industry experts say the options for non-human drugs to treat certain diseases in broiler chickens can be limited, and say animal pharmaceutical firms have been slow to invest for the development of new chicken-only antibiotics.Tyson said it plans to meet its 2017 antibiotic-withdrawal timeline, but there could be some exceptions.""We won't jeopardize animal well-being just to get there,"" Smith said. ""We'll use the best available treatments to keep our chickens healthy, under veterinary supervision."" (Reporting By P.J. Huffstutter in Chicago.

121,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Tyson Foods Inc (TSN.N), the biggest U.S. meat processor, cut its full-year profit forecast after posting its slowest sales growth in nine quarters as customers overseas refused to accept shipments delayed by West Coast port disruptions.During the disruptions, Asian buyers were importing meat from other countries and were overwhelmed with supply after the port issues ended in February, Tyson Chief Executive Donnie Smith said on a call on Monday.Tyson was forced to cut prices and take a hit to margins in the third quarter to clear ""significant"" inventory, said Smith, adding that conditions had not improved much so far in the current quarter.The company's shares, which have been trading at record highs over the past month, fell nearly 11 percent.Tyson reported a lower-than-expected profit for the April to June quarter due to losses in its beef business, its biggest by sales and worth about 24 percent of operating profit last year. Beef sales volumes fell 3.9 percent in the quarter and the business posted an operating loss of $7 million, also hurt by low cattle supply.Tyson's total sales rose 4 percent to $10.07 billion in the quarter. The company's sales have grown more than 10 percent in the past four quarters, helped by record high beef prices as the U.S. cattle population fell due to years of drought.But the high domestic prices, low cattle supply and a strong dollar hurt exports. U.S. beef exports declined 14.4 percent in May and will likely remain constrained, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said last month. (bit.ly/1Dksc7O) Smith said U.S. beef supplies will remain tight until the second half of 2016.Springdale, Arkansas-based Tyson cut its full-year adjusted earnings forecast to $3.10-$3.20 per share from $3.30-$3.40.Net income attributable to Tyson rose 32 percent to $343 million, or 83 cents per share, in the third quarter.

123,"  (Adds comment from Tyson Foods, paragraph 6)Aug 14 Tyson Foods Inc on Friday said it is permanently ceasing beef production at its plant in Denison, Iowa, effective immediately, as cattle ranchers work to rebuild shrunken herds following the severe Midwestern drought.The move by Tyson, the biggest U.S. meat processor, will affect 400 employees at the plant, which will continue by-product rendering operations with about 20 workers.Such closures are becoming more common since fewer cattle are available for slaughter due to several years of drought that hurt feed crops and forced ranchers to trim their herds.""The cattle supply is tight and there's an excess of beef production capacity in the region,"" Steve Stouffer, president of Tyson Fresh Meats, said in a statement. Tyson's Denison plant has a daily estimated slaughter capacity of about 2,000 head of cattle over a five-day work week, which represent 2 percent of U.S. steer and heifer slaughter capacity, according to industry experts.""While we won't share what percentage of our total production comes from Denison, we can tell you it's our smallest beef plant,"" Gary Mickelson, a spokesman for the company said. Animals that will no longer be processed at the plant likely will be transferred to Tyson's other nearby locations, including the newly expanded facility in Dakota City, Nebraska. That plant has an estimated daily kill capacity of 6,000 head, the experts said.Last year, the U.S. cattle herd sank to its lowest level since 1951 at roughly 89 million head based on the government's Jan. 1 inventory report. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's semi-annual cattle report confirmed a turnaround in U.S. cattle herd size. As of July 1 it stood at 98.4 million head, up 2 percent from a year ago, thanks to cheaper feed and healthy grazing pastures.The 400 affected Denison plant workers will have opportunities to apply for jobs at other Tyson plants, the company said.Cargill Inc, one of the country's largest beef processors, on July 30 announced the closure of its Milwaukee, Wisconsin, beef-processing plant due to cattle shortages.Shares of Tyson closed up 0.5 percent at $42.50 on the News York Stock Exchange.

125,"  (Adds Tyson statement)By Jonathan StempelAug 26 Tyson Foods Inc, one of the world's largest meat processors, on Wednesday won the reversal of nearly $24 million of damage awards in two class action lawsuits claiming it cheated thousands of hourly workers in two Nebraska plants out of wages.The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis overturned an $18.77 million award to workers at a Madison, Nebraska pork processing plant after a non-jury trial.It also threw out a $4.96 million award concerning a Dakota City, Nebraska beef processing plant, following a jury trial. Two-thirds of that sum went to workers and the rest to the state. Workers accused Tyson of failing to pay them properly for ""K-code time,"" representing pre- and post-shift activities such as putting on and taking off required clothing; cleaning and maintaining equipment; and walking to and from the production line, lockers and wash stations.Writing for a three-judge appeals court panel, Circuit Judge Steven Colloton found insufficient evidence of an agreement for Tyson to pay wages sought by the Madison workers, and no evidence of such an agreement for the Dakota City workers. He said the district court misinterpreted the Nebraska Wage Payment and Collection Act, which lets workers sue for unpaid wages. As a result, Colloton said the Tyson workers' claims failed as a matter of law.A lawyer for workers in both lawsuits did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Tyson spokesman Gary Mickelson said the Springdale, Arkansas-based company is pleased with the decisions.""We continue to believe we're paying our people appropriately and, like other businesses, have strived to comply with federal wage and hour laws that are not precise in describing what activities should be compensated,"" he said.Tyson is appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court a $5.8 million award in a wage dispute at a Storm Lake, Iowa pork processing plant.

129,"   By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Oct 2 Big business is urging the U.S. Supreme Court to curb class action litigation in a series of cases that dominate the nine justices' business docket in the coming months.The court returns for its new term on Monday with three major class action cases already scheduled for oral arguments this fall.In other business cases of interest that will decided before the term ends in June, the nine justices will hear a challenge to government regulation of the electricity markets and decide whether civil racketeering laws can apply to a company's actions overseas.The class action cases give the conservative-leaning court another opportunity to cut back on such litigation, as it has done in a series of rulings in recent years. The most significant of those handed victories to Wal Mart Stores Inc and Comcast Corp.In all three new cases, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business groups have filed court papers backing the businesses sued by workers and consumers.""This is an area of the court's docket we have been pushing and trying to encourage the court to push back the worst abuses of the class action tool,"" said Kate Comerford Todd, a lawyer with the chamber's litigation arm.The business community characterizes class actions as driven largely by specialist plaintiffs' lawyers, who file claims on behalf of groups of consumers over such issues as defective products and unfair business practices. If successful, lawyers can make millions of dollars in legal fees. Individual plaintiffs generally recover much less, but supporters of the practice say it can be the only way consumers can pursue grievances against deep-pocketed companies.Paul Bland, executive director of the consumer advocacy group Public Justice, said all three of the new cases are seeking ""fairly dramatic change to the law that will really hammer class actions.""TYSON CASE  In one of the cases, the court in November will consider Tyson Foods Inc's appeal of a $5.8 million judgment against the company over worker pay at an Iowa meat-processing facility. Tyson objects to the use of statistics to determine damages instead of assessing individual damages for each plaintiff. A win for Tyson could have a broad impact on similar disputes.Another case the court will hear in November involves online people-search service Spokeo Inc. It focuses on whether plaintiffs can sue for a technical violation of federal law even when they cannot show they have been harmed economically.Business including Facebook Inc and Google Inc joined friend-of-the-court briefs backing Spokeo's position, saying allowing such lawsuits to go forward encourages abuse of the class action process. The third case concerns alleged violations of a federal consumer law by advertising agency Campbell-Ewald Co. The court will weigh during Oct. 14 oral arguments whether litigation ends if the named plaintiff is offered the maximum available damages. That means the case would not continue as a class action lawsuit that would potentially benefit multiple plaintiffs.Consumer advocates say a ruling for the company would allow defendants to nip class action lawsuits in the bud.Another case that has attracted business interest is the challenge to an Obama administration regulation aimed at encouraging efficiency in the electricity market by having electrical grid operators pay users to reduce consumption at peak times.The regulation concerns what the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission calls ""demand-response,"" which is when, in an attempt to manage demand for electricity, regional electrical grid operators agree to pay electricity users to cut consumption at peak times.The dispute, also to be heard by the justices on Oct. 14, has businesses lined up on both sides, with some trade groups that represent utilities opposed to the regulation and some utilities and companies that benefit from the payments backing the government.In a case the justices added to their calendar on Thursday, the court will decide whether a lawsuit filed by European Union countries accusing cigarette maker R.J. Reynolds of running a global money-laundering scheme involving narcotics smuggling into Europe can move forward.The case could affect other cases in which U.S. federal civil racketeering laws have been used to sue over conduct that takes place overseas.

130,"   By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. Supreme Court justices expressed skepticism on Tuesday toward Tyson Foods Inc's challenge to an almost $5.8 million class action judgment in a case that could buck the court's recent pro-business trend in such disputes.Conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy, who often casts the deciding vote in close cases before the nine-member court, and the four liberal justices appeared hostile to Tyson's claims during a one-hour oral argument. Tyson is appealing a jury verdict over claims that it underpaid workers at an Iowa pork facility.Based on questions asked by the justices, the case is unlikely to lead to a ruling cutting back on class action litigation, a goal for a business community eager to rein in big-money payouts in such lawsuits. Kennedy could hold the key vote in handing a possible narrow victory to the plaintiffs. Kennedy expressed concerns about  Tyson's legal strategy, telling attorney Carter Phillips at one point: ""I just don't understand your arguments.""A ruling along the lines suggested by Kennedy's questions likely would not have a broad impact on class actions in general because it would be limited to wage cases similar to this one.The court is considering Tyson's objection to the use of statistics to determine liability and damages. Critics in the business community describe such use of statistics as ""trial by formula"" that violates defendants' due process rights, instead of assessing each claim individually for the more than 3,000 current and former employees who are suing.Workers at the meat-processing facility, which employs around 1,300 people, sued in 2007, claiming they were entitled to overtime pay and damages because they were not paid for time spent putting on and taking off protective equipment and walking to work stations. The ruling could turn on a 1946 Supreme Court precedent that said plaintiffs can rely on averages in such situations to determine claims under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act.Kennedy indicated a willingness to rule for the plaintiffs on that point. But he said without that precedent, ""it would be a much closer, more difficult case.""SAFETY GEAR  Liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg questioned Tyson's assertion that the workers should not be treated as a class because they had to wear different safety gear depending on their job, saying no ""wide disparity"" existed in such gear.Although some workers, including those charged with using knives, had different equipment, all employees had to wear hard hats, ear protection and boots, Ginsburg said.Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts, appearing more sympathetic to Tyson, highlighted the fact that jurors awarded less in damages than the plaintiffs' expert had suggested.""The fact that the jury did not give you the damages sought seems to me to call into question the significance of the statistics,"" Roberts told the plaintiffs' lawyer, David Frederick. The jury found in favor of the plaintiffs following a trial in a federal district court in Iowa in 2011.

140,"  * Deal valued at $975 mln, including debt* Pinnacle expects deal to add to earnings in 2016* Boulder Brands shares up 8.5 pct   (Adds details, background; updates shares)By Nayan DasNov 24 Pinnacle Foods Inc said it would buy Boulder Brands Inc, the maker of Udi's gluten-free products and Earth Balance vegan packaged foods, for about $710 million to expand its health and wellness offerings.Boulder Brands' shares rose 8.5 percent to $10.93 in morning trading on Tuesday, just below the offer price of $11. Pinnacle shares were down slightly at $42.93.With U.S. consumers increasingly turning health-conscious and shunning processed foods, companies are looking to add products that are perceived as healthier to their portfolios. Hormel Foods Corp said in May it would buy Applegate Farms LLC to meet demand for antibiotic- and hormone-free meat, while Campbell Soup Co announced the acquisition of organic salsa maker Garden Fresh Gourmet in June.Pinnacle, whose Hungry-Man and Birds Eye frozen meals are popular among consumers pressed for time, said the Boulder Brands deal would give it a ""new growth platform"" in the frozen foods segment.Boulder Brands' frozen foods include single-serve meals, burrito and egg-white breakfast items under the Evol brand.The transaction is valued at about $975 million including net debt of about $265 million. Boulder Brands, which had a market value of about $622 million as of Monday's close, reported its second straight fall in quarterly sales this month.Pinnacle said the deal was expected to add to its earnings from 2016. MEAL DEALS The acquisition is Pinnacle's first since it bought Canadian protein food maker Garden Protein International Inc in November last year and its biggest since the purchase of Wish-Bone salad dressings for $575 million in 2013.Jimmy Dean sausage maker Hillshire Brands Co made an attempt to buy Pinnacle last year, but dropped the bid after agreeing to be acquired by Tyson Foods Inc.Boulder Brands said in August it was exploring strategic and financial alternatives.Up to Monday's close, Boulder Brands shares had fallen about 9 percent this year, while Pinnacle's shares had risen about 22.5 percent.Perella Weinberg Partners LP was Pinnacle's financial adviser for the deal, while William Blair & Co LLC advised Boulder Brands.

141,"  (Adds Cargill beef plant shutdown, industry background, analysts' and economists' comments)By Theopolis WatersCHICAGO Feb 2 Blizzard conditions in the Central United States shut down some Cargill and Tyson beef and pork processing plants in the region, company spokesmen told Reuters by email on Tuesday.Tyson Foods Inc, one of the biggest U.S. meat processors, said three pork processing facilities and one beef plant were closed.""Three of our six pork plants are not operating today due to weather-related road conditions and one other plant will operate only one shift of production,"" said Tyson Foods spokesman Gary Mickelson.He said the affected pork plants are in Iowa and Nebraska. Mickelson added that one of the company's beef processing facilities is not operating and two others are scheduled to run reduced hours. Those plants are in Nebraska and Kansas, he said.Cargill Foods spokesman Mike Martin said its beef processing plant in Schuyler, Nebraska, was not running on Tuesday due to wintry weather, ""with adverse road conditions impacting employee travel safety and livestock transportation.""Smithfield Foods Inc, the world's largest pork processor and hog producer, said it does not comment on daily activities. Industry experts said other meat processors were likely affected by the storm, which could trim more than 40,000 hogs and roughly 25,000 cattle from the day's overall industry slaughter.They said companies affected by weather disruptions are expected to make up the downtime later in the week by increasing shift hours or adding to Saturday's slaughter.Winds of up to 50 mph whipped up as much as a foot of snow that fell in hardest-hit sections of Kansas, Nebraska and Iowa, said meteorologists. The majority of hogs are raised indoors, so the weather impact would be more associated with the ability to move pigs to packing plants, said Iowa State University economist Lee Schulz.Industry participants have known about the storm for several days and have planned accordingly, either by adjusting shifts or delivering pigs ahead of time, he said.For cattle that are exposed to the elements in feedlots, cold, wet weather can create muddy conditions that can cause stress.""Wind is as big an issue as snow,"" said Cassandra Fish, author of industry blog The Beef.Feedyards will focus on ensuring that cattle are fed and trying to move snow to keep alleys in feedyards clear. Cattle will slowly put on pounds with more of their feed intake directed at keeping warm than gaining weight, she said.

Shares of the company, which also reported a better-than-expected rise in quarterly profit, were up 12 percent at $58.15 in morning trading.Feed costs have fallen in the United States as a global glut of corn and soybeans has kept grain prices depressed for three straight years.However, Tyson's revenue fell 15.4 percent to $9.15 billion as higher domestic availability of cattle and hogs drove down average sales prices in the first quarter. Retail U.S. beef prices declined seven months in a row till December as healthy pastures, cheaper corn and record high cattle prices a year ago encouraged ranchers to bolster their herds.Cattle herds are also recovering after years of drought reduced supplies, which had fallen to a 63-year low in 2014. ""The worst is over in terms of the cattle supply,"" Tyson's Chief Executive Donnie Smith said on a conference call.  Tyson's beef business, its largest by sales, reported an operating profit of $71 million, compared with a loss of $6 million in the year-earlier period, due to lower livestock costs.

145,"   By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday handed a loss to Tyson Foods Inc (TSN.N) over the company's challenge to an almost $5.8 million class action judgment in a case won by workers at an Iowa pork-processing facility who contended they were underpaid.The court, in a 6-2 ruling written by conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy, upheld a 2014 appeals court decision in favor of the workers. It was one of three closely watched class action cases to come before the court during its current term, with business interests urging the justices to rein in such litigation.Of the three cases, the court has now ruled in two, with businesses losing both times. In January, the court ruled 6-3 against advertising firm Campbell-Ewald, saying a lawsuit could proceed over claims the company violated a federal consumer law by sending unsolicited text messages on behalf of the U.S. Navy.In the Tyson case, the court was considering an objection to the use of statistics to determine liability and damages. Critics in the business community have described such use of statistics as ""trial by formula"" that violates defendants' due process rights, instead of assessing each claim individually for the more than 3,000 current and former employees who are suing. The narrow ruling turned in part on a 1946 Supreme Court precedent that said plaintiffs can rely on averages in such situations to determine claims under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act. Kennedy said while corporate defendants ""may urge adoption of broad and categorical rules governing the use of representative and statistical evidence in class actions, this case provides no occasion to do so.""Kennedy said the ruling does not undercut the court's major 2011 ruling in favor of Wal Mart Stores Inc(WMT.N), which made it harder to bring class action cases.

158,"   By Barbara Grzincic  Hundreds of commissioned salespeople can sue Ashley Furniture Industries and its subsidiary, Stoneledge Furniture, as a class for allegedly violating California minimum wage laws, a federal appeals court ruled Wednesday. The furniture companies' attorneys at Littler Mendelson had argued that class certification was improper in light of two landmark U.S. Supreme Court rulings: Dukes v. Walmart in 2011, and Comcast v. Behrend in 2013. But, a unanimous panel three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed, saying the high court's April decision in Tyson Foods v.

161,"   By Tom Polansek | OAK BROOK, Ill.  OAK BROOK, Ill. McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) will replace corn syrup in hamburger buns with sugar this month and has removed antibiotics that are important to human medicine from its chicken months ahead of schedule, it said on Monday, moves that are part of its drive to target increasingly health-conscious consumers.    The fast food company also said it eliminated artificial preservatives from Chicken McNuggets and several breakfast items, including scrambled eggs.McDonald's is reacting to a shift in consumer tastes toward healthier, more natural foods and competing with other restaurants that are overhauling their menus to feature items free of processed ingredients.McDonald's USA President Mike Andres told reporters at the company's headquarters that the changes announced on Monday will affect about half its menu and more adjustments would follow. Some consumers have turned away from products containing high-fructose corn syrup, which is derived from corn starch, because of concerns it may be linked to obesity. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said it is unaware of any differences in the safety of foods containing equal amounts of corn syrup and sugar, or sucrose.  McDonald's is ""following the customers"" in switching to sucrose in buns used on Big Macs, Quarter Pounders, hamburgers and other sandwiches, said Marion Gross, senior vice president of McDonald's North America supply chain.""We know that they don't feel good about high-fructose corn syrup so we're giving them what they're looking for instead,"" she said.McDonald's stopped adding an artificial preservative to the cooking oil used to make Chicken McNuggets and removed artificial preservatives from pork sausage patties, eggs served on McGriddles breakfast sandwiches and scrambled eggs on breakfast platters. It also removed chicken skin, safflower oil and citric acid from the meat of its McNuggets, swapping them for pea starch, rice starch and powdered lemon juice.  Extra costs related to the changes will not be passed on to consumers, partly because a decline in commodity prices has reduced some food expenses, Andres said.Last week, McDonald's said the U.S. restaurant industry will raise prices far more than supermarkets this year, sending a chill through a sector that is searching for ways to protect itself from higher worker wages. McDonald's had previously planned to stop buying chicken raised with antibiotics important to human medicine from its suppliers, Tyson Foods Inc (TSN.N) and Keystone Foods, by March 2017. It completed the change earlier due to quicker than expected work by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which helped to verify that birds were not given the drugs, Gross said.Some health experts have raised concerns that the overuse of antibiotics for poultry may diminish their effectiveness in fighting disease in humans. McDonald's shares rose 0.3 percent to $118.01.

163,"   By Tom Polansek  Tyson Foods Inc (TSN.N) said profits should reach record highs this year and next as its focus on higher-margin packaged products pays off, after low feed and livestock costs helped quarterly earnings smash analysts' expectations on Monday.Shares of the biggest U.S. meat processor and the maker of Ball Park brand hot dogs reached an all-time high of $75.46 before easing in mid-afternoon trading. The company has cashed in as costs for livestock have fallen due to larger herd sizes and a decline in prices for grain used to feed the animals due to massive global inventories. It also has benefited by shifting its strategy toward selling prepared food items that command higher margins than commodity meats.""Tyson is firing on all cylinders right now, and with corn below $3.40/bushel, we think the lights will stay on at the party for some time,"" JP Morgan analyst Ken Goldman said in a note.Food companies, including Tyson and rival Hormel Foods Corp (HRL.N), must adapt their product lines as consumers are increasingly turning to fresher items and those perceived to be healthier and away from processed foods. Tyson said its retail sales volumes of fresh meat were growing, with consumers shopping more on the perimeter of grocery stores. It also said it may expand into organically raised chicken.""That is something we're squarely focused on as consumers are demanding products in that area,"" President Tom Hayes told reporters on a conference call.Perdue Farms, a privately held competitor to Tyson, has been selling organic chicken since 2011 and says it is the largest U.S. organic-certified chicken producer. Overall, supplies of chicken, beef and pork are expected to rise next year, which could pressure meat prices and processors' earnings. But Hayes said Tyson executives ""don't feel threatened"" by the outlook.""The consumer is coming toward these companies with their interest in protein,"" Stephens analyst Farha Aslam said.Tyson's operating margins in the third quarter ended on July 2 were a record 8.2 percent, up from 5.6 percent a year earlier, according to the company. Net income attributable to the company rose to $484 million, or $1.25 per share, in the quarter, from $343 million, or 83 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, the company earned $1.21 per share.

179,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 21 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Issuer Default  Ratings (IDRs) of Tyson Foods, Inc. (Tyson; NYSE: TSN) at 'BBB/F2' and the IDR  of its wholly-owned subsidiary - The Hillshire Brands Co. (Hillshire) - at  'BBB'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.  Tyson's ratings recognize structural improvement in the company's business and  significant debt reduction since the 2014 acquisition of Hillshire. However,  ratings incorporate Fitch's view that the current prolonged period of favorable  industry fundamentals is not sustainable and that operating margins and EBITDA  will revert to a more normalized level over the intermediate term.  Fitch expects operating margins to approximate 6% (translating to segment-level  operating margins at the low end of Tyson's current normalized ranges), and for  EBITDA to be around $3 billion in most years such that total adjusted  debt/EBITDA is sustained around 2.0x. This compares to an LTM EBITDA of $3.5  billion and operating margin of 7.3%. Fitch also anticipates Tyson will remain  acquisitive and that leverage could periodically spike above 2.0x to finance  potential transactions.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Significant Scale, Increased Diversification Tyson's ratings benefit from its significant scale, with LTM sales of $38.2  billion and EBITDA of $3.5 billion, leading position in U.S. protein, and  product diversification that includes a growing portfolio of branded packaged  food products. Tyson is one of the world's leading food companies with No. 1 and  No. 2 share in large and growing protein categories such as frozen breakfast and  smoked sausage under the Jimmy Dean and Hillshire brands.  Fitch believes Tyson is making progress towards its goal of transitioning from a  commodity meat and poultry processor to a protein-centric packaged foods  company. However, sales and earnings remain subject to periodic volatility  caused by changes in input costs and prices due to supply/demand dynamics of  commodity products.  Tyson's vulnerability to these risks is partially mitigated by diversification  in chicken, beef, pork, and prepared foods, operating efficiency, and a  conservative balance sheet. For the nine months ended July 2, 2016, segment  contribution to sales and operating earnings was as follows: chicken (28% and  48%), beef (39% and 9%), pork (13% and 19%), prepared foods (19% and 27%), and  other which consists mainly of foreign operations (1% and negative 3%).  Structural Changes, Prepared Volume Weakness Structural changes have enhanced Tyson's margins and are providing increased  earnings stability. Changes implemented over the past several years include  improved operating efficiency and closure of inefficient processing facilities.  Moreover, within the chicken segment specifically, Tyson has diversified its  pricing to include more short-term and fewer fixed-price customer contracts,  instituted a more disciplined risk management strategy, and uses a buy versus  grow strategy in chicken when appropriate.  Tyson has also increased its percentage of value-added and prepared food  products, particularly its 2014 $8.6 billion acquisition of Hillshire, which  offer higher margins and more stable cash flow than commodity proteins due to  less price volatility. Fitch estimates Tyson's sales dollar mix of value-added  and prepared foods to commodity proteins was about 40%/60% in fiscal 2015 and  views volume growth in prepared foods as a key rating driver. Value-added and branded packaged foods are susceptible to volume pressures as  consumer preferences change. Prepared foods volume rose 1.9% in the third  quarter ended July 2, 2016 but was down 2.1% in the nine-months ended July 2,  2016 due in part to Tyson reducing volume in lower margin categories at retail  and slower than planned price reduction reflected on retail shelves. Fitch views  1%-2% volume growth as achievable over the long term with continued innovation  and marketing support but anticipates that volumes will be negative in fiscal  2016. Momentum Continues, Modest Volatility Possible Longer-Term  Tyson's strong operating performance, which began in fiscal 2010, should  continue through fiscal 2017 due to the continuation of favorable industry  fundamentals related to low grain costs, ample livestock supply, and steady  global demand which partially offset the negative impact of increased industry  supply on selling prices. Results will also benefit from the realization of a  targeted $700 million of annual synergies related to the Hillshire acquisition  by the end of fiscal 2017 and continued operating efficiency. Synergies are  being sourced from operational improvements, manufacturing, procurement,  logistics, and organizational duplication and have exceeded $400 million since  August 2014 and should be sustainable over the long term. This year Tyson raised its normalized margin in chicken to 9%-11% from 7%-9%,  after increasing it from 5%-7% at the end of fiscal 2014. In 2015, the company  raised its prepared foods normalized margin to 10%-12% from 4%-6% due mainly to  the integration of Hillshire but lowered beef to 1.5%-3% from 2.5%-4.5%.  Normalized margin expectations for pork have been maintained at 6%-8% since  2010.  For the nine months ended July 2, 2016, each of Tyson's core segments performed  within or above their normalized range. As mentioned, Tyson's EBITDA for the LTM  period ended July 2, 2016 was $3.5 billion, reflecting in part abnormally strong  industry fundamentals driven by low grain costs, ample livestock supply, and  steady global demand. The company's consolidated operating margin was 7.3%.  Longer-term, Fitch views EBITDA of around $3 billion and an operating margin  around 6% as more reflective of a normalized level of profitability for Tyson.  Fitch also expects performance in chicken and prepared foods to drive future  growth, given they are Tyson's highest-margin segments. Disciplined Financial Strategy Tyson maintains a conservative financial strategy, targeting net debt-to EBITDA  of 1.5x-2.0x over time (which approximates gross debt to EBITDA in the  high-1x-low-2x range assuming cash of $200 million-$300 million). The company  also strives to maintain overall liquidity in the $1.2 billion-$1.5 billion  range. Fitch believes Tyson's conservative stance is due to potential operating  earnings volatility. For the LTM ended July 2, 2016, total debt-to-EBITDA was 1.8x, down from 4.3x at  the end of fiscal 2014 following the acquisition of Hillshire, and FCF was $1.8  billion. Cash flow is benefiting from favorable operating fundamentals and  significant synergy capture which has allowed Tyson to reduce debt by roughly $2  billion to $6.2 billion since the end of fiscal 2014.  Fitch expects leverage to approximate 2x over the forecast horizon. FCF is  projected to approximate $1 billion or more annually during this time period and  to be deployed mainly towards share repurchases, absent acquisitions.  Tyson remains open to strategic M&A, particularly of companies with value-added  and branded protein-related products, even though organic growth continues to be  an important driver of sales and operating earnings. The company has completed  tuck-in acquisitions to enhance its existing portfolio, is proving its ability  to integrate large purchases, and has demonstrated a willingness to utilize  equity to finance sizeable deals.  Fitch views debt capacity at the current rating level, based on a projected $3.5  billion of EBITDA in fiscal 2016 and total debt-to-EBITDA of no more than 2.5x,  as at least $2.5 billion depending on EBITDA contribution of any acquired  entity.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Tyson's fiscal years include: -Consolidated revenue declines about 10% in 2016 to about $37 billion due mainly  to lower sales prices and divestiture of non-core businesses; declines moderate  to the low single digits in 2017 as pressures on pricing, particularly in beef  ease, and then revenue grows at a low-single-digit rate in 2018; -Consolidated volumes are relatively flat, excluding the impact of divestitures,  in 2016, but vary among the segments; volumes increase at a low-single-digit  rate in 2017 and 2018; -Consolidated EBITDA of about $3.6 billion in 2016, $3.3 billion in 2017, and $3  billion in 2018 as fundamentals revert to a more normalized level and Fitch's  view of a normalized 6% EBIT margin; --FCF approximating $1 billion or more annually, the majority of which is  deployed towards share repurchases;  -Total debt-to-EBITDA of approximately 2x over the medium term.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive Triggers: Continued progress transitioning towards a protein-centric  packaged foods company as exhibited by reduced variability in operating earnings  and better than expected volume trends in prepared foods. The ability to sustain  normalized consolidated EBIT margins above the 6%-7% range while maintaining  total debt-to-EBITDA below 2x, and an FCF margin of 2.5% (more than $1 billion  annually) would be key indicators of continued progress.  Negative Triggers: A sustained period of total debt-to-EBITDA above 2.5x due to  sluggish earnings growth or a change in financial policy would result in a  negative rating action. Worsening industry fundamentals caused by meaningfully  higher feed costs or a prolonged protein supply/demand imbalance would be  leading indicators of a potential downturn in earnings. A sustained loss of  market share in branded packaged meats would be of concern.  LIQUIDITY Fitch views Tyson's liquidity as ample. Liquidity is supported by good FCF  generation, a $1.25 billion unsecured revolver that can be upsized by $500  million, and the maintenance of moderate cash balances. At July 2, 2016, Tyson  had $1.3 billion of liquidity consisting of $197 million of cash and $1.1  billion available under its revolver.  Tyson's revolver matures on Sept. 25, 2019. The facility subjects the firm to a  maximum debt-to-capitalization ratio of 60% and a minimum interest expense  coverage ratio of 3.75x for which the company has significant cushion. After  repaying its $638 million of 6.6% notes due April 2016, upcoming maturities  include $88 million of amortizing notes due July 2017 and $120 million of 7%  notes due May 2018. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Tyson Foods, Inc. (Parent) --Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB'; --Unsecured bank credit facilities at 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB'; --Short-Term IDR at 'F2'. The Hillshire Brands Co. --Long-Term IDR at 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

180,"   By Lisa Baertlein and Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Tyson Foods Inc shares tumbled more than 14 percent on Monday after the nation's biggest meat processor forecast lower-than-expected 2017 profit and said well-regarded Chief Executive Officer Donnie Smith would step down at the end of the year. Smith's departure surprised some on Wall Street, who regard him as the company's most successful CEO.The seller of Jimmy Dean sausage and Ball Park hot dogs  also reported disappointing quarterly results, citing increased investment spending, the double whammy of spiking chicken feed costs and lower demand, and a prepared foods production hiccup following the closure of a factory that makes pizza toppings.""We are not at all happy to see Mr. Smith step down,"" Pivotal Research Group analyst Timothy Ramey wrote in a client note. Shares of Tyson have more than quadrupled since Smith became CEO seven years ago.""It has been the best period of Tyson's history, without doubt,"" said Ramey, adding that it is unusual for a company to part with its best CEO. Smith is 56 years old.In another concern for investors, Tyson and other chicken processors face class-action lawsuits accusing them of price fixing. Tyson has been looking to expand profits by selling more ""value-added"" items such as pre-seasoned products and heat-and-serve meals, which command higher margins than basic meats. Tom Hayes, the company's president, will succeed Smith who has been at the helm since November 2009. Hayes, 51, was previously chief supply chain officer for Hillshire Brands Co, which Tyson bought in 2014.Tyson also decided to retain Smith as an adviser for three years, an unusually long period for such a transition. The company canceled a media call, making it harder to get a further explanation. Tyson expects profit of $4.70 to $4.85 a share in the year ending September 2017, below analysts' average estimate of $4.98. It said it would boost capital spending to $1 billion from $700 million in 2016 to increase production and improve worker safety, animal welfare, food safety and its supply chain.  ""The board's decision to name Tom (Hayes) CEO at this time was based on both his track record and how his skills align with the company's strategic direction and continuing evolution,"" John Tyson, chairman of the board and the founder's grandson, said in a statement. Smith said it was an excellent time for a CEO change and that the ongoing price-fixing litigation had no bearing on his departure.""That has nothing to do with the transition,"" Smith said. Tyson said sales fell 12.8 percent from a year earlier to $9.16 billion in the fourth quarter ended Oct. 1. Tyson cited sharply lower beef prices and lower prices for value-added chicken products.Analysts, on average, had expected revenue of $9.38 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Excluding items, the company earned 96 cents a share, missing analysts' average estimate of $1.17 per share. Net income attributable to Tyson surged 51.6 percent to $391 million, or $1.03 per share, helped by lower feed and livestock costs.Shares were down 14.6 percent to $57.56 in afternoon trading. As of Friday's close, Tyson stock had surged 26.3 percent this year.

189,"   By Tom Polansek | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Tyson Foods Inc (TSN.N) has launched a $150 million venture capital fund that will target investments in companies commercializing meat substitutes, deepening the largest U.S. chicken producer's foray into alternative sources of protein.The fund also will invest in companies that aim to make money by reducing food waste and those that develop technology products related to food and agriculture, the company said on Monday.Tyson's interest in supporting substitutes to the chicken, beef and pork at the core of its business comes after the company took a 5 percent stake in plant-based protein maker Beyond Meat in October.Meat faces pressure from diners who may be concerned about animal welfare and the environmental impact of raising animals, or view vegetarian meals as healthier.""Where the consumer is headed is in a space of growth and demand for all forms of protein, with plant-based and alterative proteins being one of those areas of interest,"" said Monica McGurk, Tyson's president for food service. Tyson has been working on the fund for months and outgoing Chief Executive Donnie Smith has supported it, said McGurk, who is also executive vice president of strategy and new ventures. Last month, the company said Smith would step down at the end of the year and be replaced by the president, who was previously chief supply chain officer for Hillshire Brands Co, which Tyson bought in 2014.  Tyson has increasingly been focusing on higher-margin packaged products, such as prepared foods, and McGurk said the new fund was ""about broadening our exposure to innovative, new forms of protein and ways of producing food.""         In regulatory filings, the company warns investors that demand for alternative proteins could throw off its financial performance.        Global sales of meat substitutes jumped to an estimated $4 billion this year, a 42 percent rise since 2010, according to research firm Markets and Markets. That remains tiny compared with sales of real meat. Relatively few startup companies are making alternative forms of protein, according to AgFunder, an online food and agriculture investment platform. During the first half of 2016, they raised just $88 million, it said in a study in August.Large food and agriculture companies are increasingly using venture funds to invest in such startups, AgFunder CEO Rob Leclerc said.""It's a bit of a hedge for them and gives the company an ability to get close to that culture that they lack,"" he said.
