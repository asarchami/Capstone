Looking forward, Whirlpool said it expects to report full-year earnings excluding special items in a range of $12.00 to $12.50 a share.Going into Thursday's report, analysts were expecting the company to report full-year earnings excluding special items of $12.26 a share, according to Thomson Reuters estimates.",2014-01-30,WHR,"Thu Jan 30, 2014 | 6:46am EST",UPDATE 1-Strong Americas sales drive Whirlpool profit up 48 pct,http://www.reuters.com//article/whirlpool-results-idUSL2N0L40H920140130?type=companyNews

2,"  NEW YORK Manufacturing grew at a substantially slower pace in January as new order growth plunged by the most in 33 years, driving overall factory activity to an eight-month low, an industry report showed on Monday.The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity fell to 51.3 last month, to its lowest level since May 2013, from a recently revised 56.5 in December.January's figure was also well below the median forecast of 56 in a Reuters poll of economists, missing even the lowest estimate of 54.2. Readings above 50 indicate expansion. The January reading marked a second straight month of slowing growth from November's recent peak reading of 57, which had been the highest since April 2011, suggesting the economy may be losing some of the momentum it had enjoyed in the second half of 2013.The biggest red flag in the ISM report was the huge drop in the forward-looking new orders index, which fell to 51.2 from 64.4 in December. That 13.2-point drop was the largest monthly decline in that key component since December 1980. Indicators of employment, production and inventory growth also declined from December. At 52.3, the employment reading was the weakest since June and well below December's 18-month high of 55.8. Meanwhile, the prices index surged to 60.5 from 53.5, the highest reading since last February.(Reporting By Dan Burns; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli)",2014-02-03,WHR,"Mon Feb 3, 2014 | 10:45am EST",Manufacturing growth slows in January as new orders plunge: ISM,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-economy-manufacturing-idUSBREA120X720140203?type=companyNews
3,"  * Sears, Whirlpool were sued over moldy washers* U.S. Supreme Court lets consumers pursue class actionsBy Lawrence Hurley and Jonathan StempelWASHINGTON/NEW YORK, Feb 24 The U.S. Supreme Court gave consumers a victory on Monday by allowing them to proceed with class-action lawsuits alleging that millions of front-loading washing machines they bought suffered from mold or musty odors.By refusing to hear the appeals in three lawsuits, the court allowed claims against Whirlpool Corp, Sears Holdings Corp and a unit of Germany's BSH Bosch und Siemens Hausgeraete GmbH to move forward as class actions in lower courts.Business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers had urged the Supreme Court to hear the companies' appeals.The court has in recent years cut back on the ability of plaintiffs to pursue class actions, which can lead to bigger jury awards and settlements than individual lawsuits, in cases against AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.At issue in the washing-machine cases was whether claims about alleged defects in Whirlpool washers, Kenmore-brand washers made for Sears by Whirlpool, and BSH Home Appliance Corp washers were similar enough to be heard at the same time. Consumers said that the machines did not clean themselves properly, while the companies said only a small number of machines had problems.Whirlpool said in a statement that it would keep vigorously defending against the lawsuits, which it called an ""attack"" on American manufacturing.""The facts remain unchanged: the vast majority of class members have not been harmed and never will be,"" it said.Sears  said in a statement that it disagreed with the decision and that an ""overwhelming majority"" of owners of its Kenmore front-loading washers were pleased with them. BSH declined to comment.Samuel Issacharoff, a New York University law professor who represents Sears and Whirlpool consumers, called the court's decision ""a big win,"" adding: ""There is nothing un-American about manufacturers having to stand behind their products.""OPENING THE DOOR  The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati and the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago had allowed consumers to pursue respective claims as groups against Whirlpool in Ohio, and Sears in six U.S. states.Those courts' initial rulings for the consumers were later thrown out after the Supreme Court ruled for Comcast last March over cable TV subscribers who accused it of overcharging them. The court said the proposed Comcast class was too diverse.The 6th Circuit and 7th Circuit nonetheless later ruled for the washing-machine plaintiffs a second time.Sears had said the 7th Circuit decision by Judge Richard Posner ""opens the door to class actions based on any mass-produced product's failure to meet expectations of a handful of consumers, no matter how few other buyers had the same problem.""Another appeals court, the 9th Circuit, had refused to let BSH appeal a December 2012 ruling by a federal judge in Santa Ana, California, allowing a class action against that company to go ahead.Whirlpool is based in Benton Harbor, Michigan; Sears in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, and BSH Bosch in Munich.The cases are BSH Home Appliances Corp v. Cobb et al, 13-138; Sears, Roebuck & Co v. Butler et al, 13-430, and Whirlpool Corp v.

4,"  WASHINGTON Feb 24 The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to take up a closely watched legal battle concerning consumer claims against manufacturers and retailers of front-loading washing machines.By declining to hear the cases, the court allowed claims against Sears Roebuck and Co, Whirlpool Corp and BSH Home Appliance Corp to move forward in lower courts.  The lawsuits claimed Kenmore-brand high-efficiency washers, manufactured for the Sears Holding Co subsidiary by Whirlpool, Whirlpool's own-brand washers, and those manufactured by BSH, a subsidiary of Germany-based BSH Bosch und Siemens Hausgerate GMbH, were defective in part because they emitted unpleasant odors.

6,"  (Adds comments from CEO interview, details on U.S. weather impact, updates share movement)By James B. KelleherApril 25 Whirlpool Corp on Friday reported first-quarter earnings below analysts' expectations as currency and other headwinds in Latin America and Asia offset modest sales increases in North America and Europe.The world's largest maker of home appliances also said brutal winter weather in the United States not only kept consumers out showrooms but disrupted shipments from its factories in the Midwest, costing it between $10 million and $20 million.The news sent the company's shares down as much as 3.6 percent on the New York Stock Exchange, although the stock had almost recovered by the afternoon.Chief Executive Officer Jeff Fettig told Reuters he remained ""very bullish on the U.S. recovery"" despite a slew of disappointing reports in recent weeks on new home sales, housing starts and building permits.The new-housing and resale markets account for 25 percent to 30 percent of U.S. home appliance demand, according to Whirlpool.Fettig said that while the company's U.S. sales had suffered in January and February because of the weather, they snapped back in March and continued to rebound in April.Whirlpool reported a first-quarter net profit of $160 million, or $2.02 per share, down from $252 million, or $3.12 a share, a year earlier. Excluding a tax credit last year and restructuring costs this year, Whirlpool said earnings rose to $2.20 a share from $1.97.But even by that measure, the results were disappointing.     Analysts on average had expected the Benton Harbor, Michigan-based company to report a profit of $2.33 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.SALES CHALLENGES  ""Sales in Asia were on the underwhelming side, mirroring the data that has been piling up from the region,"" said Brian Sozzi, chief executive officer of Belus Capital Advisors.Results from North America, while positive, were a ""rude awakening,"" Sozzi said, since the U.S. housing market's stuttering recovery would force Whirlpool to spend more on marketing to meet its sales goals.Earlier this week, the U.S. Commerce Department said sales of new U.S. single-family homes tumbled to an eight-month low in March, raising concerns about the strength of the housing recovery and increasing the uncertainty for Whirlpool in its home market.The company, which sells its washers and dryers, stoves, and refrigerators under brand names including Whirlpool, Maytag, KitchenAid and Jenn-Air, said sales rose 4.7 percent to $4.4 billion, slightly higher than the $4.3 billion analysts had expected. Whirlpool said sales rose 4 percent in North America and by a similar rate in Europe.Sales increased in Latin America and Asia, too, but higher material costs and currency swings hurt profitability in those regions, Whirlpool said.The company said it expected full-year industry unit shipments to be up 5 percent to 7 percent in North America, flat to up 2 percent in Europe, flat in South America and flat to up 3 percent in Asia.Fettig acknowledged sales to China had declined in the first quarter, something ""we've not seen for a while.""But he expressed confidence that the apparent slowdown was nothing to worry about because the Chinese economy is still expected to grow at twice the rate of most other big markets.""There is a transition going on,"" Fettig said. ""But I don't think it's an unhealthy transition, and we're still making big investments there.""Whirlpool said it still expected to report full-year net income of $11.05 to $11.55 a share and a profit of $12.00 to $12.50, excluding items.In afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading, Whirlpool shares were down less than 0.1 percent at $154.57 after falling as low as $149.10.

9,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO, July 7  SAN FRANCISCO, July 7 Samsung Electronics , Intel Corp and Dell have joined to establish standard ways for household gadgets like thermostats and light bulbs to talk to each other, at odds with a framework backed by Qualcomm, LG Electronics and other companies.The new Open Interconnect Consortium, like the Qualcomm-supported AllSeen Alliance, aims to establish how smart devices work together in a trend increasingly called the Internet of Things.Manufacturers are rolling out growing numbers of Internet-connected burglar alarms, televisions and light switches. But like the early days of video cassette recorders, current smart home products are often incompatible with each other.The new consortium, which also includes chipmakers Broadcom  and Atmel, was announced in a news release late on Monday. Doug Fisher, general manager of Intel's Software and Services Group, told Reuters that the framework to be developed by the new consortium would address security and other issues not adequately handled by the AllSeen group.The potential emergence of smart household products made by manufacturers using two sets of incompatible standards would be incidental, he said.""We're not out to create that. We just think the industry has spoken and there's this approach that's needed,"" Fisher said. ""We're certainly welcoming others to participate."" Last week, Microsoft became the 51st member of the AllSeen Alliance, which also includes Sharp Corp and other consumer electronics manufacturers.Rob Chandhok, senior vice president of Qualcomm Technologies Inc, compared the two competing standards groups to walled-off online services in the early 1990s before widespread Internet use. ""It's better for us to have an industry-wide shared platform than to be divided,"" Chandhok said. ""I don't want to get to a 'Prodigy and CompuServe' of the Internet of Things.""Technology heavyweights Apple and Google are also pursuing their own ways of interconnecting household devices.Apple, known for strictly controlling how other companies' products interact with its own, in June announced HomeKit, which will integrate control of devices like lights and thermostats.Google's Nest has also partnered with companies including Whirlpool Corp and light bulb maker LIFX to integrate their products with its thermostats and smoke detectors.

Indesit has eight industrial sites (in Italy,  Poland, the United Kingdom, Russia and Turkey) and approximately 16,000  employees.During fiscal 2013, Indesit had sales of EUR2.67 billion and EBITDA of  approximately EUR178.5 million.  The company generated about 56% of revenues  from Western Europe, 38% from Eastern Europe and 6% from non-European markets.  The proposed acquisition has good strategic rationale for Whirlpool.  Indesit  provides Whirlpool with a broader platform to expand its operations in Europe.Currently, about 16% of Whirlpool's revenues are generated from this region.  On  a pro forma basis (including Indesit), sales from Europe, Middle East and Africa  will represent about 29% of Whirlpool's worldwide sales.Appliance demand in Europe remains relatively weak.  Whirlpool's sales in the  EMEA region grew 8% during the first quarter of 2014 (1Q'14) compared with 1Q'13  but the 1Q'14 sales are still 13% below the 1Q'07 sales level.  Indesit's  revenues for the 1Q'14 were 6.6% lower compared with 1Q'13 sales, due to lower  volumes and the negative effect of foreign currency translation.  Fitch  currently expects appliance sales in Europe will be flat to slightly higher in  2014 compared with 2013. IMPACT ON RATINGS While Fitch views the transaction as strategically positive for Whirlpool,  negative rating actions are likely given the projected increase in leverage from  higher debt levels (debt to be assumed and the debt incurred to finance the  acquisition).  In June 2014, Fitch affirmed Whirlpool's Issuer Default Rating  (IDR) at 'BBB' and revised the Outlook to Positive from Stable with the  expectation that the company's credit metrics continued to improve, including  debt to EBITDA situating in the 1x-1.5x and interest coverage consistently above  10x. An upgrade of Whirlpool's ratings is now unlikely.Fitch now estimates that the company's debt to EBITDA could be in excess of 2.0x  and funds from operations (FFO) adjusted leverage could be 3.5x or higher by  year-end 2015, depending on the amount of the acquisition price that will be  funded by debt.Whirlpool's IDR could be downgraded one-notch to 'BBB-'.  Conversely, the  company's ratings could also be affirmed at the current level should Whirlpool's  credit metrics stay within the parameters of the 'BBB' rating level, including  debt to EBITDA sustained in the 1.5x-2.0x range and interest coverage between  6.0x-10.0x.Fitch will meet with management in the next month to review the transaction,  including management's strategy to integrate the operations and Whirlpool's  capital structure following the completion of the acquisition.  Fitch expects to  resolve the Rating Watch Negative upon the closing of the transaction and review  of Whirlpool's financial and credit profile.Fitch has placed the following ratings on Watch Negative: Whirlpool Corporation--Long-term IDR at 'BBB';--Short-term IDR at 'F2';--Commercial paper at 'F2';--Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB';--Bank revolving credit facility at 'BBB' (Whirlpool Corp., Whirlpool Europe  B.V., Whirlpool Finance B.V. and Whirlpool Canada Holding Company as borrowers). Maytag Corporation--Long-term IDR at 'BBB';--Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB'.Whirlpool Finance B.V.--Short-term IDR at 'F2';--Commercial paper (CP) at 'F2'.",2014-07-14,WHR,"Mon Jul 14, 2014 | 9:16am EDT",RPT-Fitch Places Whirlpool's Ratings on Watch Negative,http://www.reuters.com//article/fitch-places-whirlpools-ratings-on-watch-idUSFit70895820140714?type=companyNews
16,"   By James B. Kelleher  Whirlpool Corp on Wednesday posted a lower-than-expected quarterly profit and cut its full-year earnings outlook, citing a sales drop triggered by its pending acquisition of a Chinese rival.The U.S. appliance maker said its sales in China plummeted 80 percent last quarter as retailers in that country, anticipating its pending merger with Hefei Rongshida Sanyo Electric Co and the new line the merged entity will produce, stopped buying Whirlpool-branded products.""Trade partners are liquidating their old inventory and getting ready for the new inventory, which will come from the combined company,"" Whirlpool CEO Jeff Fettig told Reuters in an interview. Whirlpool and Hefei Sanyo can't officially merge until Chinese regulators sign off on the deal -- a process that Fettig said is taking longer than anyone expected and may drag on through the end of 2014.""In the meantime we're ratcheting down our fixed costs as fast as we can and we're preparing for the integration and waiting for the approval,"" he said. ""And when we get it, and we merge ... this will all be behind us and we should see the flip side of this, which will be good sales because they will not have bought from us for months.""Whirlpool's fixed costs in China are tied up in two plants, one in ChangXing and another in Shunde. Whirlpool said it now expected to report full-year net earnings of $10.30 to $10.80 a share, down from a previous forecast range of $11.50 to $12.00.S&P Capital IQ equity analyst Efraim Levy said that while Whirlpool's China business isn't huge -- the company generated just $200 million of its $18.8 billion in global sales there last year -- it has significant fixed costs in the country. As a result, the temporary drop in Chinese sales ""just destroys margins.” Hefei Sanyo's Chinese sales were about $850 million last year, Fettig said. Whirlpool said the outlook cut also reflected investment banking, legal and accounting costs associated with its pending acquisition of a majority stake in Italian rival Indesit.The news came as Whirlpool, the world's largest maker of home appliances, reported disappointing earnings.

Whirlpool, which sells its washers and dryers, stoves, and refrigerators under its own name as well as brands including Maytag, KitchenAid and Jenn-Air, said it had sold $4.7 billion in goods during the quarter, unchanged from a year earlier.It said that sales gains in North America were offset by weakness in the rest of the world, including Latin America, Europe and Asia.In early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Whirlpool shares were up 51 cents, or 0.3 percent, at $143.71.

19,"   By Lucia Mutikani | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. services sector activity hit an 8-1/2 year high last month and factory orders surged in June, bolstering expectations of solid economic growth in the third quarter.Tuesday's reports added to employment and consumer spending data in suggesting sustained momentum in the economy that could bring the Federal Reserve closer to raising interest rates.    ""The economy is normal, and a normal economy requires a normal interest rate, not a zero interest rate,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. The Institute for Supply Management's services index rose to 58.7 last month, the highest level since December 2005, from 56.0 in June. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. Activity in the sector, which accounts for more than 80 percent of the U.S. economy, was boosted by a jump in orders, which touched their highest point in nearly nine years. A sub-index gauging services industry employment also rose as did order backlogs, but export order growth moderated.  In a separate report, the Commerce Department said orders for manufactured goods increased 1.1 percent in June, more than reversing May's 0.6 percent decline. Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - a measure of business confidence and spending plans - hit a record high.  Strong business investment is one of the key ingredients needed for robust economic growth and the surge will be welcomed by Fed officials as they weigh the course of monetary policy.Interest rate futures now point to a better-then-even chance the U.S. central bank will hike overnight rates in June of next year.

21,"  SAN FRANCISCO Aug 14 Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  will buy SmartThings, a  startup backed by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin that helps connect household devices, one of its largest U.S.-startup acquisitions to date.The South Korean electronics maker joins fellow technology heavyweights Apple Inc and Google Inc in exploring ways to integrate connected household gadgets such as thermostats and lights with mobile apps, a trend commonly known as ""Internet of Things.""Samsung did not disclose financials. But the TechCrunch blog reported in July that Samsung was in discussions to pay more than $200 million for the two-year-old startup of 55 employees, which has raised $15.5 million in venture capital from Greylock and Russian investor Yuri Milner, among others.SmartThings, which lets people use a mobile app to control connected devices, says it has some 5,000 developers building devices that connect to its open platform. It will continue to operate independently but move its base from Washington, D.C. to Palo Alto, California. Some tech and telecommunications executives view the market for ""smart,"" or connected, home devices as poised to explode.Manufacturers are rolling out Internet-connected burglar alarms, televisions and light switches. But like the early days of video cassette recorders, current smart home products are often incompatible with each other. The largest tech players are now drawing up alliances to  create common standards for the next generation of gadgets.Apple, known for strictly controlling how other companies' products interact with its own, in June announced HomeKit, which it describes as a framework to communicate with devices in the home. Google's Nest has also partnered with companies including Whirlpool Corp and light bulb maker LIFX to integrate their products with its thermostats and smoke detectors.Samsung, which already makes Internet-connected appliances such as refrigerators and washing machines, has allied with Intel Corp and Dell Inc, among others. Qualcomm Inc  has forged a rival alliance with Microsoft Corp .SmartThings, which is owned by the Physical Graph Corp, began life as a crowdfunded Kickstarter project in 2012.

22,"  * Deal will double U.S. sales* Values unit at 7.0-7.3 X 2014 EBITDA, ex synergies of $300 mln* Electrolux to issue shares after deal completed* Electrolux shares close up 5 pct   (Adds comment from U.S. antitrust expert, paragraphs 8-9; updates stock prices, paragraph 17; adds Breakingivews link)By Simon Johnson and Sven NordenstamSTOCKHOLM, Sept 8 Sweden's Electrolux AB  said on Monday it would double U.S. sales by paying $3.3 billion in cash for General Electric Co's appliances business in its biggest ever deal, giving it the scale to go head-to-head with larger rival Whirlpool.GE's century-old household appliance business, which had $5.7 billion in 2013 revenue, could help the Swedish company expand beyond its core European market, where growth has trailed that in North America.Electrolux, the world's second-largest appliance maker by sales, will see its annual sales in North America more than double to over $10 billion, similar in size to Whirlpool's sales there. It also gets to keep the iconic GE Appliance brands.The GE unit sells refrigerators, stoves, air conditioners and water heaters under the GE Monogram, GE Cafe and Hotpoint brands.""I think it's a historic event for Electrolux. I'm very excited about it. I think the fit - the strategic fit, the industrial logic - is compelling,"" Electrolux Chief Executive Keith McLoughlin told Reuters.While the price tag is higher than the $2 billion to $2.5 billion figure that some people familiar with the business had estimated, analysts said the company was not overpaying. The deal includes GE's 48.4 percent stake in Mexican appliance maker Mabe.Reuters reported last week that Electrolux was near a deal to buy the GE business for more than $2.5 billion. The deal is likely to clear antitrust hurdles in the United States, with some asset sales possible to ensure that it complies with antitrust law, according to three experts.""The ultimate question is whether it (the proposed deal) will affect the cost of refrigerators. I suspect the answer is no,"" said Evan Stewart of the law firm Cohen & Gresser LLP.Electrolux said the price was 7.0-7.3 times GE Appliance's estimated 2014 earnings before tax, interest, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), based on an enterprise value, including debt, of $3.45 billion, according to ThomsonReuters data.Including expected annual cost savings of around $300 million, the multiple paid for GE would be much lower at around five times EBITDA, Electrolux Chief Financial Officer Tomas Eliasson told a conference call.""If they manage to realize the synergies, it's clearly a good multiple,"" said Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Johan Eliason, adding that the inclusion of the Mabe stake would strengthen Electrolux's position in Latin America on top of the clout it is gaining in North America.""They're getting access to both North and South America in a very good way, and will become very strong in all of the Americas,"" Eliason said. The deal will be financed by a bridge facility, and the company plans a rights issue to raise about 25 percent of the price after the deal's expected closing next year, Electrolux said.Investor, the investment company founded by Sweden's Wallenberg family and owner of 15.5 percent of Electrolux's capital, gave the deal and the right issue its stamp of approval.""As the leading owner, with a long-term ownership horizon, we find Electrolux's acquisition of GE Appliances industrially attractive and fully support it,"" Investor Chief Executive Börje Ekholm said. ELECTROLUX SHARES RISE Electrolux shares closed up 9.6 crowns, or 5 percent, at 197.10 crowns, outperforming the wider Stockholm market . GE shares finished down 2 cents, or .08 percent, at $26.08 per share on the New York Stock Exchange.General Electric put the profitable but low-margin  appliance business up for sale in 2008, but talks fizzled out as the global recession took hold. The unit is almost exclusively focused on the U.S. market and has lacked global scale.GE said last month that it was evaluating strategic options for the home appliance business, including discussions with Electrolux.""There will always be small non-core disposals over time, Appliances is likely the largest industrial exit we will see for some time,"" said Morgan Stanley analyst Nigel Coe in a research note.Last year, GE Appliances had sales of $5.7 billion, 90 percent of which were in North America, with EBITDA of $390 million, including the share of profit from Mabe.Electrolux, which sells under brands such as Frigidaire, AEG and Zanussi as well as its own name, is the world's second-largest home appliance maker after Whirlpool, but has its strongest market position in Europe.In 2013, western Europe accounted for 28 percent of group sales while North America represented 32 percent. Organic growth in North America was 7 percent while in Europe it was 0.4 percent.Rival Whirlpool had revenues of $18.8 billion in 2013 against $22.5 billion for a combined Electrolux and GE Appliances.Whirlpool has also been on the acquisition path, buying a 60 percent stake in Italian firm Indesit, which had revenues of 2.7 billion euros ($3.49 billion) in 2013. It has also agreed to buy Hefei Rongshida Sanyo Electric Co   which had 2013 revenues of around $850 million.Deutsche Bank and SEB Corporate Finance were Electrolux's financial advisers on the deal, while Davis Polk & Wardwell was lead legal advisor.

27,"   By Jason Lange | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Growth in U.S. factory activity slowed more than expected in September even as hiring in the private sector accelerated, signs of an uneven expansion in the U.S. economy.The Institute for Supply Management said on Wednesday its index of national factory activity dropped to 56.6 last month, its lowest level since June, from 59.0 in August. Economists had forecast it would slide to just 58.5.A gauge of new orders fell to 60.0 from 66.7.Analysts have warned that U.S. factories could feel a chill from soft demand in the global economy and from recent strength in the dollar, and the ISM data could be a harbinger.Still, gauges of U.S. manufacturing activity remain historically strong, with the ISM index still comfortably above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction - a sign the economy is still moving forward with strength.Analysts believe U.S. gross domestic product is growing much more quickly than its 2.2 percent average over the last two years, and the data did little to knock that view. ""It still looks as though overall GDP growth in the third quarter was around 3.5 percent,"" said Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Economics in London.U.S. Treasury yields fell as data from the United States, Europe and Asia all showed factory activity faltering, while stocks extended losses and the dollar slipped.The slowdown in U.S. factory growth followed an August reading that was the strongest since March 2011, leading some analysts to downplay the significance. ""Whether this month is a turning point is still to be seen,"" said Pierre Ellis, an economist at Decision Economics in New York.There were some signs of cooling in the auto sector last month. U.S. auto sales in the third quarter were the best in eight years, but mixed September results from leading automakers indicated the industry's torrid summer pace is slowing.  A report from major payrolls processor ADP showed U.S. private employers added 213,000 jobs in September, just above economists' expectations. ""Job gains remain strong and steady,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, which co-developed the report.The ADP figures come ahead of the government's more comprehensive payrolls report due on Friday, which includes both public and private-sector employment. That report is expected to show the economy added 215,000 jobs last month. A third report on Wednesday showed U.S. construction spending unexpectedly fell in August, hit by weaker private spending outside the housing sector and a pullback in public investments.The decline led forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers to trim its estimate of third-quarter GDP growth by three-tenths of a percentage point to a 3.0 percent annual pace. ""Homebuilding activity has shown decent growth in recent months, but business and government construction have turned lower,"" Morgan Stanley economist Ted Wieseman said in a research note.

34,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 22 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Whirlpool Corporation's  (NYSE: WHR) ratings, including the company's Issuer Default Rating (IDR), at  'BBB'.  The Rating Outlook is Stable.    Fitch placed Whirlpool's ratings on Rating Watch Negative in July 2014 following  the company's announcement that it has entered into binding agreements to  acquire a majority interest in Indesit Company S.p.A. (Indesit) for  approximately EUR758 million or $957 million (based on the exchange rate as of  Sept. 30, 2014).   ACQUISITION AGREEMENT In July 2014, Whirlpool entered into the following binding agreements: --Share repurchase agreement to acquire Fineldo S.p.A.'s stake in Indesit,  representing about 42.7% ownership; --Share repurchase agreement with certain members of the Merloni family for a  13.2% stake in Indesit; --Share repurchase agreement with Ms. Claudia Merloni for a 4.4% stake in  Indesit. On July 17, 2014, Whirlpool completed the purchase of 4.4% of Indesit shares  from Ms. Claudia Merloni.  On Oct. 14, 2014, Whirlpool completed the acquisition  of 42.7% of Indesit shares held by Fineldo S.p.A. and 13.2% of Indesit shares  held by certain members of the Merloni family. The company now has 60.4% ownership of Indesit, representing a 66.8% voting  stock in the company (including the treasury shares held by Indesit). Whirlpool will now commence the steps to launch a mandatory tender offer for the  remainder of Indesit's outstanding shares, with the intention to delist the  company.  The tender offer purchase price per share is equal to about $13.89 per  share (based on the exchange rate as of Sept. 30, 2014).  The company expects to  complete the tender offer no later than the first quarter of 2015. INDESIT ACQUISITION AND RATIONALE Founded in 1930, Indesit is one of the leading European manufacturers and  distributors of major appliances.  Indesit has eight industrial sites (in Italy,  Poland, the United Kingdom, Russia and Turkey) and approximately 16,000  employees. During fiscal 2013, Indesit had sales of EUR2.67 billion and EBITDA of  approximately EUR178.5 million.  The company generated about 56% of revenues  from Western Europe, 38% from Eastern Europe and 6% from non-European markets.  The proposed acquisition has good strategic rationale for Whirlpool.  Indesit  provides Whirlpool with a broader platform to expand its operations in Europe.   Currently, about 16% of Whirlpool's revenues are generated from this region.  On  a pro forma basis (including Indesit), sales from Europe, Middle East and Africa  will represent about 29% of Whirlpool's worldwide sales.  Appliance demand in Europe remains relatively weak.  Whirlpool's sales in the  EMEA region grew 4.8% during the first half of 2014 (1H'14) compared with 1H'13  but the 1H'14 sales are still 15.2% below the 1H'07 sales level.  Indesit's  revenues for the 1H'14 were 5.1% lower compared with 1H'13 sales, due to lower  volumes and the negative effect of foreign currency translation, offset in part  by positive price/mix.  Fitch currently expects appliance sales in Europe will  be flat to slightly higher in 2014 compared with 2013. IMPACT ON RATINGS While Fitch views the transaction as strategically positive for Whirlpool, the  acquisition will meaningfully increase the company's debt and leverage levels.   At the same time, Whirlpool also expects to close the acquisition of a 51%  equity stake in Hefei Rongshida Sanyo Electric Co., Ltd. (Hefei) for an  aggregate purchase price of RMB3.4 billion (approximately $547 million as of  June 30, 2014).   In June 2014 (prior to the announcement of the Indesit acquisition), Fitch  affirmed Whirlpool's IDR at 'BBB' and revised the Outlook to Positive from  Stable with the expectation that the company's credit metrics continue to  improve, including debt to EBITDA situating in the 1.0x-1.5x range and interest  coverage consistently above 10x. An upgrade of Whirlpool's ratings to 'BBB+' in  the next 12 months is now unlikely. The rating affirmation and Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that debt  to EBITDA will settle at around 1.5x - 2.0x and interest coverage will be above  9.0x within 12-24 months following the completion of the acquisitions of Indesit  and Hefei. Fitch now estimates that the company's debt to EBITDA will approximate 2.0x and  funds from operations (FFO) adjusted leverage will be 3.5x by year-end 2015.  Interest coverage is projected to be approximately 10.0x at the conclusion of  2015. Fitch expects the company will reduce leverage in 2016, with debt to EBITDA  projected to be about 1.5x, FFO adjusted leverage situating at 3.0x and interest  coverage above 10.0x at the end of 2016.  RATING SENSITIVITIES While Fitch does not expect a global economic downturn during the next 12  months, the company's risk profile is somewhat heightened by the significant  debt incurred for the acquisition of Indesit as well as the pending acquisition  of a 51% equity stake in Hefei.  Negative rating actions may be considered if  there is significant deterioration in global demand and consequently the  company's operating performance, Whirlpool undertakes shareholder friendly  activities funded by debt, and/or there is material judgment against the company  related to existing regulatory proceedings, leading to leverage levels  consistently exceeding 2.5x and interest coverage falling below 5.5x.  While unlikely in the next 12 months, positive rating actions may be considered  if the company's financial performance is meaningfully better than Fitch's base  case forecast, particularly debt-to-EBITDA consistently situating within a range  of 1.0x - 1.5x and interest coverage sustaining above 10x, as Whirlpool  continues to maintain a solid liquidity position. Fitch has affirms the following ratings with a Stable Outlook: Whirlpool Corporation --Long-term IDR at 'BBB'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial paper at 'F2'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB'; --Bank revolving credit facility at 'BBB'. Maytag Corporation --Long-term IDR at 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB'. Whirlpool Finance B.V.  --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial paper (CP) at 'F2'.

38,"   By Jessica Dye | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Whirlpool Corp was found not liable Thursday by a U.S. jury in the first lawsuit to go to trial accusing the company of selling front-loading washing machines containing a design flaw that made them prone to developing mold.  The jury cleared Whirlpool following a three-week trial in federal court in Ohio, according to lawyers for approximately 150,000 residents in that state who were part of the class action against the company. The class plaintiffs were all Ohio residents who had purchased one of 20 models of front-loading Whirlpool Duet washing machines between 2001 and 2009. They said in their lawsuit that a defect in the machines caused residue to accumulate, leading to mold and musty odors. The plaintiffs said they were not warned about the problem until after they had purchased the machines and were forced to undertake costly and time-consuming measures to remedy them. Benton Harbor, Michigan-based Whirlpool has denied that it is liable, and said in court filings that more than 95 percent of customers who had purchased one of the machines had never complained about a mold or odor problem.   In a statement, Eric Sharon, a litigation counsel at Whirlpool, called it a major victory for the company. “While other companies might have opted to settle this case out of court, Whirlpool firmly believed in the rule of law and that the facts were in our corner.”A lawyer for the plaintiffs, Jonathan Selbin, said he was disappointed with the verdict and intends to appeal. He noted in an email to Reuters that it was the first of what would likely be dozens of trials over the machines.  “Until Whirlpool takes responsibility for selling defective washers, the fight will continue,” he said. The company had fought fiercely against a court order that allowed the Ohio consumers to sue as a group, rather than pursue their claims individually. Whirlpool argued that since many of the customers did not actually suffer any harm and had purchased a range of different machines, they did not have enough in common to sue as a group.  The company appealed the class certification decision to the U.S. Supreme Court twice. Although the high court originally vacated the decision and sent it back to a lower appeals court for further consideration, the appeals court upheld class certification once again and the Supreme Court denied further review.  The Ohio suit is among 11 that have been consolidated in the Ohio federal court, according to court statistics, and there are additional lawsuits filed in other states. The case is Glazer v. Whirlpool, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, No. 08-65000.

40,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 30 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB' rating to  Whirlpool Corporation's (NYSE: WHR) proposed offering of $650 million aggregate  amount of senior unsecured notes. The new offering will be equal in right of  payment with all other senior unsecured debt. Whirlpool intends to use the proceeds from the notes offering to repay  commercial paper borrowings, which replaced amounts borrowed under its long-term  revolving credit facility to fund the purchase of shares of Indesit Company  S.p.A. (Indesit). INDESIT AND HEFEI ACQUISITIONS On Oct. 14, 2014, Whirlpool completed the acquisition of majority ownership of  Indesit. The company now has 60.4% ownership of Indesit, representing a 66.8%  voting stock in the company (including the treasury shares held by Indesit). The  total acquisition price at the dates of the three purchase agreements was $965  million ($75 million for Ms. Claudia Merloni's 4.4% stake in Indesit acquired on  July 17, 2014; $680 million for 42.7% stake of Fineldo S.p.A. acquired on Oct.  14, 2014 and $210 million for the 13.2% stake of certain members of the Merloni  family's acquired on Oct. 14, 2014).  Whirlpool funded the acquisition with borrowings under its long-term credit  facility. The company subsequently borrowed under its CP program to repay the  revolver borrowings. The company intends to repay a portion of the short-term  borrowings with the proposed notes issuance. Whirlpool will now commence the steps to launch a mandatory tender offer for the  remainder of Indesit's outstanding shares, with the intention to delist the  company. The tender offer purchase price per share is equal to about $13.89 per  share (based on the exchange rate as of Sept. 30, 2014). The company expects to  complete the tender offer no later than the first quarter of 2015. On Oct. 24, 2014, Whirlpool's wholly-owned subsidiary, Whirlpool (China)  Investment Co., Ltd., completed its acquisition of a 51% equity stake in Hefei  Rongshida Sanyo Electric Co., Ltd. The aggregate purchase price was RMB 3.4  billion (approximately $551 million based on the exchange rate as of Sept. 30,  2014). Whirlpool funded the acquisition with a combination of cash and other  debt financing. SOLID LIQUIDITY POSITION As of Sept. 30, 2014, Whirlpool had cash of $987 million and no borrowings under  its $2 billion long-term revolving credit facility that matures in 2019 and its  $1 billion 364-day revolving credit facility that matures in September 2015. At  the end of 3Q'14, Whirlpool had $460 million outstanding under its commercial  paper program. A majority of the company's cash is held in foreign countries (approximately 95%  of cash as of Dec. 31, 2013 was held overseas). WHR's intent is to permanently  reinvest these funds outside the U.S. and the company's current plans do not  demonstrate the need to repatriate these funds to support U.S. operations. RATING AFFIRMATION On Oct. 22, 2014, Fitch affirmed the ratings of Whirlpool following the  completion of its acquisition of 60.4% ownership of Indesit. The rating affirmation and Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that debt  to EBITDA will settle at around 1.5x - 2.0x and interest coverage will be above  9.0x within 12-24 months following the completion of the acquisitions of Indesit  and Hefei. Fitch estimates that the company's debt to EBITDA will approximate 2.0x and  funds from operations (FFO) adjusted leverage will be 3.5x by year-end 2015.  Interest coverage is projected to be approximately 10.0x at the conclusion of  2015. Fitch expects the company will reduce leverage in 2016, with debt to EBITDA  projected to be about 1.5x, FFO adjusted leverage situating at 3.0x and interest  coverage above 10.0x at the end of 2016.  RATING SENSITIVITIES While Fitch does not expect a global economic downturn during the next 12  months, the company's risk profile is somewhat heightened by the significant  debt incurred for the acquisition of Indesit as well as the acquisition of a 51%  equity stake in Hefei. Negative rating actions may be considered if there is  significant deterioration in global demand and consequently the company's  operating performance, Whirlpool undertakes shareholder friendly activities  funded by debt, and/or there is material judgment against the company related to  existing regulatory proceedings, leading to leverage levels consistently  exceeding 2.5x and interest coverage falling below 5.5x.  While unlikely in the next 12 months, positive rating actions may be considered  if the company's financial performance is meaningfully better than Fitch's base  case forecast, particularly debt-to-EBITDA consistently situating within a range  of 1.0x - 1.5x and interest coverage sustaining above 10x, as Whirlpool  continues to maintain a solid liquidity position.

42,"   By Harriet McLeod and Niklas Pollard | CHARLOTTE North Carolina/STOCKHOLM  CHARLOTTE North Carolina/STOCKHOLM Sweden's Electrolux said on Thursday it expected a resurgent U.S. economy and cheaper raw materials to slightly boost global demand for home appliances next year.Electrolux, vying for market leadership with U.S. rival Whirlpool Corp and China's Haier Electronics Group Co Ltd, also estimated savings of 1 billion Swedish crowns ($135 million) in 2015 from its latest round of cost cuts, including layoffs and plant closures.Electrolux said the $3.3 billion acquisition of General Electric Co's appliances business will boost U.S. returns.In 2015, Electrolux sees North American demand rising 3 to 5 percent, Europe flat to up to 1 percent, and Latin America flat, senior executives said during a capital markets day in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Latin America is really less about the currencies and more the overall economic climate, particularly in Brazil and Argentina and even Chile slowing down a little bit,"" Electrolux Chief Executive Keith McLoughlin said. ""We've had 12 years of 15 percent compounded growth in appliance demand in Brazil. That's not sustainable."" China's market will be weak in 2015, McLoughlin said, but ""there are still well over a billion people who want the same things we do,"" he said. Southeast Asian demand is positive, and Australia's is flat, he said.A steady fall in raw material prices in recent months will provide a boost next year for Electrolux and its other brands such as AEG and Zanussi, it said. The executives said they expect 2015 earnings of about $250 million crowns, helped by cheaper raw materials.Carbon and steel prices have fallen, but lower oil prices have not reduced plastics prices due to oil refinery problems, McLoughlin said. Electrolux is also banking on a recent $3.3 billion acquisition of GE's appliances business to boost returns from the U.S. market.With GE, Electrolux serves over 90 percent of the U.S. market, up from about 65 percent on its own, McLoughlin said.

44,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO If the U.S. dollar stays at current levels, Whirlpool Corp's (WHR.N) revenue could take a hit of up $1 billion in 2015, but the world's largest appliance maker expects to protect its profits, Chief Executive Officer Jeff Fettig told Reuters on Wednesday. Raising prices in some foreign markets should offset some of the effects of the strong dollar, which reduces the value of goods sold overseas, he said. Fettig said Whirlpool would also benefit from lower commodity prices and cost reductions from restructuring its two recent acquisitions. Earlier on Wednesday, Whirlpool reported 2014 revenue of $19.9 billion and said it expected sales in the U.S. market, its largest, to rise between 4 percent and 6 percent in 2015.Fettig said there were a number of reasons to be optimistic about the U.S. market. U.S. appliance sales peaked a decade ago, before the Great Recession. The average lifespan for many of the products Whirlpool makes - washers, dryers, cooktops, stoves and refrigerators - is also about 10 years.""We're bumping up against replacement demand,"" Fettig said.The U.S. housing market is in the middle of a multiyear housing recovery, Fettig said. ""It still has a long way to go,"" he said, ""but the market is recovering in a manageable way.""   New homes mean new appliances, a boon for Whirlpool.  While falling oil prices are saving consumers money at the pump, Whirlpool is hoping that increased employment and a growing economy will lead to a long-term boost in discretionary spending. ""We need to see the average household income rise,"" Fettig said. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, private-sector wages and benefits ticked up 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter, a sign that higher incomes may be on the way. Fettig said the European market, now a close second in size after the acquisition of Italian appliance maker Indesit, has not recovered but appears to have stabilized. Whirlpool is expecting sales in Europe to be flat to up 2 percent this year.""We're less pessimistic about Europe,"" he said. ""But I wouldn't say we're optimistic yet.""

45,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Whirlpool Corp (WHR.N) on Wednesday said 2015 would be another solid year for U.S. sales of its washers, stoves and refrigerators because of the housing market's recovery and low oil prices, and its shares rose 6 percent.The world's largest maker of home appliances said fourth-quarter earnings fell due to costs from recent acquisitions, but the results beat analysts' expectations. Sales in North America, its largest market, rose 6 percent.Whirlpool also reiterated its 2015 earnings outlook.During a conference call with analysts, executives said Whirlpool expected weaker sales in struggling emerging market economies, particularly Brazil, and that the strong dollar would remain a drag on its results in 2015.Whirlpool reported a net profit of $81 million, or $1.02 a share, down more than 55 percent from $181 million, or $2.26 a share, a year earlier. Excluding acquisition and other costs, Whirlpool said earnings per share for ongoing operations came to $3.52. Analysts on average had expected $3.19, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Last July Whirlpool acquired a majority stake in Italian appliance maker Indesit for $1 billion. The company has been integrating its acquisition of Chinese appliance maker Hefei Rongshida Sanyo Electric Co Ltd, which it announced it would acquire in late 2013 for $552 million. ""Our integration activities remain on track to drive synergies,"" Chief Executive Officer Jeff Fettig said in a statement.Fettig said on the conference call that the acquisition of Indesit and Hefei would afford it greater access to the European and Chinese markets. Revenue in the fourth quarter rose to $6 billion from $5.1 billion. Analysts had expected $5.8 billion. Whirlpool said the strong dollar, which diminishes the value of overseas sales, had hurt revenue in the quarter.The Benton Harbor, Michigan-based company said it expected 2015 earnings per share of $14 to $15.

48,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, March 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB' rating to  Whirlpool Corporation's (NYSE: WHR) proposed offering of Euro 500 million  aggregate amount of senior unsecured notes. The new offering will be equal in  right of payment with all other senior unsecured debt. Whirlpool intends to use  the proceeds from the notes offering for the repayment of a portion of its  commercial paper (CP) borrowings.  INDESIT AND HEFEI ACQUISITIONS On Oct. 14, 2014, Whirlpool completed the acquisition of a 60.4% majority  ownership of Indesit Company S.p.A. (Indesit), representing a 66.8% voting stock  in the company (including the treasury shares held by Indesit). The total  acquisition price at the dates of the three purchase agreements was $965 million  ($75 million for Ms. Claudia Merloni's 4.4% stake in Indesit acquired on July  17, 2014; $680 million for 42.7% stake of Fineldo S.p.A. acquired on Oct. 14,  2014 and $210 million for the 13.2% stake of certain members of the Merloni  family's acquired on Oct. 14, 2014).  On Nov. 28, 2014, the company settled and closed the mandatory tender offer for  the remaining shares of Indesit. The company received tenders for a number of  shares equal to 91.4% of the total shares available for purchase, increasing  Whirlpool's ownership interest in Indesit to 97.1%. The aggregate purchase price  for the shares purchased was EUR344 million (approximately $429 million at the  date of purchase). On Dec. 3, 2014, Whirlpool purchased all the remaining shares of Indesit and  Indesit delisted from the Electronic Stock Market managed by Borsa Italiana  S.p.A. Total consideration paid for Indesit was about $1.4 billion, net of cash  acquired. The company funded the purchase price for the tender offer and the  remaining shares through borrowings under its credit facility and through  borrowings under its CP program. On Oct. 24, 2014, Whirlpool's wholly-owned subsidiary, Whirlpool (China)  Investment Co., Ltd., completed its acquisition of a 51% equity stake in Hefei  Rongshida Sanyo Electric Co., Ltd. The aggregate purchase price was RMB 3.4  billion (approximately $551 million based on the exchange rate as of Sept. 30,  2014). Whirlpool funded the acquisition with a combination of cash and other  debt financing. While Fitch views these transactions as strategically positive for Whirlpool,  these acquisitions meaningfully increased the company's debt and leverage  levels.  As of Dec. 31, 2014, Whirlpool had total debt of $4.35 billion compared  with $2.46 billion at Dec. 31, 2013.  At the end of 2014, Whirlpool's debt to  EBITDA was 2.3x compared with 1.2x at the conclusion of 2013.   KEY RATING DRIVERS On Oct. 22, 2014, Fitch affirmed the ratings of Whirlpool following the  completion of its acquisition of 60.4% ownership of Indesit. Whirlpool's ratings reflect its position as the world's largest appliance  manufacturer, with leading market positions in many regions.  The company's  global operating platform, increased manufacturing efficiency, and  well-recognized skills in innovation have enabled it to improve its cost  structure, compete more effectively around the world, and adjust to volatile  material costs.  Risks include intense global competition, volatility of raw  material costs, sensitivity to business cycles, and ongoing regulatory issues.    The ratings and Stable Outlook also reflect Fitch's expectation that debt to  EBITDA will settle at around 1.5x - 2.0x and interest coverage will be above  9.0x within 12-24 months following the completion of the acquisitions of Indesit  and Hefei. At the end of 2014, Whirlpool's debt to EBITDA was 2.3x and interest  coverage was 11.6x during 2014.  Fitch estimates that the company's debt to EBITDA will approximate 2.0x and  funds from operations (FFO) adjusted leverage will be 3.5x by year-end 2015.  Interest coverage is projected to be approximately 10.0x at the conclusion of  2015. Fitch expects the company will reduce leverage in 2016, with debt to EBITDA  projected to be about 1.5x, FFO adjusted leverage situating at 3.0x and interest  coverage above 10.0x at the end of 2016.  SOLID LIQUIDITY POSITION As of Dec. 31, 2014, Whirlpool had cash of $1.03 billion and no borrowings under  its $2 billion long-term revolving credit facility that matures in 2019 and its  $1 billion 364-day revolving credit facility that matures in September 2015. At  the end of 4Q'14, Whirlpool had $387 million outstanding under its commercial  paper program and $182 million of other short-term borrowings. The company also  has $200 million of senior notes maturing in May 2015. The proposed notes  issuance will be used to repay Whirlpool's CP borrowings. A majority of the company's cash is held in foreign countries (approximately 90%  of cash as of Dec. 31, 2014 was held overseas). WHR's intent is to permanently  reinvest these funds outside the U.S. and the company's current plans do not  demonstrate the need to repatriate these funds to support U.S. operations. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within its rating case for the issuer include: --Total U.S. industry housing starts improve 13.8%, while new and existing home  sales grow 18% and 4.3%, respectively, in 2015; --U.S. home improvement spending advances 6% during 2015. --Revenues grow mid-single-digits on a pro forma basis, driven by moderately  stronger appliance shipments in the U.S. and relatively weak demand  internationally; --EBIT margins improve about 50 bps in 2015; --Debt/EBITDA approximates 2.0x and interest coverage sustains above 10.0x at  the end of 2015; --Whirlpool reports free cash flow margin of 2%-3% during the next few years; --The company does not undertake meaningful share repurchases. RATING SENSITIVITIES While Fitch does not expect a global economic downturn during the next 12  months, the company's risk profile is somewhat heightened by the significant  debt incurred for the acquisition of Indesit as well as the acquisition of a 51%  equity stake in Hefei. Negative rating actions may be considered if there is  significant deterioration in global demand and consequently the company's  operating performance, Whirlpool undertakes shareholder friendly activities  funded by debt, and/or there is material judgment against the company related to  existing regulatory proceedings, leading to leverage levels consistently  exceeding 2.5x and interest coverage falling below 5.5x.  While unlikely in the next 6-12 months, positive rating actions may be  considered if the company's financial performance is meaningfully better than  Fitch's base case forecast, particularly debt-to-EBITDA consistently situating  within a range of 1.0x - 1.5x and interest coverage sustaining above 10x, as  Whirlpool continues to maintain a solid liquidity position.

50,"  ROME U.S. white goods group Whirlpool (WHR.N) announced on Thursday it would invest 500 million euros ($535.25 million) over four years in Italy as part of a restructuring plan that would see 1,350 redundancies.Whirlpool, which is absorbing the operations of Italy's Indesit, met Italian government officials on Thursday to present new investment plans it said were aimed at securing the long term future of its operations in the country.The plan aimed at ""improving efficiencies and capacity utilization and integrating its manufacturing operations,"" Whirlpool said in a statement. It would include the closure of some sites with 400 extra layoffs (described by the company as ""the lowest possible level"") in addition to 950 redundancies already planned at the time it acquired Indesit in July last year.A statement from Italy's industry ministry said the government noted the positive aspects of the plan, which should help bring badly needed investment and return production to Italy from China, Poland and Turkey.But it added that it had ""expressed strong opposition over the aspects connected to employment and the impact on jobs in various sites, some of them in areas of the country already affected by deindustrialisation."" Whirlpool said it would meet unions on April 20 for detailed discussion of the plans, which include the closure of the Carinaro site near Naples with the loss of 800 jobs in a region with one of the highest unemployment in Italy.While Italian industry has hemorrhaged jobs during years of recession, the possible return of some production capacity is welcome news for a country whose once-flourishing white goods sector has declined sharply in recent years due to cheaper foreign competition. A large part of the 500 million euros earmarked for the next four years would be aimed at building up production in Italy through a specialized network of factories and extra investment in research and development, Whirlpool said.According to metalworkers union FIM, which was present at the meeting in Rome, the plans would see production of microwave ovens currently located in China moved to Cassinetta, north of Milan, while a plant near Fabriano in central Italy would take production of cooking surfaces from Poland. Production of clothes dryers currently based in Turkey would be brought to Comunanza, in central Italy, while high capacity washing machines would be produced in Naples.

53,"  ROME, April 16 The Italian government expressed strong opposition on Thursday to plans by Whirlpool to cut jobs as part of its integration of the operations of local whitegoods maker Indesit in southern Italy.The plans include 500 million euros ($538.05 million) over four years in new investments and an increase in output in Italy with the return of some production which had been shifted overseas. However it would also include the closure of some sites with around 400 redundancies.  A statement from the industry ministry said the government noted the positive aspects of the plan ""but at the same time expressed strong opposition over the aspects connected to employment and the impact on jobs in various sites, some of them in areas of the country already affected by deindustrialisation.""

57,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Whirlpool Corp (WHR.N) posted a higher quarterly net income on Tuesday but lowered its profit forecast and sales outlook for 2015, predicting a significant drop in Latin American sales owing largely to Brazil's stagnating economy.The world's largest maker of home appliances said the strength of the U.S. dollar would continue to affect profits this year. Shares in Whirlpool dropped almost 9 percent after the announcement. In February the company warned that the strong greenback, which means overseas sales of its washers and dryers, cooktops, stoves and refrigerators translate into fewer U.S. dollars, could shave $1 billion of its revenue in 2015.In a conference call with analysts, Whirlpool said it has introduced price increases in a number of markets including in Canada, eastern Europe and Brazil to help offset the impact of the strong dollar.The world's largest maker of home appliances reported first-quarter net income up 19 percent year on year to $191 million, or $2.38 a share. Analysts had expected earnings per share of $2.34 for the quarter.  Revenue for the quarter totaled $4.8 billion, up from $4.4 billion a year earlier. Wall Street analysts had predicted first-quarter sales of $5.06 billion.Sales in North America, Whirlpool's biggest market, rose 0.4 percent in the quarter, but plummeted 24 percent in Latin America. In Europe and Asia the company's sales rose dramatically, reflecting recent acquisitions of Italian appliance maker Indesit and Chinese appliance maker Hefei Rongshida Sanyo Electric Co Ltd.The Benton Harbor, Michigan-based company said that cost reductions and recent acquisitions had helped offset the impact of the strong U.S. dollar and falling demand in Brazil during the first quarter. Citing those same problems moving forward, Whirlpool lowered its earnings per share forecast for 2015 to a range of between $12 to $13, from its previous prediction of $14 to $15. Analysts have predicted 2015 earnings for the company of $13.81.Whirlpool said its industry shipments in North America should rise by roughly 4 percent this year, down from its previous forecast of between 4 percent to 6 percent. The company said sales in Latin America should drop in 2015 by between 10 percent to 12 percent, markedly lower than its previous forecast of flat to down 3 percent.Whirlpool left its forecasts for Europe and Asia unchanged.In early trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Whirlpool shares were down more than 8.8 percent at $180.33.

59,"  (Adds details, background, analyst comments, updates markets)* Factory orders rise 2.1 percent on transportation* Orders excluding transportation unchanged* March core capital goods orders revised upBy Lucia MutikaniWASHINGTON, May 4 New orders for U.S. factory goods recorded their biggest increase in eight months in March, boosted by demand for transportation equipment, but the underlying trend remained weak against the backdrop of a strong dollar.The report on Monday from the Commerce Department was the latest indication that the rebound from the first quarter's abrupt slowdown would not be as strong as experienced during the same period last year when output was chilled by cold weather.""It was a difficult winter for manufacturers and it appears they are still hurting after the strong run in the dollar late last year,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York. New orders for manufactured goods increased 2.1 percent, the largest gain since July last year, after dipping 0.1 percent in February. It was the first rise since last August and was buoyed by a 13.5 percent jump in orders for transportation equipment.Orders excluding transportation were flat in March. February's 0.1 percent gain in orders for manufactured goods outside transportation was the first rise since June.The dollar rose against a basket of currencies while prices for U.S. Treasury debt fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with healthcare shares leading the way.Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, has been hit by the strong dollar and lower crude oil prices, which are putting a squeeze on the profits of multinational corporations and oil firms. That together with harsh weather and a now-settled labor dispute at the West Coast ports helped to hold the economy down to a 0.2 percent annual growth pace in the first quarter.The factory data added to reports on auto sales, housing and employment in suggesting the economy was regaining some speed, but probably not fast enough to encourage the Federal Reserve to start raising interest rates next month, as most economists had anticipated at the beginning of the year.The dollar has appreciated 12 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June on expectations of tighter monetary policy and economists estimate it could shave 0.6 percentage point off growth this year.Companies like Schlumberger, the world's No.1 oil-field services provider, and Halliburton have slashed their capital expenditure for this year citing lower oil prices. Multinational corporations, including Procter & Gamble Co , the world's largest household products maker, Colgate-Palmolive and Whirlpool Corp, the world's largest maker of home appliances, have lowered their profit forecasts for the year because of the dollar.The Commerce Department also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans - edged up 0.1 percent instead of the 0.5 percent drop reported last month.""Seldom do things look this bad for the factory sector outside of recession,"" said Tim Quinlan, an economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.""We still maintain that things will improve as the year progresses. The bulk of the declines in activity related to lower energy prices has run its course, baring another significant down leg for oil prices.""Supporting the cautious optimism, order books at factories  rose a bit in March after three straight months of declines.Further gains are likely after a report last week showed some stabilization in factory activity in April after slowing for five straight months, as well as a solid rise in new orders.(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci)",2015-05-04,WHR,"Mon May 4, 2015 | 1:23pm EDT","WRAPUP 2-U.S. factory orders rebound solidly, but trend still soft",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-economy-idUSL1N0XV0WQ20150504?type=companyNews

69,"  (Updates with economists raising Q2 growth estimates)* Factory orders increase 1.8 percent in June* Gain in core capital goods orders lowered to 0.7 percent* Shipments of core capital goods revised to show increaseBy Lucia MutikaniWASHINGTON, Aug 4 New orders for U.S. factory goods rebounded strongly in June on robust demand for transportation equipment and other goods, a hopeful sign for the struggling manufacturing sector.The Commerce Department said on Tuesday new orders for manufactured goods increased 1.8 percent after declining 1.1 percent in May.""We are moving past the very weak period for the manufacturing sector from early on this year, but that activity has yet to meaningfully increase,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.Factory activity has been stymied by a strong dollar and spending cuts in the energy sector after last year's sharp plunge in crude oil prices. Tepid global demand also has weighed on manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the domestic economy. Those factors have eroded the profits of multinational companies like Caterpillar Inc, Procter & Gamble Co , the world's largest household products maker, and Whirlpool Corp, the global home appliances giant.Though there are signs that the energy spending drag is easing, the dollar's strength will likely remain a constraint. The dollar has gained 15 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June 2014.Stocks on Wall Street were little changed, while prices for U.S. government debt fell. The dollar was largely flat against a basket of currencies.Orders for transportation equipment surged 9.3 percent in June, reflecting a 65.4 percent jump in aircraft bookings. There were increases in orders for machinery, furniture, fabricated metal products, electrical equipment, appliances and components.SOLID INVENTORIES The Commerce Department also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans - increased 0.7 percent instead of the 0.9 percent rise reported last month. Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, increased 0.3 percent in June. Shipments were previously reported to have dipped 0.1 percent.Manufacturing inventories increased a solid 0.6 percent, which was more than the government assumed in its second-quarter GDP snapshot published last week.Coming on the heels of a report on Monday showing stronger construction spending in May and April than previously reported, economists said the sturdy increase in factory inventories suggested that second-quarter GDP could be revised to as high as a 3 percent annual pace.The Commerce Department reported last Thursday that the economy expanded at a 2.3 percent pace in the second quarter. It will publish its second GDP estimate for that quarter later this month.In the wake of the construction data, economists had said they expected second-quarter growth would be raised by at least four-tenths of a percentage point to a 2.7 percent pace. They forecast factory inventories adding another 0.3 percentage point.But with the inventories-to-shipments ratio at a lofty 1.35, compared to 1.30 last September, manufacturers might be sitting on a pile of unwanted goods, which could hurt production and weigh on growth in the coming quarters.""It also highlights the probability that an unwinding of this stockpiling will almost assuredly result in a drag on GDP growth in the second half of the year,"" Tim Quinlin, an economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.

The company said changes in the 2015 outlook reflected weaker sales in Latin America, the stronger U.S. dollar and an effort to improve margins.Overall, third-quarter sales jumped 9 percent to $5.3 billion from $4.8 billion a year ago, slightly below expectations of $5.41 billion.The company lowered its estimated 2015 full-year capital spending to a range of $700 million to $750 million, down from a previously forecast $750 million  to $800 million.The company posted a higher quarterly net profit of $235 million, up from $230 million a year ago, citing cost and capacity cuts, acquisitions, and a favorable price mix.Its ongoing business earnings per diluted share rose to $3.45 from $3.04, beating the $3.29 expected by analysts.

79,"   By Jessica Dye  Nov 30 - Whirlpool is headed to a federal appeals court in Ohio to try to thwart a bid to overturn its class-action trial victory against a class of Ohio consumers who said its front-loading washers had a defect that made them prone to develop a smelly mold. The oral arguments, scheduled for Dec. 3 before the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, are the latest skirmish in the long-running ""moldy washer"" litigation, which has already made numerous trips through U.S. appellate courts, as well as the U.S. Supreme Court. Plaintiffs represented by Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein are challenging a series of lower-court rulings they say unfairly tipped the odds against them in the bellwether trial last year.

It's hopeful but they still need to deliver. They're doing their homework with support from Congress, the population and a serious government,"" Brega said at an event in Sao Paulo.By contrast, he said the Brazilian economy is unlikely to rebound strongly after hitting bottom this year. ""There will be a sense of relief - not improvement but relief. That will last until the end of 2018, because the political calendar is dominating the economic calendar. Then the country will resume growth ... after the presidential election.""Investor enthusiasm for Brazil's interim President Michel Temer has been tempered in recent weeks by corruption scandals that forced out two ministers, hurting his business-friendly agenda. The setbacks have weakened support for Temer, strained his coalition and raised the possibility that suspended leftist President Dilma Rousseff could survive a Senate trail and return to office.Brega said the 2018 presidential campaign will be a chance to build social consensus for tax and labor reforms to spur a robust recovery. A poll on Wednesday showed most Brazilians oppose a pension system reform, underscoring the challenges to sweeping policy changes.Whirlpool forecast an industry-wide 10 percent drop in Brazilian appliance sales this year, but Brega said the company has captured a larger share of revenue in the shrinking market. Since the end of 2013, Whirlpool has avoided rehiring as jobs turn over, reducing its head count in Brazil by 25 percent or more in two years, he said, adding that there are no plans to expand production in the country.Brega recounted the painful experience of overseeing the 2002 closure of Whirlpool's last plant in Argentina during a severe crisis. Since then the company has made appliances in the country through local partnerships.By September, Whirlpool plans to open a plant in Argentina making cooking appliances, he said, adding that there were plans for refrigerator and washing machine production lines over the next five years.(Reporting by Brad Haynes; Editing by Tom Brown)",2016-06-08,WHR,"Wed Jun 8, 2016 | 6:47pm EDT","CORRECTED (OFFICIAL)-UPDATE 1-Whirlpool readies new Argentina plant, plans two more lines",http://www.reuters.com//article/whirlpool-brazil-idUSL1N1901E4?type=companyNews

101,"  WASHINGTON The U.S. Commerce Department said in a statement on Wednesday it had determined that large home washing machines from China had been dumped in the United States.U.S. appliance maker Whirlpool Corp (WHR.N) had urged the government in December to impose duties on washing machines manufactured in China by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) and LG Electronics (066570.KS).Whirlpool had alleged that the machines were being sold in the United States at prices below production costs.Samsung and LG will be required to pay cash deposits on washing machines imported from their production facilities in China following the ruling, Whirlpool said in a statement.The cash deposit rate for Samsung is 111.09 percent, and the rate for LG is 49.88 percent. In 2014, imports of large home washing machines from China were valued at an estimated $899.4 million, according to the Commerce Department.China's Commerce Ministry said the U.S. methodology was incorrect, urging the U.S. to listen to the opinions of the companies involved and to ""abandon its mistaken methods"". The companies involved were all multinationals and China hoped both sides could address each other's concerns via talks to avoid worsening the situation, the ministry added.    The United States slapped duties in 2012 on Samsung and LG washing machines made in South Korea and Mexico after finding the products were sold too cheaply in the United States or benefited from unfair levels of government support. Whirlpool had said the duties were being circumvented by shifting production to Chinese factories.

106,"   By Meredith Davis  Whirlpool Corp's (WHR.N) biggest challenge in the last year has been managing rapid change and currency volatility in global markets such as turmoil after Britain's vote to leave the European Union, Chief Executive Officer Jeff Fettig said in an interview on Friday. ""The best example is Brexit and what has surprisingly happened in a short period of time, in the U.K., which impacted us but we were able to overcome it,"" Fettig said. Britain, where Whirlpool records about $1 billion in revenues, this summer voted to leave the European Union in a vote known as Brexit.The pound's value fell after the vote, which forced the company to raise its prices, Fettig said. A weak pound will reduce revenue and profit, meanwhile the cost to import appliances from other European Union countries, where they are largely manufactured, rises, Fettig said.""Local prices in the U.K. will go up. It is too early to say what impact it will have on demand, but we are assuming there could be a much weaker demand environment, at least for the short term,"" he said. With slowed demand from Russia and China, Whirlpool's leadership focused on adjusting to the changing global economic environment, Fettig said.Last year the U.S. dollar strengthened against all major currencies, and Whirlpool faced a recession in Brazil, its largest Latin American market.Despite the global economic volatility, Whirlpool posted a higher-than-expected quarterly net profit on Friday.   ""We had a record year last year, we had a record first half this year,"" Fettig said. ""We've been able to respond very quickly to changes in our market and environment, because that is the world we live in. So I feel very good about what we've been able to do over the last year,"" he said.  Whirlpool said ongoing business earnings per share rose to $3.50 from $2.70 a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected $3.36, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.In Latin America, sales fell 3.4 percent to $826 million, but excluding currency exchange the company said sales rose 4 percent.   ""If the (Brazilian) currency stays where it is today, beginning mid-third quarter, we won't have anymore bad currency comparisons, so we would have finally lapped the bad news of last year,"" Fettig said.Whirlpool's adjustments depend on the market, but in Brazil the company focused on lowering costs, raising prices because of local inflation and investing in new products.
