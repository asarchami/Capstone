0,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 29 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB-' rating to the $600  million of senior secured bonds issued by Universal Health Services, Inc. (NYSE:  UHS), consisting of $300 million due 2019 and $300 million due 2022. The  proceeds are expected to be used to refinance existing indebtedness. Assuming substantially all the debt proceeds are used for refinancing, Fitch  views the transaction as favorable to UHS's credit profile, since it will  refinance a portion of debt due in the 2015-2016 timeframe. At March 31, 2014,  2016 maturities represented 86% of total debt outstanding. Subsequent to this  transaction, this figure could fall to below 70%. UHS has good flexibility at its current 'BB+' rating in the event that not all  the proceeds from this issuance are used for refinancing existing debt. UHS's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is currently 'BB+'. The Rating Outlook is  Stable. A full list of UHS's ratings follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS -- UHS has continued to demonstrate a commitment to debt repayment, resulting in  debt-to-EBITDA of 2.3x at March 31, 2014 compared to 4.9x (reported) at Dec. 31,  2010. Fitch expects UHS to operate with debt leverage of 2.25x-3x over the  ratings horizon. -- Unlike many of its peers, UHS has not engaged in large-scale acquisitions  since its $3.1 billion purchase of PSI in 2010. Fitch expects UHS to pursue  moderately-sized, targeted acquisitions over the ratings horizon. The 'BB+'  rating provides ample flexibility for UHS to incur additional debt in order to  participate in the ongoing consolidation of the U.S. healthcare provider space. -- Cash flows are strengthening on a stabilizing acute care business, better  margins due to lower uncompensated care, and growing behavioral health  operations. Fitch anticipates that UHS will generate solid free cash flow (FCF)  of $550 million-$700 million in 2014-2015, compared to $477 million for the  latest 12 month (LTM) period ended March 31, 2014. -- UHS's behavioral health business accounts for more than half of its overall  revenues, providing business and revenue diversification as well as improved  financial stability and profitability. Good organic growth in the mid-single  digits, driven by mental health parity rules and UHS's capacity growth  initiatives, and moderate margin improvement are expected over the ratings  horizon. -- UHS's same-hospital admissions were flat in 2013, better than the 2% and 2.2%  declines in 2012 and 2011, respectively, and stronger than many of its  for-profit peers. Fitch expects moderately negative to possibly flat acute care  inpatient admissions growth to be indicative of stable markets for the  foreseeable future. Pricing metrics continue to remain stable as lingering  unfavorable payor mix has been offset by relatively strong commercial  reimbursement rate increases. -- Fitch views the Affordable Care Act (ACA) as a net positive for UHS and its  hospital operator peers. Net revenue growth from declining uncompensated care,  on a fairly constant cost base, will drive an increase in absolute profits  during 2014-2015. Fitch believes it is likely, however, that profit gains will  begin to erode in later years due to an overall constrained healthcare  reimbursement environment. RATING SENSITIVITIES Maintenance of a 'BB+' IDR will require a continued demonstrated commitment to  operating with debt leverage below 3x, with FCF-to-adjusted debt of 8% or  higher. Fitch notes that UHS has good flexibility at the current 'BB+' level to  consummate debt-funded M&A, especially as it supports longer-term growth in  light of prevailing trends in healthcare (i.e. integrated care delivery,  physician employment, outpatient service line expansion, etc.). A downgrade of UHS's IDR to 'BB' could result from pressured margins and cash  flows - or a large, leveraging transaction - that results in debt leverage  expected to be sustained above 3x and/or FCF-to-gross adjusted debt below 8%.  Margin and cash flow pressures of this magnitude are not likely to occur  abruptly, but could materialize due to severe pricing pressures or unfavorable  large-scale reform of Medicare and/or Medicaid programs. Also, the availability  of single M&A transactions that could drive a downgrade is limited. An upgrade of UHS's IDR to 'BBB-' is unlikely in the near- to intermediate-term,  as Fitch views the risks around reimbursement and other regulatory factors  associated with healthcare providers in the U.S. - and UHS's reliance on  government payers - as material going forward. Furthermore, UHS's current  ratings and credit metrics provide the firm with flexibility to participate in  the consolidation of the healthcare provider space, which Fitch expects to  continue through the intermediate term. MOST DEBT MATURES IN 2016, LIQUIDITY IS AMPLE Available liquidity is sufficient. Though UHS does not usually carry large  amounts of cash ($16 million at March 31, 2014), it maintains an $800 million  revolver, of which $743 million was available at March 31, 2014. UHS also  maintains a $275 million A/R facility, of which $115 million was available at  March 31, 2014. Debt maturities are manageable for the firm, though the bulk of the outstanding  term loans are due in August 2016 (2016 maturities represent 86% of total debt).  Fitch expects UHS will have adequate access to capital as it seeks to refinance  its credit facilities in advance of this date. Estimated debt maturities at  March 31, 2014 are as follows: remainder of 2014: $56 million; 2015: $123  million; 2016: $2.77 billion; 2018: $250 million. NOTCHING SCHEME The secured debt rating is one notch above the IDR, illustrating Fitch's  expectation for superior recovery prospects in the event of default.  Furthermore, Fitch believes UHS has good financial flexibility at the 'BB+' IDR,  supporting the one-notch differential.  The unsecured notes are rated one notch below the IDR to reflect the substantial  amount of secured debt to which they are subordinated. More than 90% of UHS's  outstanding debt at March 31, 2014 was secured, reducing the potential  recoveries for unsecured creditors. Fitch rates UHS as follows: -- IDR 'BB+'; -- Senior secured bank facility 'BBB-'; -- Senior secured bonds 'BBB-'; -- Senior unsecured bonds 'BB'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

4,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, June 24 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Universal Health Services  Inc.'s (UHS) ratings, including the Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BB+'. A  complete list of ratings follows at the end of the release. The ratings apply to  approximately $3.1 billion of debt at March 31, 2015. The Rating Outlook is  Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS --UHS has the strongest balance sheet in the for-profit hospital sector, with  total debt-to-EBITDA of 1.9x at March 31, 2015). Fitch expects UHS to operate  with leverage between 2x and 3x over the ratings horizon. --Unlike many of its peers, UHS has not engaged in large-scale acquisitions  since its $3.1 billion purchase of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. (PSI) in 2010.  Fitch expects UHS to pursue more deals in 2015-2016, likely moderate-sized,  targeted acquisitions. UHS has a good degree of flexibility in credit metrics at  'BB+' rating to incur additional debt to fund M&A. --Cash flows are strengthening on a stabilizing acute care hospital business -  aided by coverage expansion provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) - and  growing behavioral health operations. Free cash flow (FCF) totaled $682 million  for the LTM period ended March 31, 2015. Fitch anticipates that UHS will  generate solid FCF of around $800 million in 2015-2016. --UHS behavioral health (BH) business accounts for more than half of the  company's revenues, this diversification business model enhances financial  stability and profitability. Good organic growth in the mid-single digits,  driven by mental health parity rules and UHS' capacity growth initiatives, and  moderately improving profit margins are expected over the ratings horizon for  the BH business. --UHS' same-hospital (SH) acute care admissions growth for the first quarter  2015 and fourth quarter 2014 were 4.3% and 3.5%, respectively. SH acute care  admissions were flat in 2014 and 2013, but better than the 2% and 2.2% declines  in 2012 and 2011, respectively. While some of UHS' largest acute care hospital  markets were hard hit during the recession (Texas, Las Vegas), these markets  have benefitted the most from the good economic recovery, aiding in UHS'  positive growth. --Fitch views the ACA as a net positive for UHS and its hospital operator peers.  Fitch expects net revenue growth from declining uncompensated care, on a fairly  constant cost base, to drive an increase in absolute profits during 2015. Fitch  thinks it is likely, however, that profit gains will begin to erode in later  years due to a constrained healthcare reimbursement for the foreseeable future. Potential for More, Larger Deals Most large acute care hospital operators have been active acquirers and  aggressive in recruiting physicians and expanding outpatient service line  offerings over the last few years. UHS has instead directed most of its FCF  toward debt repayment. Debt-to-EBITDA has declined to 1.9x at March 31, 2015  from nearly 5x (reported) at year-end 2010.  Each of UHS' acquisitions over the past four years has been of behavioral health  targets, including the $500 million acquisition of Ascend Health Corporation in  Oct. 2012 and the $431 million acquisition of Cygnet Health Care in September  2014. Going forward, most targets are likely to be in this range, with purchase  prices of $300 million to $500 million, as well as small not-for-profit (NFP)  hospitals or behavioral health operations of local NFPs below $100 million.  Fitch does not expect UHS to engage another transformational deal - like the  2010 PSI acquisition - over the ratings horizon, partly because a lack of  targets of that size in the fragmented behavioral health segment.  Despite the lack of capital directed toward M&A, UHS has been investing in its  acute care business through capital expenditures. A new hospital opened in UHS'  southern California market in second-half 2013. Furthermore, UHS reports that  the majority of its discretionary capex is used for acute care facilities. It is  possible that UHS could pursue acquisitions of acute care hospitals, as  management has commented that purchase multiples seem to be moderating for  possible targets. SCOTUS Review of Health Insurance Subsidies There remains a significant amount of uncertainty regarding the ACA's ultimate  impact on the hospital sector. Most immediately, the upcoming SCOTUS decision on  the legality of tax subsidies for health plan exchange plan enrolees, and future  state Medicaid expansion decisions are major questions marks. However, any  changes to the ACA are unlikely to be impactful enough to business profiles and  financial flexibility to move the ratings of hospital companies in the medium  term. Improving Underlying Volumes; Pricing Dynamics from Expansion Coverage Fitch believes that strength in organic volume performance in the acute care  hospital segment is likely to persist in the first half of 2015, continuing from  the positive volume performance in 4Q14 and 1Q15. In addition, the effects of  the ACA health insurance exchange enrollments were muted in 1Q14, and there  should be some ramp up given the strong uptake in public exchange plans during  the second open enrollment period. UHS is among the best-positioned for-profit hospital operators to benefit from  lower bad debts due to the health insurance coverage expansion elements of the  ACA due to its presence in states expanding their Medicaid programs, including  Nevada and California. Fitch thinks EBITDA margins at UHS' acute care business  could expand by 150-200 bps or more from 2013 to 2015. Such margin gain is  expected to slowly erode in the years that follow, however, due to an overall  constrained reimbursement environment and the expectation for inpatient volumes  to remain relatively flat or slightly down for the foreseeable future. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch expects low single digit organic topline growth in the acute care segment  through the forecast period. This incorporates the assumption that both patient  volumes and pricing will show some pull back from the strong results of the past  couple quarters. Secular headwinds to growth in the hospital sector remain  intact, comparisons will become more difficult in the second half of 2015, and  the tailwind from the ACA health insurance expansion is likely to taper. The  behavioral health segment will continue to contribute stability to UHS'  operating profile. Fitch forecasts EBITDA of $1.7 billion and free cash flow (FCF; CFO less capital  expenditures and dividends) of about $800 million for UHS in 2015, including the  contribution of recent acquisitions. Fitch expects UHS' operating EBITDA margin to remain relatively flat in 2015  versus 2014. This is driven by the expectation for continued improvement in some  of UHS' largest markets (South Texas, Las Vegas), tempered by some negative  operating leverage as the recently very strong overall volume growth recedes. Capital expenditures are forecasted at $400 million in 2015. The company deploys  cash for both acquisitions and share repurchases; total debt is maintained at a  level commensurate with the 'BB+' rating. RATING SENSITIVITIES Maintenance of a 'BB+' IDR will require a continued demonstrated commitment to  operating with debt leverage below 3x, with FCF-to-adjusted debt of 8% or  higher. Fitch notes that UHS' has good flexibility at the current 'BB+' ratings  to consummate debt-funded M&A, especially as it supports longer-term growth in  light of prevailing trends in healthcare (i.e. integrated care delivery,  physician employment, outpatient service lines, etc.). A downgrade of UHS' IDR to 'BB' could result from pressured margins and cash  flows - or a large, leveraging transaction - that results in debt leverage  expected to be sustained above 3x and/or FCF-to-gross adjusted debt below 8%.  Margin and cash flow pressures of this magnitude are not likely occur abruptly,  but could materialize due to severe pricing pressures or unfavorable large-scale  reform of Medicare and/or Medicaid programs.  An upgrade of UHS' IDR to 'BBB-' is unlikely in the near-term, since UHS'  current ratings and credit metrics provide the firm with flexibility to  participate in the consolidation of the healthcare provider space, which Fitch  expects to continue through the intermediate-term. DEBT MATURITIES EXTENDED, LIQUIDITY SOLID Available liquidity is sufficient. Though UHS does not usually carry large  amounts of cash ($35 million at March 31, 2015), it maintains an $800 million  revolver, of which $739 million was available at March 31, 2015. UHS also  maintains a $360 million A/R facility, of which $35 million was available at  March 31, 2015. Debt maturities are manageable for the firm. The 2014 recapitalization  transaction extended UHS' debt maturity wall out past 2016. The $400 million  senior secured notes remain due in 2016, but the term loans and new secured  notes do not start to mature until 2019.  FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch affirms UHS' ratings and assigns Recovery Ratings (RRs) as indicated: --IDR at 'BB+'; --Senior secured bank facility at 'BBB-/RR1'; --Senior secured bonds at 'BBB-/RR1'; The Rating Outlook is Stable.

5,"   By Caroline Humer | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Humana Inc, fresh from announcing an agreement to be purchased by larger rival Aetna Inc, prompted new investor concerns about the $33 billion deal on Monday by lowering its 2015 financial forecasts. The transaction announced on Friday is already expected to face a tough review by U.S. antitrust regulators, particularly if another major deal among health insurers emerges. Humana, which has posted disappointing results for several quarters in a row, said on Monday that members of its Medicare Advantage plans for the elderly were using hospital services at a higher rate than the company expected. That increase could cut into already tight profit margins, if Humana ends up paying more for medical claims than they anticipated when setting monthly insurance rates.Humana CEO Bruce Broussard said on a conference call with investors that inpatient hospital admissions have not performed in line with what the company had forecast. That contributed to its decision to slash expected 2015 operating profits by more than 8 percent. The company said it had taken the higher Medicare Advantage hospital use into account when it priced premiums for 2016. ""If you take the 8 percent downgrade of their earnings and roll that through, that makes what Aetna paid pretty expensive,"" said Joel Emery, a portfolio manager at Tareo Capital Management in New York. The degree to which Humana will boost Aetna's earnings in 2017 and 2018 is less than what some investors had hoped for, he said.Aetna's offer of $125 in cash and 0.8375 Aetna shares for each Humana share valued Humana at $230 per share. On Monday, Aetna fell 6 percent to $117, bringing down the offer price to $223 per share.Reflecting growing doubts about the deal, Humana shares traded well below the proposed offer price, closing at $188.96. ""Aetna shareholders have to approve the deal, and with such a large premium, there is some outside chance that shareholders will not approve it,"" said Standard & Poor's equity analyst Jeffrey Loo.Humana's negative comments provided a silver lining to hospital operators, who stand to benefit if patient admissions rise and they are reimbursed for more of their services, said Les Funtledyer, portfolio manager at ESquared asset management. He owns shares of HCA Holdings and Universal Health Services.  Consolidation among health insurers is also spurring investors to seek out cheaper stocks in the healthcare sector, such as hospitals, said Jessica Bemer, portfolio manager for Snow Capital Management in Sewickley, Pennsylvania. ""If there are fewer insurers for healthcare investors to own, that means they have to get their healthcare exposure elsewhere,"" Bemer said.Shares of Community Health Systems, Tenet Healthcare and HCA bucked the overall market's decline and gained 0.7 percent, 0.5 percent and 1.8 percent on Monday. Bemer holds Community Health shares.

Reflecting growing doubts about the deal, Humana shares traded well below the proposed offer price, closing at $188.96.""Aetna shareholders have to approve the deal, and with such a large premium, there is some outside chance that shareholders will not approve it,"" said Standard & Poor's equity analyst Jeffrey Loo. Humana's negative comments provided a silver lining to hospital operators, who stand to benefit if patient admissions rise and they are reimbursed for more of their services, said Les Funtledyer, portfolio manager at ESquared asset management. He owns shares of HCA Holdings and Universal Health Services.Consolidation among health insurers is also spurring investors to seek out cheaper stocks in the healthcare sector, such as hospitals, said Jessica Bemer, portfolio manager for Snow Capital Management in Sewickley, Pennsylvania.""If there are fewer insurers for healthcare investors to own, that means they have to get their healthcare exposure elsewhere,"" Bemer said.Shares of Community Health Systems, Tenet Healthcare  and HCA bucked the overall market's decline and gained 0.7 percent, 0.5 percent and 1.8 percent on Monday. Bemer holds Community Health shares.

10,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, August 29 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of Universal  Health Services, Inc. (NYSE: UHS), including the Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at  'BB+' and the senior secured credit facility and senior secured bond ratings at  'BBB-/RR1'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of rating actions, which apply to approximately $3.6 billion of debt  outstanding at June 30, 2016, is found at the end of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Low Debt Leverage: Gross debt/EBITDA of 2.1x at June 30, 2016 is the lowest  among Fitch-rated hospital companies, driven by management's more conservative  balance sheet management and M&A strategy. Fitch expects UHS to operate with  gross debt/EBITDA below 3x over the ratings horizon, with temporary increases  for moderate-sized M&A possible. Solid Cash Flows: Cash flows are solid, with LTM FCF of nearly $680 million at  June 30, 2016, supported by the more profitable behavioral health business and  improved acute care volumes in favorable markets. Improving cash generation will  be more closely tied to success in growing outpatient capabilities over the  ratings horizon. Diversification, Stability from Behavioral Health: UHS' behavioral health  business provides increased business and revenue diversification, as well as  improved longer-term financial stability and profitability. Good organic growth  in the mid-single digits and moderately improving profit margins are expected  over the ratings horizon. Recent acquisitions are in line with Fitch's  expectation that opportunities to expand the behavioral health segment will be a  primary focus of capital deployment for UHS. Leading Acute Care Results: UHS' acute care segment continues to outperform its  peers, with both volumes and pricing growth being sustained in the mid-single  digits. Fitch expects UHS to continue reporting volumes and pricing metrics that  are among the best in the industry, due in large part to its strong market  shares in favorable urban markets where volumes tend to be weighted toward a  higher-acuity patient mix. Dynamic Operating Environment: Fitch expects 2016 to be less favorable for UHS  and its for-profit acute care hospital peers, as volumes shift toward lower-cost  outpatient facilities and are compared to an exceptional 2015. Hospital industry  management teams are contending with a very dynamic operating environment due to  the evolution of payment schemes, developing trends around care coordination,  and other regulatory reforms influencing organic operating trends. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Revenue growth in the high-single digits, with roughly equal contributions  from each of acute care, behavioral health, and acquisitions in 2016.  --Slower organic growth in 2017-2018 due to secular headwinds facing the acute  care industry. --Stable to modestly improving operating EBITDA margins, facing headwinds in  2017 and beyond, primarily due to negative operating leverage as particularly  inpatient volume growth rates normalize versus the higher level seen in  2014-2015. --The majority of discretionary FCF directed towards share repurchases and  acquisitions, resulting in gross debt/EBITDA around 2x-2.5x through the forecast  period. RATING SENSITIVITIES Maintenance of a 'BB+' IDR will require a continued demonstrated commitment to  operating with debt leverage below 3x, with FCF-to-adjusted debt of 8% or  higher. UHS has good flexibility at the current 'BB+' level to consummate  debt-funded M&A, especially as it supports longer-term growth in light of  prevailing trends in U.S. healthcare (i.e. care coordination, physician  employment, outpatient service lines, etc.). A downgrade of UHS' IDR to 'BB' could result from pressured margins and cash  flows - or a large, leveraging transaction - that results in debt leverage  expected to be sustained above 3x and/or FCF-to-gross adjusted debt below 8%.  Margin and cash flow pressures of this magnitude are not likely to occur  abruptly, but could materialize due to severe pricing pressures or unfavorable  large-scale reform of Medicare and/or Medicaid programs.  With the potential for the company to continue participating in industry  consolidation through debt-financed transactions, an upgrade would be considered  should the company publicly commit to operating with leverage under 2.5x on a  sustained basis. Given industry consolidation trends and the significantly  higher leverage profiles of UHS's peers, Fitch does not anticipate UHS making a  public leverage commitment to support an investment grade profile. Furthermore,  Fitch notes that the risks around reimbursement and other regulatory factors  associated with healthcare providers in the U.S. - and UHS's reliance on  government payers - is a material risk for UHS and its peers going forward. LIQUIDITY Manageable Debt Maturities: Recent refinancing of the bonds due 2016 has  extended the nearest maturity to the end of 2018 when the A/R facility expires.  The following year, $300 million of senior secured bonds and the $1.9 billion of  term loans come due.  Sufficient Available Liquidity: Though UHS does not usually carry large amounts  of cash ($56 million at June 30, 2016), it maintains an $800 million revolver,  of which $751 million was available at June 30, 2016. UHS also maintains a $400  million A/R facility, of which $120 million was available at June 30, 2016. The  entire amount of cash is considered 'readily available'. UHS typically uses its  revolver and A/R facility to fund working capital and other operational needs,  more recently refinancing outstanding amounts with longer-dated debt. Cash Directed Toward Deals: Fitch expects UHS to continue the more aggressive  acquisition strategy evidenced in 2014-2016 - though still more conservative  than most of its peers - as consolidation continues among healthcare providers.  Management has commented that it is beginning to see the pipeline of possible  deals increase. Physician employment and expansion into non-acute/ambulatory  sectors are likely to continue representing strategic uses of cash for the  sector going forward. NOTCHING SCHEME The secured debt rating remains one notch above the IDR, illustrating Fitch's  expectation for superior recovery prospects in the event of default.  Furthermore, Fitch believes UHS has good financial flexibility at the 'BB+' IDR,  illustrated by relatively low secured debt leverage, supporting the one notch  uplift.  The incurrence of material additional secured debt that pushed secured debt  leverage toward 2.5x-3x could support consideration of downgrading the secured  debt ratings by one notch, to 'BB+'. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS --Long-Term IDR at 'BB+'; --Senior secured credit facility at 'BBB-/RR1'; --Senior secured bonds at 'BBB-/RR1'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.
