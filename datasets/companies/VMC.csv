0,"  (Adds details and background)WASHINGTON, July 29 The U.S. Senate on Tuesday approved an $8.1 billion short-term extension of federal funding for transportation projects through  the end of 2014, setting up a clash with the House of Representatives just days ahead of cutbacks in money for road, bridge and transit construction.The Democratic-controlled Senate had been considering a House-passed measure for a longer-term extension through May 2015, but reduced the amount of money with the aim of forcing Congress to approve a long-term transport funding bill in the post-election ""lame duck"" session of Congress in November.The final bill, which stripped the main funding mechanism in the House-passed measure, revenue from pension accounting changes, passed by a strong bipartisan vote of 79-18.The vote raises the stakes for Congress as a twin deadline looms on Friday for a reduction in payments to states from the Highway Trust Fund and the start of a five-week summer recess for lawmakers. Republican House Speaker John Boehner earlier on Tuesday said the House would simply strip any changes made by the Senate to the transportation funding bill and send back the original House version to the Senate for approval.Such legislative ""ping-pong"" with time running out raises the risk that Congress will not replenish the rapidly dwindling Highway Trust Fund before Friday. The Department of Transportation has said that it will begin to curtail payments from the fund to states by as much as 30 percent starting that day, a move that lawmakers and state transportation directors say could halt planning work for major projects and lead to the layoffs of hundreds of thousands of construction workers.State transportation directors and business groups have been clamoring for a long-term solution that would eliminate uncertainty over the funding of road and rail transit projects that benefit the heavy construction industry and its suppliers, including Fluor Corp, Vulcan Materials, LaFarge SA and Caterpillar Inc. The House earlier this month approved a $10.9 billion funding patch largely funded through ""pension smoothing,"" which allows companies to reduce their contributions to employee pensions, thus increasing profits.It also would extend customs fees for another year transfer $1 billion from a fund, measures in common with the Senate bill.But the Senate measure substituted some other provisions to raise revenue by improving tax compliance, such as increased reporting requirements for mortgage interest deductions.

The vote raises the stakes for Congress as a twin deadline looms on Friday for a reduction in payments to states from the  Highway Trust Fund and the start of a five-week summer recess for lawmakers.Republican House Speaker John Boehner earlier on Tuesday said the House would simply strip any changes made by the Senate to the transportation funding bill and send back the original House version to the Senate for approval.

2,"  (Updates with planned Senate vote on House plan)By David LawderWASHINGTON, July 31 With time running out to avert cutbacks in federal transportation money due to start on Friday, Democratic leaders in the U.S. Senate agreed to accept a Republican plan to extend funding for highway and transit construction through May 2015.Senate Majority Harry Reid said he would put the House of Representatives' $10.9 billion funding plan to a vote on Thursday evening after the House rejected a shorter, $8.1 billion extension passed by the Senate.The legislative ping-pong has heightened uncertainty over the dwindling Highway Trust Fund as Congress prepares to start a five-week summer recess this weekend. The Department of Transportation has said it will start on Friday reducing payments to states by as much as 30 percent from the dwindling Highway Trust Fund.Lawmakers and transportation officials say that failure to approve new funding would cause work slowdowns at the height of summer road construction season and halt planning for new projects, putting thousands of construction jobs at risk.The Senate on Tuesday approved the shorter extension, lasting only through the end of 2014, because Democrats wanted to force Congress to act on a long-term funding plan during the post-election, lame duck session of Congress in November. But in a vote that Democratic aides said was engineered to ""jam"" the Senate just before the recess, the House earlier on Thursday rejected the Senate plan and sent back its original version. That left senators little choice but to take the House plan or face criticism for allowing the trust fund to be depleted.Representative Peter DeFazio, a Democrat, complained that the Republican extension bill would discourage Congress from passing a multi-year transport funding plan until next year. ""We'll limp along until next May and there'll be incredible uncertainty about the next construction season,"" DeFazio said. ""There won't be major new projects planned.""State transportation directors and business groups have been clamoring for a long-term solution that would eliminate uncertainty over the funding of road and rail transit projects that benefit the heavy construction industry and its suppliers, including Fluor Corp, Vulcan Materials, LaFarge SA and Caterpillar Inc.The Highway Trust Fund has suffered chronic shortfalls in recent years as revenue from fuel taxes, unchanged since 1993, have failed to keep pace with rising construction costs and been hit by improved vehicle fuel economy.

3,"   By David Lawder | WASHINGTON, July 31  WASHINGTON, July 31 The U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday was poised to reject a Senate-passed $8.1 billion measure to fund transportation projects through 2014 in a bid to force through Republicans' plans that would extend funding until May.The House's vote to send its $10.9 billion plan back to the Senate, scheduled for Thursday afternoon, would raise the risk that Congress fails to meet a Friday deadline to avert federal funding cutbacks for road, bridge and rail transit construction projects.Congress is set to begin a five-week summer recess on Friday, the day that the Department of Transportation has said it will start reducing payments to states by as much as 30 percent from the dwindling Highway Trust Fund.Lawmakers and transportation officials say that failure to approve new funding would cause work slowdowns at the height of summer road construction season and halt planning for new projects, putting thousands of construction jobs at risk. The House vote was engineered to ""jam"" the Senate, Democratic aides said. With no legislative time left, senators would be faced with a difficult choice: Accept the House plan as is or face criticism for allowing the Highway Trust Fund to run dry in August.A temporary $10.9 billion transportation funding extension through May 2015 seemed on a drama-free path toward approval until Tuesday, when a Senate amendment cut the amount to $8.1 billion. Senate Democrats wanted the shorter extension to try to force Congress to act on a long-term funding plan during the post-election, ""lame duck"" session of Congress in November. They argued that the House plan would put off action until next year, creating a funding crisis at the start of a new construction season and leaving decisions to the next Congress.State transportation directors and business groups have been clamoring for a long-term solution that would eliminate uncertainty over the funding of road and rail transit projects that benefit the heavy construction industry and its suppliers, including Fluor Corp, Vulcan Materials, LaFarge SA and Caterpillar Inc.

4,"  (Recasts with Senate passage, new lawmaker quote)By David LawderWASHINGTON, July 31 The U.S. Congress on Thursday approved a $10.9 billion funding extension for transportation construction projects through May 2015, averting a cutback in federal payments to states that was due to start on Friday.Senate approval by a vote of 81-13 sent the measure to President Barack Obama to be signed into law after it bounced back and forth between the Senate and House of Representatives this week, raising uncertainty over the dwindling Highway Trust Fund.The Senate on Tuesday had passed a smaller $8.1 billion plan lasting only through the end of 2014 that aimed to force action on a long-term highway and mass transit funding plan during the post-election, ""lame duck"" session of Congress. But the House earlier on Thursday rejected the Senate plan and sent back its longer extension, which Democrats complained would put off consideration of long-term funding until next year, when a newly elected Congress takes office.In the end, senators from both parties were unwilling to  risk blame for allowing the Highway Trust Fund to run dry as they start a five-week summer recess on Friday.""We really can't walk away from the Highway Trust Fund, we can't let it stagger and fall. Millions of jobs and thousands of businesses depend on it,"" said Senator Barbara Boxer, a Democrat who was the chief proponent of the shorter extension. The Department of Transportation had said that on Friday it would start reducing payments to states by as much as 30 percent from the fund, which is financed through fuel taxes.Lawmakers and transportation officials had warned that such cutbacks would cause work slowdowns at the height of summer road construction season and halt planning for new projects, putting thousands of construction jobs at risk.
