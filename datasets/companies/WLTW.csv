6,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 23 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a senior unsecured debt  rating of 'BBB' to Trinity Acquisition plc's new issue of EUR540 million 2.125%  senior notes due 2022. Trinity is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Willis  Towers Watson, PLC (WLTW)). A full list of WLTW's ratings follows at the end of  this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Trinity intends to use the net proceeds of the offering, together with existing  cash resources, to repay amounts under WLTW's bridge-loan facility.  Fitch upgraded WLTW's ratings on Jan. 6, 2016 following the announcement that  the merger of Willis Group Holdings and Towers Watson & Co. (TW) was completed.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that could result in a downgrade include a material  near-term change in financial profile or operating performance of the combined  company, a failure to maintain EBITDA-to-interest ratios of 7x or higher, an  increase in financial leverage evidenced by debt/EBITDA above 2.5x, or a  material goodwill impairment that casts doubt on the new entities' ability to  generate future earnings and cash flows.  Key rating triggers that could result in an upgrade include realization and  evidence of the benefits of the TW and Gras Savoye mergers with continuing  improved margins and ultimate improvement in the debt-to-EBITDA ratio and  EBITDA-to-interest ratios in line with higher rated peers.  FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has assigned the following ratings: Trinity Acquisition plc --EUR 540 million senior notes due 2022. Fitch currently rates WLTW as follows: Willis Towers Watson PLC (formerly Willis Group Holdings)  --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'BBB'; --4.125% senior unsecured notes due 2016 'BBB';  --5.75% senior unsecured notes due 2021 'BBB'; --3.5% senior notes due 2021 'BBB'; --4.4% senior notes due 2026 'BBB'. Willis North America Inc. --IDR 'BBB'; --6.2% senior unsecured notes due 2017 'BBB'; --7.00% senior notes due 2019 'BBB'. Trinity Acquisition plc --IDR 'BBB' 'BBB-'; --4.625% senior unsecured notes due Aug. 15, 2023 'BBB'; --6.125% senior unsecured notes due Aug. 15, 2043 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

8,"  LONDON Reinsurance rates have softened in the June/July renewals season, against a backdrop of overcapacity, although the pace of the price reductions has slowed, a report by broker Willis Re on Friday showed.Reinsurers, which take on a portion of an insurer's risk and help to pay for large claims in exchange for part of the premium, have seen competition rise sharply as more funds look to compete on deals in response to low interest rates in more traditional markets.Some resinsurers have removed capacity given the low pricing, but there is no indication yet it has been enough to stabilize the market, Willis Re said in its latest 1st View Renewals report.""Capacity remains abundant and continues to overhang the market in virtually all classes and regions,"" John Cavanagh, Global CEO of Willis Re, said.  So far in 2016, just one major catastrophe loss – the Fort McMurray fires in Canada – will produce any meaningful catastrophe claims for reinsurers, he said.""Any relief that pricing may be nearing the bottom of the cycle is counterbalanced by concern over how and when rates might start to increase, even modestly, on a wider basis,"" Cavanagh said. ""The alternative is a market that faces a number of years bumping along at current levels earning very modest returns."" Willis Re is the reinsurance business of global advisory and broking company Willis Towers Watson WLTO.O.On the issue of Britain's vote to leave the European Union, Cavanagh said the industry was well-placed to cope. ""Underpinned by the strong customer-centric regulation in the UK and EU, we do not see any material risk to clients generally in terms of reinsurers' ability in the immediate future to offer continuity in the supply of reinsurance capital and consistency of approach,"" he wrote in the report.

14,"   By Jonathan Stempel  The insurance brokerage Willis Towers Watson Plc  has agreed to pay $120 million to settle litigation accusing it of helping now-imprisoned Texas financier Allen Stanford run a $7.2 billion Ponzi scheme, court papers show.The papers, in which Willis denied wrongdoing, were filed on Wednesday with the federal court in Dallas. The accord requires court approval.In a lawsuit, investors and a court-appointed receiver for Stanford's companies accused Willis of providing letters describing the insurance policies and touting the credentials of the swindler's Antigua-based Stanford International Bank. They said Willis did this with an expectation that Stanford would use the letters to lure investors into buying his bogus offshore certificates of deposit and assure them that his business was sound and their investments were safe.The settlement is the largest in 7-1/2 years of litigation brought on behalf of roughly 18,000 former Stanford investors, Edward Snyder, a lawyer for the Official Stanford Investors Committee, said in an email on Thursday. Overall settlements total well over $300 million, Snyder added. Many lawsuits remain pending.In a regulatory filing, London-based Willis said it has set aside reserves to cover its settlement.
