0,"  * Crude shipments fall nearly one-fourth compared with 4Q 2012* Decline stems from crude price decline, pipeline startupsBy Kristen HaysHOUSTON, Jan 23 Union Pacific Corp's  crude oil shipments via rail to the U.S. Gulf Coast were down 22 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier as pipeline startups increased supply in the region, a senior executive told analysts on Thursday.Narrowed discounts of U.S. crude prices to London's Brent also played a role in the decrease, Eric Butler, executive vice president of marketing and sales for the railroad, said during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. ""Crude oil spreads, growing crude supply and increased pipeline activity are expected to have a continued impact on our crude by rail volumes,"" he said.The largest publicly traded U.S. railroad network reported a 20 percent increase in quarterly profits on Thursday on higher demand for agricultural goods, autos and other industrial shipments.Crude oil shipments make up about 2 percent to 3 percent of the company's total volumes, according to Beth Whited, vice president and general manager of chemicals for Union Pacific, who spoke at an energy conference in Houston this week. Butler said pipeline startups through 2013 increased flows of West Texas and Oklahoma crude output to the Gulf Coast, reducing the need to move it via rail.In addition, the spread of Gulf Coast crude benchmark Light Louisiana Sweet (LLS), which had traded at a $1-per-barrel premium to Brent in the first three quarters of last year, fell sharply to a discount in the fourth quarter. Cheaper crude already in the region prompted a decline in rail shipments of North Dakota Bakken crude, he said. Just Wednesday, TransCanada Corp started commercial service for its long-awaited 700,000 barrel-per-day Gulf Coast pipeline, linking the bloated U.S. crude futures hub at Cushing, Oklahoma, to Texas Gulf Coast refineries. That new influx of crude could further pressure crude prices down in the Gulf Coast market.Union Pacific's network connects 23 states in the western two-thirds of the nation by rail. In addition to moving crude from North Dakota and Texas, the company's network serves oil plays in Colorado, Wyoming and Utah.Butler said Union Pacific's strategy to growing crude-by-rail volumes will focus on strengthening the sites where shipments are loaded and then unloaded, recognizing that volumes can change as crude prices fluctuate.""The various destination regions really are fundamentally going to be driven by the market and spreads,"" Butler said.",2014-01-23,UNP,"Thu Jan 23, 2014 | 2:38pm EST",UPDATE 1-Union Pacific crude shipments to US Gulf Coast down in Q4 - exec,http://www.reuters.com//article/unionpacific-crudeshipments-idUSL2N0KX11U20140123?type=companyNews

16,"  (The opinions expressed are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)By John WasikCHICAGO, July 7 As North Americans hit the highways, airports and rails for vacations this summer, it's not hard to believe that some of the most robust stocks are in the transportation industry - particularly in an improving economy. Transportation stocks have proven to be long-haul winners and essential cogs in any growth portfolio.Transportation company performance is generally a bellwether of an economy's health. When consumer and industrial demand is rising, the greater the need to ship raw materials and finished products from various points of the globe.On the retail side, a combination of higher demand and the conflict in Iraq ratcheted up U.S. gasoline prices to the highest level in six years this past Fourth of July weekend, according to the American Automobile Association. Despite the higher prices, some 35 million Americans hit the road during the holiday weekend for trips of 50 miles or more.In the wake of the 2008 financial meltdown, transportation as a sector has been a solid performer. The S&P Transportation Select Industry Index has averaged an annualized return of nearly 29 percent over the past half-decade through July 4, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. That trounces the performance of the S&P 500 Index, which posted a 19 percent return over that period, by nearly 10 percentage points.For the 12-month period that ended July 4, the transportation index has been even stronger - up nearly 44 percent, compared with about 25 percent for the broad S&P 500 Index. WHERE TO INVEST The best way to capture returns from this vibrant sector is through a passive index fund like the iShares Transportation Average ETF, which holds transportation leaders including Union Pacific Corp, FedEx Corp and United Parcel Service Inc. The ETF has its largest holdings in air freight, logistics and trucking.The iShares fund is up 36 percent for the past 12 months through July 4, compared with 24 percent for the S&P Industrials index. The fund has averaged growth of nearly 23 percent a year for the past half-decade and charges 0.46 percent in annual expenses. A smaller though less-expensive and better-performing index fund in this sector is the SPDR S&P Transportation ETF, which charges 0.35 percent annually. It is up nearly 43 percent for the 12 months through July 4. It holds a broader group of transportation companies including Avis Budget Group Inc , Delta Air Lines Inc and Con-way Inc. This ETF has a higher stake in airlines and trucking than the iShares fund.LONG-TERM SUPPORT  To understand the sector, you need to consider its separate moving parts: logistics, shipping, trucking and rail. Airlines are a big part of the retail side of the industry. And there are companies including FedEx and UPS that straddle nearly every mode of transportation.All of these companies have one thing in common - when the economy is growing, their business improves.""The valuations of many logistics companies are likely to expand on improved investor sentiment should signs emerge that the U.S. and global economies are improving,"" said Jim Corridore, head of industrial equity research for S&P Capital IQ, in a recent commentary.Although the U.S. GDP shrank by 3 percent in the first quarter due to the awful winter in two-thirds of North America, growth is expected to pick up through the rest of this year.Most pundits predict the overall economy will expand about 2 percent this year. After a strong employment report last week, analysts are even dallying with the idea of a 4 percent rise in U.S. economic growth. The market has responded heartily to this optimism, with the Dow Jones Industrials Index closing above 17,000 last Thursday. The general mood of the market will depend upon earnings growth, which many analysts predict could reach into double digits in the second half of this year.Yet don't assume that transportation is going to be a smooth ride indefinitely. The sector is particularly sensitive to oil and fuel prices. With the ongoing turmoil in Iraq - and resulting spike in oil prices - it will be a good idea to keep a close eye on this sector.

""There were some additional hazardous materials on the trains as part of the cargo, but I don't know what those products were,"" he said. ""I do know that they were not compromised in the fire."" The residents returned home and most roads, blocked during the fire, were reopened by midday on Sunday, police said.

30,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Union Pacific Corp is scrambling to cope with opposing trends across its network after a drop in freight volumes in the first quarter, the No. 1 U.S. railroad's top executive said on Thursday.Coal demand fell 5 percent in the quarter from a year earlier as utilities took advantage of low prices to burn natural gas instead. Overall freight volumes were down 2 percent, and the company reported a lower-than-expected profit on Thursday.Chief Executive Officer Lance Fritz told Reuters the railroad had struggled to deal efficiently with the ""abrupt"" fall in coal volumes.All had been rosy for Union Pacific just months earlier, in the fourth quarter. Overall freight volumes rose 6 percent, and coal, its second-largest business line, increased 9 percent as demand soared and utilities pushed to increase inventories ahead of the winter.A similar drop-off in coal has affected other railroads - CSX Corp, Norfolk Southern Corp and Kansas City Southern. CSX and Norfolk Southern also complained that a strong dollar, which makes U.S. goods less competitive in overseas markets, had affected coal exports.    Fritz said the currency situation affected some of the company's businesses, but the labor dispute at West Coast ports masked the true extent of dollar's impact.The dispute brought flows of intermodal freight to a virtual standstill late in the quarter.""We expected there would be a slowdown, but we did not anticipate volumes to go to near-zero,"" Fritz said.  Intermodal, Union Pacific's largest business line, uses standardized containers filled with consumer goods that can be hauled by ship, train and truck. Fritz said the railroad found it hard to adjust quickly to the changes in demand. It expects coal shipments to be down by a mid single-digit percentage rate in 2015, but now that the West Coast dispute is over, intermodal consumer goods shipments are picking up. ""It's hard to put a button on (adjusting the network),"" Fritz said, ""but we will continue to improve throughout the second quarter."" Analysts on Thursday said they were confident the railroad would get its network running more efficiently.""We expect Union Pacific to make adjustments to its network to preserve pricing,"" Jim Corridore of S&P Capital IQ wrote in a research note, ""and we see improvement in volumes as we move through the year.""

""Shares will be pressured on these results, but we have confidence that Union Pacific will be able to adapt resources appropriately to the volume outlook in coming quarters,"" Citi analyst Christian Wetherbee wrote in a client note, reiterating a ""buy"" rating on the stock.Low oil prices pushed Union Pacific's crude oil volumes down 39 percent. ""Intermodal"" consumer goods shipments were off 3 percent, which the railroad attributed to a labor dispute at the West Coast ports that was resolved during the quarter.""While we took actions during the quarter to adjust for the volume decline, we did not run an efficient operation,"" Chief Executive Lance Fritz said in a statement.

36,"   By Kristen Hays | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Union Pacific Corp will impose a $1,200 per-car surcharge on oil shippers that move crude in older railcars, the company told customers this week, becoming at least the second U.S. railroad to charge extra amid widespread safety concerns.In a revised tariff taking effect Aug. 1, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, the No. 1 U.S. railroad posted rates that will charge shippers more if they use so-called DOT-111 railcars, which are not as strong as cars built to a higher standard the industry adopted in October 2011.For DOT-111s carrying an average of 700 barrels of crude per car, a $1,200 surcharge would add an additional cost of $1.71 per barrel shipped.Union Pacific said it changed its tariff in response to stronger U.S. rules for handling flammable liquids that were recently announced after a string of fiery crashes.Oil by rail proliferated in tandem with the U.S. shale oil boom. Coastal refiners, in particular, used rail to tap cheaper domestic crudes and buy fewer costly imports. However, U.S. oil by rail shipments have dipped from more than 1 million barrels per day in the fourth quarter 2014 to 850,000 bpd in April, U.S. government data shows, as crude prices fell during a global oil glut. Berkshire Hathaway Inc-owned BNSF Railway in January imposed a similar $1,000 per DOT-111 surcharge on shippers. In March, the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, which represents refiners and petrochemical companies, sued BNSF, alleging the surcharge violates the railway's obligation to transport hazardous materials such as crude under U.S. regulations. BNSF countered that it did not refuse to accommodate DOT-111s, and AFPM's complaint centers on whether the surcharge is reasonable.In May, the U.S. Department of Transportation unveiled new standards for crude and ethanol railcars, requiring more reinforcements than the CPC-1232 industry model adopted in 2011. The government's standard now requires all new crude railcars built from October 2015 on to have 9/16-inch thick hulls, increased reinforcements for valves where oil enters the car at the top and drains out the bottom, and full-height steel shields on the front and back.CPC-1232s, which make up the vast bulk of new fleets bought and leased by U.S. refiners since 2012, are less fortified with 7/16-inch thick steel.The new DOT standards included a schedule to retrofit both DOT-111s and CPC-1232s to strengthen them.

38,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Union Pacific Corp (UNP.N), a railroad contending with declining coal, energy-related and agricultural freight volumes, sees some signs that consumer demand for cars and other big-ticket items will help boost business, its top executive said on Thursday.""I'm optimistic they (consumers) will show up, but they have yet to take up the slack,"" Chief Executive Officer Lance Fritz told Reuters. Earlier on Thursday, Omaha, Nebraska-based Union Pacific, the largest U.S. railroad, reported a lower second-quarter profit, hurt by a 26 percent decline in coal shipments.Lower coal freight volumes have affected all of the major U.S. railroads as power plants have shifted more to burning cheap natural gas.  Coal exports have also suffered from the strong U.S. dollar, which has made the fuel less competitive against foreign coal producers.    Fritz said second-half coal volumes should remain lower than a year earlier. Union Pacific has about 1,200 engineers and conductors on furlough as the company works to cut costs. With no immediate end in sight to the commodity woes for the railroads, Fritz said U.S. consumers have given hopeful yet mixed signals that a long-awaited, meaningful economic recovery is within reach. He pointed to robust car sales and fairly strong consumer confidence as encouraging signs that Americans are ready to spend. During the second quarter, automotive shipments rose 7 percent. Intermodal shipments, which consist of standardized containers carrying consumer goods that can be hauled by ship, truck or train, also provided some relief, increasing 2 percent.  But Fritz said lackluster housing starts made it harder to gauge the mindset of the U.S. consumer.""U.S. consumers are showing up in some places and not in others,"" Fritz said.

42,"   By Nick Carey and Sinead Carew | CHICAGO/NEW YORK  CHICAGO/NEW YORK Investors in U.S. railroad stocks, who have been punished in 2015 by an accelerating decline in high-margin coal shipments, now are pinning their long-term hopes on a resurgence in consumer spending.Their bet is that a strengthening economy will produce enough demand that railroads will be able to replace the income lost to years of declining coal use with so-called intermodal shipping - the movement of containers stuffed with clothing, furniture and other consumer goods.    Thanks to environmental rules regulating power plant emissions, coal use has declined steadily since peaking in 2008.So far this year, freight volumes have tumbled 9.2 percent as low energy prices encouraged utilities to switch to burning cheaper natural gas, while the strong U.S. dollar has hurt exports. The accelerated decline this year has highlighted expectations that barring regulatory changes, railroads’ revenue from coal should continue to decline. Railroad shares have plunged as a result. The Dow Jones U.S. Railroads index has pulled back 27.9 percent this year after rising 39.7 percent in 2013 and 28.9 percent in 2014. The railroads' decline has contributed to a 14-percent year-to-date decline for the broader Dow Jones transportation average. The major publicly-traded U.S. railroads including Union Pacific Corp, CSX Corp and Norfolk Southern Corp have missed estimates or trimmed earnings forecasts, furloughed workers and parked equipment, largely as a result of the coal downturn. “All that coal is not coming back,” said Morningstar analyst Keith Schoonmaker. “The question is how much (consumer goods) can mitigate those declines.” It is an open question. Intermodal freight volumes are more than double coal and make up 47 percent of total rail traffic, according to the American Association of Railroads, but that is a low-margin business where revenue per carload is often half or less than coal.And though intermodal shipments have risen more than 17 percent since 2008, the moderate 3.1 percent increase in intermodal freight shipments so far this year has not been nearly enough to offset coal revenue declines.If the economy and consumer spending hit a consistent stride in 2016, that would lift intermodal shipments - perhaps enough to beat 2015 volumes. But with consumer spending on goods and services expected to rise just 2.8 percent in 2016, according to the Congressional Budget Office, it will likely take years to offset coal’s decline.""If economic growth can pick up, the rails will look like a bargain,"" said BB&T Capital Markets analyst Mark Levin. Wall Street consensus shows aggregate earnings returning to more than 9-percent growth in the first half of 2016, according to Thomson Reuters data. But part of that improvement will likely be because of a comparison with weak 2015 numbers. The group is seen posting an earnings decline of 8.3 percent in the third quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data.The 2016 earnings estimates may need to come down. Macquarie Research analyst Cleo Zagrean says, ""the commodity environment remains bleak"" and U.S. utilities may switch to natural gas at a faster pace than investors expect in coming years. COAL BURNOUT All of the major publicly traded U.S. railroads have experienced double-digit declines in coal shipments and revenues since 2008. CSX, the most exposed with 21 percent of second quarter revenue coming from coal shipments, has seen coal shipments decline 30 percent since 2008. Its share price has fallen 26.8 percent this year. Norfolk Southern's coal carloads have fallen and 28 percent while Union Pacific coal carloads have fallen nearly 25 percent in the same time frame.

47,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Facing a freight recession caused by slumping commodity prices and industrial output, No. 1 U.S. railroad Union Pacific Corp (UNP.N) said Thursday hopes of strong economic growth have so far been undermined by a key missing ingredient - the American consumer.""What's causing us some concern is it’s hard to figure out where the consumer is at,"" Chief Executive Lance Fritz told Reuters by phone. While Americans were buying automobiles and unemployment numbers looked good, he said labor participation ""is lackluster and consumers just don’t seem to be showing up to purchase goods and services.""Ever since oil prices began to decline in 2014, economists and corporate America have hoped this would translate into higher consumption.""There was a widespread belief that consumers would turn the savings from low fuel into spending and we haven’t seen that so much,"" Fritz said. The chief executive spoke to Reuters after the Omaha, Nebraska-based railroad company reported a lower fourth-quarter profit amid declining freight volumes affecting coal, steel, industrial goods and agricultural products, that reflected a broad-based commodity slump. The one bright spot was automotive shipments, as consumer goods also took a dive.Shares were down 3.5 percent at $71 in afternoon trading. Just this week, Moody's Investors Service warned of ""increasing risks of an industrial recession"" for North American manufacturers.  Fritz said feedback from the railroad's customers ""depends on what part of the economy they're competing in.""""Those that have an exposure to global trade and the strong dollar are a little pessimistic in terms of the steel industry and capacity utilization in U.S. plants,"" he said. ""The automobile makers are cautious but also somewhat optimistic, they've gone on a tear here for four or five years and consumers look like they're pretty bullish on automobiles."" Coal's decline has hurt North America's railroads, with shipments falling nearly 12 percent in 2015 as utilities switched to cheaper natural gas and as a sturdy U.S. dollar hurt coal exports.Union Pacific expects coal to be down around 20 percent in the first quarter of this year, but beyond that, the outlook is more uncertain.""It’s going to be all about how quickly the electricity generators chew through their excess inventory,"" and what happens with the weather and natural gas prices, Fritz said.

The company said freight volumes dropped 9 percent during the fourth quarter, amid what industry executives have said is a ""freight recession"" for North American railroads.Last week, the No. 3 U.S. railroad CSX Corp reported a lower profit, and said a weak global economy and U.S. industrial markets would impact its 2016 results. Coal volumes plunged 22 percent during the quarter, continuing a downtrend trend afflicting the industry as utilities switch to burning cheaper natural gas and as a strong U.S. dollar hurts exports. Industrial products fell 16 percent in the quarter. Just this week, Moody's Investors Service warned of ""increasing risks of an industrial recession"" for North American manufacturers. Union Pacific agricultural product volumes dropped 5 percent, reflecting an ongoing slump affecting farmers. Intermodal freight volumes, or shipments of consumer goods by container, fell 7 percent. The lone bright spot was automotive shipments, reflecting continued strong vehicle sales, which grew 8 percent.Although earnings were down, the railroad reported a healthy operating ratio, a key metric for analysts and investors, of 63.2 percent. This was due to efforts to reduce costs, as the railroad has furloughed 3,900 workers and put 1,400 locomotives in storage, as well as price increases for hauling freight. Union Pacific reported a quarterly net income of $1.1 billion, or $1.31 per share, down more than 21 percent from $1.4 billion, or $1.61 per share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected earnings per share for the quarter of $1.42.The company earned revenue of $5.2 billion, down more than 15 percent from $6.15 billion a year earlier.

49,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Union Pacific Corp reported a lower quarterly profit on Thursday as slumping commodities prices and ailing industrial production hurt freight volumes, and the No. 1 U.S. railroad warned 2016 does not look much better for its business.The news sent the Omaha, Nebraska-based company's shares down more than 7 percent to $68.20 in early trading.""Overall economic conditions, uncertainty in the energy markets, commodity prices, and the strength of the U.S. dollar will continue to have a major impact on our business this year,"" Chief Executive Lance Fritz said in a statement.Executives said on a conference call with analysts they could not provide an earnings forecast for 2016 because of uncertainty in Union Pacific's markets.  The company said freight volumes dropped 9 percent during the fourth quarter, amid what industry executives have said is a ""freight recession"" for North American railroads.Last week, the No. 3 U.S. railroad CSX Corp reported a lower profit, and said a weak global economy and U.S. industrial markets would impact its 2016 results. Coal volumes plunged 22 percent during the quarter, continuing a downtrend trend afflicting the industry as utilities switch to burning cheaper natural gas and as a strong U.S. dollar hurts exports. Industrial products fell 16 percent in the quarter. Just this week, Moody's Investors Service warned of ""increasing risks of an industrial recession"" for North American manufacturers. Union Pacific agricultural product volumes dropped 5 percent, reflecting an ongoing slump affecting farmers. Intermodal freight volumes, or shipments of consumer goods by container, fell 7 percent. The lone bright spot was automotive shipments, reflecting continued strong vehicle sales, which grew 8 percent.Although earnings were down, the railroad reported a healthy operating ratio, a key metric for analysts and investors, of 63.2 percent. This was due to efforts to reduce costs, as the railroad has furloughed 3,900 workers and put 1,400 locomotives in storage, as well as price increases for hauling freight. Union Pacific reported a quarterly net income of $1.1 billion, or $1.31 per share, down more than 21 percent from $1.4 billion, or $1.61 per share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected earnings per share for the quarter of $1.42.The company earned revenue of $5.2 billion, down more than 15 percent from $6.15 billion a year earlier.

58,"   By Eric M. Johnson  A Union Pacific train carrying crude oil derailed and burst into flames along Oregon's scenic Columbia River gorge on Friday in the first major rail accident involving crude in a year.While no injuries were reported, the train remained engulfed in flames six hours after the derailment, officials said. The accident has already renewed calls for stronger regulation to guard communities against crude-by-rail accidents.Union Pacific Corp, owner of the line, said 11 rail cars from a 96-car train carrying crude oil derailed about 70 miles (110 km) east of Portland, near the tiny town of Mosier. Oil spilled from one car, but multiple cars of Bakken crude caught fire, said Oregon Department of Transportation spokesman Tom Fuller. Firefighters were still fighting the flames several hours later.The crude was bought by TrailStone Inc's U.S. Oil & Refining Co and bound for its refinery in Tacoma, Washington, some 200 miles (322 km) northwest of the derailment, the company said.Television footage showed smoke and flames along with overturned black tanker cars snaking across the tracks, which weave through the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area. ""I looked outside and there was black and white smoke blowing across the sky, and I could hear the flames,"" said Mosier resident Dan Hoffman, 32, whose house is about 100 meters (328 ft) from the derailment. ""A sheriff's official in an SUV told me to get the hell out.""While rail shipments have dipped from more than 1 million barrels per day in 2014 as a result of the lengthy slump in oil prices, the first such crash in a year will likely reignite the debate over safety concerns surrounding transporting crude by rail.""Seeing our beautiful Columbia River Gorge on fire today should be a wake-up call for federal and state agencies – underscoring the need to complete comprehensive environmental reviews of oil-by-rail in the Pacific Northwest,"" said U.S. Representative Earl Blumenauer of Oregon. Ecology officials from Washington state said there was no sign of oil in the Columbia River or Rock Creek. SAFETY MEASURES DELAYED Since 2008, there have been at least 10 major oil-train derailments across the United States and Canada, including a disaster that killed 47 people in a Quebec town in July 2013.The incident comes eight months after lawmakers extended a deadline until the end of 2018 for rail operators to implement advanced safety technology, known as positive train control, or PTC, which safety experts say can avoid derailments and other major accidents.  The measures included phasing out older tank cars, adding electronic braking systems and imposing speed limits, all meant to reduce the frequency and severity of oil train crashes.The tank cars involved in Friday's crash were CPC-1232 models, which elected officials have raised concerns about in the past even though they are an upgrade from older models considered less safe. On Friday, U.S. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon repeated his call from last year for federal officials to look into whether the newer cars were safe enough.""It's clear with this crash - as it has been for years -  that more must be done to protect our communities,"" Wyden said.Rail operators such as Union Pacific are required under federal law to disclose crude rail movements to state officials to help prepare for emergencies.

Like other major U.S. railroads, Union Pacific has suffered from a precipitous drop in coal freight. Low fuel prices have encouraged utilities to burn cheaper natural gas instead, while the strong dollar has hurt coal exports.U.S. railroads have reacted to falling demand by furloughing workers and mothballing locomotives. Union Pacific's hourly workforce numbered 13,760 in the second quarter, about 22 percent lower than the same period in 2015. The company also has 14 percent fewer locomotives in service compared with the 2015 quarter. Union Pacific's revenues declined across all its businesses versus the year-ago period. Even revenue in its automotive business, which for several years has performed well in tandem with strong U.S. automaker sales, dropped 13 percent during the quarter.

61,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Full-year 2016 freight volumes at Union Pacific Corp (UNP.N) could fall between 6 percent and 8 percent from 2015, driven by declining coal volumes, weak shale oil business and the strong U.S. dollar, the company's top executive said on Thursday.Chief Executive Lance Fritz told Reuters a ""not very robust"" showing by U.S. consumers would also hurt freight. Previously the company has said it expected freight volumes for the year to be down in the ""mid-single digits."" Fritz spoke to Reuters after the Omaha, Nebraska-based railroad reported a lower second-quarter profit that met analyst expectations.Like the other major U.S. railroads, Union Pacific has been struggling to manage a major decline in coal freight volumes as utilities have switched to burning cheaper natural gas and the strong U.S. dollar has weighed on coal exports.Fritz said the decline in coal has been partially offset recently by rising natural gas prices and a hot summer, where demand for electricity spikes with the use of power-hungry air conditioning units.  ""There are probably opportunities for coal to grow in (power) generation,"" he said. ""We just to don't see it growing back to where it used to be."" Fritz said as a result the company is looking for new markets and is growing its business outside of coal. As an example, he said Union Pacific has been focusing on growing its cross-border business hauling finished vehicles and auto parts between the United States and Mexico.He said U.S. consumers may not be spending more for a number of reasons. ""There's plenty for consumers to be concerned about,"" he said, ""whether it's the global economy, terrorism, some of the acts of violence that they see randomly occurring.""""Even the Great Recession is not too distant in a lot of people's memories,"" he added. ""So I think all of that could be creating cautious behavior."" Some U.S. business leaders say the best opportunity for Congress to pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership, one of the world's biggest multinational trade deals, will be during the lame-duck session after the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8. But Fritz said he was not so sure.""It's a really hard call,"" he said. ""It's very difficult to move anything in a lame duck session... but we'd like to see that and we'd really encourage that.""

Union Pacific's hourly workforce numbered 13,760 in the second quarter, about 22 percent lower than the same period in 2015. The company also has 14 percent fewer locomotives in service compared with the 2015 quarter. Union Pacific's revenues declined across all its businesses versus the year-ago period. Even revenue in its automotive business, which for several years has performed well in tandem with strong U.S. automaker sales, dropped 13 percent during the quarter. Chief Executive Lance Fritz told Reuters the company expects full-year 2016 freight volumes to be down between 6 percent to 8 percent, driven by declining coal, weakness in the shale oil industry and the strong U.S. dollar.A ""not-very-robust"" showing by U.S. consumers would also weigh on freight, he added.In afternoon trading, Union Pacific shares were down 3.1 percent at $91.15.

63,"  (Adds comments on coal, consumers, TPP, paragraphs 3-13)By Nick CareyCHICAGO, July 21 Full-year 2016 freight volumes at Union Pacific Corp could fall between 6 percent and 8 percent from 2015, driven by declining coal volumes, weak shale oil business and the strong U.S. dollar, the company's top executive said on Thursday.Chief Executive Lance Fritz told Reuters a ""not very robust"" showing by U.S. consumers would also hurt freight. Previously the company has said it expected freight volumes for the year to be down in the ""mid-single digits.""Fritz spoke to Reuters after the Omaha, Nebraska-based railroad reported a lower second-quarter profit that met analyst expectations.Like the other major U.S. railroads, Union Pacific has been struggling to manage a major decline in coal freight volumes as utilities have switched to burning cheaper natural gas and the strong U.S. dollar has weighed on coal exports. Fritz said the decline in coal has been partially offset recently by rising natural gas prices and a hot summer, where demand for electricity spikes with the use of power-hungry air conditioning units.""There are probably opportunities for coal to grow in (power) generation,"" he said. ""We just to don't see it growing back to where it used to be."" Fritz said as a result the company is looking for new markets and is growing its business outside of coal. As an example, he said Union Pacific has been focusing on growing its cross-border business hauling finished vehicles and auto parts between the United States and Mexico.He said U.S. consumers may not be spending more for a number of reasons.""There's plenty for consumers to be concerned about,"" he said, ""whether it's the global economy, terrorism, some of the acts of violence that they see randomly occurring."" ""Even the Great Recession is not too distant in a lot of people's memories,"" he added. ""So I think all of that could be creating cautious behavior.""Some U.S. business leaders say the best opportunity for Congress to pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership, one of the world's biggest multinational trade deals, will be during the lame-duck session after the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8.But Fritz said he was not so sure.""It's a really hard call,"" he said. ""It's very difficult to move anything in a lame duck session... but we'd like to see that and we'd really encourage that.""

72,"   By Nick Carey | DETROIT  DETROIT The top executive of railroad Union Pacific Corp said on Thursday that despite negative election campaign rhetoric about free trade agreements, they have benefited the U.S. economy and he is optimistic Congress will pass the Trans Pacific Partnership.""If our lawmakers and our administration put the right glasses on and see TPP for what it is, there's a chance that it would be picked up and passed,"" Lance Fritz, chief executive of the largest U.S. railway, told Reuters. ""I'm pushing for that and I hope for it.""Both major party nominees in the U.S. presidential race - Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump - have criticized TPP, a sweeping pan-Pacific trade deal covering 12 countries negotiated by the Obama administration.Trump also has railed against the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico as a U.S. job killer, saying that if elected, he would be prepared to scrap it if he could not negotiate much better terms for the United States.""We've heard candidates bashing NAFTA as ineffective or a failure,"" Fritz said. ""Nothing could be further from the truth."" Fritz said that since NAFTA went into effect in 1994, U.S. exports to Mexico have increased more than 400 percent and today's U.S. economy is ""built on free trade.""""For our lifestyle to be what it is at the price point that it is, we have to have free trade,"" he said. Fritz spoke to Reuters after the company posted a worse-than-expected third-quarter net profit due to a 6 percent decline in freight volumes, lead by a steep drop in coal. Coal used to account for as much as to 50 percent of U.S. electricity generation, but that figure has dropped sharply as utilities have switched to burning cheaper and cleaner natural gas. Moving forward Fritz said the railroad sees that level hovering around 30 percent. Omaha, Nebraska-based Union Pacific sees other growth opportunities, including increasing cross-border trade with Mexico as it serves all six rail gateways between the two countries and strong chemical industry output on the Gulf Coast, Fritz said.  Fritz said that while the housing market is still relatively depressed compared to prior to the Great Recession, as improves ""we will participate in it.""Union Pacific's CEO also said that after years of lackluster retail sales, consumers are likely to start spending more soon.""The U.S. consumer has been relatively conservative in their spending habits for many reasons and I don't think that can last forever,"" he said.
