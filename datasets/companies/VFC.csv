Gross margins fell 10 basis points to 48.4 percent in the second quarter ended June 28, hurt by unfavorable foreign exchange rates and the company's efforts to lower its jeanswear inventories.The gross margin decline was ""a disappointment"", Credit Suisse analyst Christian Buss wrote in a note.""We had expected accelerated investments in international markets as well as owned retail to support margins,"" he said.Buss had expected second-quarter gross margins of 49.4 percent - the same figure the company reported in the previous quarter. VF Corp said it expects gross margins to return to historical levels of about 49 percent as it shifts focus away from jeanswear - a category that saw low demand.The company, which also owns the Lee and Wrangler brands, said jeans sales fell 1 percent, primarily in the Lee brand, as fewer women shopped for denim clothes in the quarter.The company's rivals are also struggling in the volatile North American retail environment as stagnant wage growth and rising taxes force consumers to keep a lid on discretionary spending.Gap Inc said last week that sales at stores open at least a year fell 2 percent in June, hurt by declines at its Gap and Banana Republic brands. VF Corp's net profit rose to $157.7 million, or 36 cents per share, in the quarter, from $138.3 million, or 31 cents per share a year ago.Total revenue rose 8 percent to $2.40 billion.Analysts on average had estimated a profit of 35 cents per share on revenue of $2.36 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company expects full-year earnings of $3.06 per share, compared with Wall Street's estimate of $3.09 per share.Sales in its outdoor and action sports business rose 16 percent to $1.27 billion, accounting for more than half its total revenue.Shares of Greensboro, North Carolina-based VF Corp were down 1.2 percent at $60.89 at 14:30 ET on the New York Stock Exchange.(Editing by Simon Jennings)",2014-07-18,VFC,"Fri Jul 18, 2014 | 2:33pm EDT","UPDATE 2-VF Corp 2nd-qtr profit beats, but forecast misses Street",http://www.reuters.com//article/vf-results-idUSL4N0PT3HO20140718?type=companyNews

4,"  (Adds input from Vanity Fair, Instyle)By Piya Sinha-RoyLOS ANGELES, Sept 30 With the help of Oscar de la Renta, Stella McCartney, Giambattista Valli and Dolce & Gabbana, human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin vaulted into the top echelons of Hollywood fashion with her stylish Italian wedding to actor George Clooney.Alamuddin, 36, showcased several outfits during her whirlwind wedding weekend in Venice, picking British, American and Italian designers and channeling golden age Hollywood glamour.The piece de resistance was an off-the-shoulder tulle and Chantilly lace gown she wore at her formal wedding ceremony on Saturday that was revealed on Tuesday by fashion magazine Vogue and custom-made by New York-based de la Renta.The British-Lebanese bride told Vogue she and Clooney wanted a ""romantic and elegant"" wedding, and de la Renta's romantic and feminine design was the right choice. The magazine renowned for anointing fashion royalty and whose editor Anna Wintour attended the nuptials, noted ""she stands resplendent in her dress.""De la Renta also supplied Alamuddin's post-wedding dress, which the magazine described as a ""festive, Gatsby-style party frock."" Clooney wore a custom black tuxedo by Giorgio Armani.Oscar-winning Clooney, 53, one of Hollywood's most famous bachelors, and Alamuddin's wedding was attended by celebrities such as Cindy Crawford, Bill Murray and Matt Damon. It has drawn comparisons to the nuptials of Kate Middleton and Britain's Prince William in April 2011. Middleton, now the Duchess of Cambridge, has become a style icon for her chic ensembles that often incorporate high fashion and high street retail, earning a place in Vanity Fair's annual best dressed lists over the past few years.Vanity Fair's special correspondent, Amy Fine Collins, said Alamuddin was one of the runners up for the magazine's Best Dressed list this year, and pegged her as one to watch during the upcoming year for her ""cosmopolitan view of fashion.""""Amal has immediately entered the major leagues,"" Collins said. ""She has her own innate style which comes with maturity and intelligence."" The raven-haired beauty opted for a chic white trouser and top by British designer Stella McCartney for her civil wedding ceremony on Monday. The outfit drew on effortless coastal fashion, a theme she embraced as she arrived in Venice in a black and white maxi Dolce & Gabbana dress.As the newlyweds jetted through Venice in a speedboat named 'Amore,' the new Mrs Clooney selected a short, bell-skirted dress embroidered with floral motifs by Italian designer Giambattista Valli, showcasing her long legs.""She executed a very polished overall look that a lot of women can aspire to and emulate,"" said Dana Avidan-Cohn, senior market editor at InStyle magazine.""Everything was elegant and well-suited for the affairs she was going to, and that's what makes such a stylish person.""Alamuddin also opted for a blood red Alexander McQueen gown with a dramatic train for her pre-wedding rehearsal dinner. Avidan-Cohn said the lawyer paid homage to her own beliefs and profession by carrying a clutch by Sarah's Bag, a Beirut-based project where incarcerated women make artisan handbags and receive profits.

Conde Nast Entertainment (CNE), the publisher's film, television and video division, will unveil two original virtual reality series for the upcoming year at its Tuesday presentation before advertisers at the Newfronts, an annual digital content showcase in New York. While the company is keeping tight-lipped on the details of the shows it will produce with virtual reality company Jaunt VR, one of which will be in a narrative reality format, it is the first major publisher to use the technology for serialized storytelling.""We're speaking to some very impressive film makers to partner with us on this venture,"" said Dawn Ostroff, president of CNE. ""The virtual reality space not only will allow the viewer to become more engaged, it'll make them more immersed."" Print publishers have been ramping up their online video content in an attempt to draw digital consumers to their brands and revive interest from advertisers. Conde Nast's digital audience has now surpassed its print audience, the company said.The two series will air on CNE's The Scene, launched a year ago and home to 2,500 original videos created in 2014 by Conde Nast's brands as well as partners such as ABC News and Buzzfeed.
