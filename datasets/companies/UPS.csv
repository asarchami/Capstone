0,"   By Nivedita Bhattacharjee and Sagarika Jaisinghani  United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) said on Friday its fourth-quarter earnings will fall well short of market estimates due to a surge in online shopping just before Christmas that caught the company off guard and led to late deliveries and higher costs.Typically, a rise in online sales is good news for companies such as UPS and competitor FedEx Corp (FDX.N) because it translates into brisker demand. But UPS said it had been overwhelmed by the volume of holiday packages, delaying the arrival of Christmas presents around the globe and spurring angry customers to take to social websites to complain.UPS said it delivered more than 31 million packages on December 23, the most in its history. Moreover, that highest-volume delivery day came six days later than the company had expected and volume was 7.5 percent higher than it had planned for.That, coupled with ice storms and heavy snow that snarled roads and airports [ID:nL6N0K1049], added to shipping bottlenecks.UPS did not say how many packages were delayed, but said it had to hire 30,000 extra workers to try to get all the parcels delivered on time. That was more than 50 percent more temporary staff than it had planned to hire. Extra equipment was also used to try to get gifts delivered on time.The world's No. 1 package delivery company's shares fell as much as 3.5 percent early on Friday before retracing some of that loss later in the day.While U.S. retailers and shipping companies were aware the 2013 holiday-shopping season would be shorter - there were six fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas - many were overwhelmed by the change in customer buying patterns. Yvonne Roeske, for instance, owner of a home furnishing store in Park Ridge, Illinois, who uses UPS ground shipping, said she did not see a 25 percent rise in online volume coming.She said that due to their experience with Amazon.com (AMZN.O), shoppers are getting more comfortable waiting until the last minute before making online purchases and still getting delivery in one or two days.This past season, shoppers got direct mail from Amazon guaranteeing Christmas Day delivery on orders placed as late as December 22. But while bigger shippers like Amazon are able to fulfill last-minute demands, many others cannot. A ""GOOD"" MISS: UPS estimated fourth-quarter diluted earnings of $1.25 per share, well short of the $1.43 per share expected by Wall Street, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company estimated full-year earnings of $4.57 per share, below its previous forecast of $4.65-$4.85.

Like Hartford, most analysts on Wall Street said that though UPS's fourth quarter will be affected, the jump in traffic bodes well for the company's future, especially since UPS said it was confident in its 2014 outlook.UPS said it expects full-year diluted earnings to rise by 10-15 percent this year, implying a profit of $5.02-$5.26 per share. Analysts had expected $5.48.""This glitch causes short-term costs like overtime and extra employees, but shows really strong online fulfillment demand.

As a result, the law firm, which was also unidentified, released $4.9 million of the funds, which was to be used toward the purchase of the men's magazine company, the complaint said.A second lender provided $3 million on the belief its loan was secured by the same stock after also receiving a bogus account statement, according to charging documents.Darden attempted to get $20 million from a third lender, which by December 2013 had agreed to be involved in the possible transaction as long as a cable channel was created based on Maxim's content, the complaint said.Darden, from the New York City borough of Staten Island, also tricked a Taiwanese company into paying him $500,000 after falsely claiming he would arrange an exhibition match by the New York Knicks basketball team, authorities said.

11,"  (Corrects to say in paragraph 18 that Darden surrendered to the Secret Service, not the FBI)By Nate RaymondNEW YORK Feb 13 U.S. prosecutors on Thursday charged the son of a former United Parcel Service Inc executive with impersonating his father to fraudulently obtain millions of dollars that was intended to finance the purchase of Maxim magazine last year.Calvin Darden Jr., 39, faces two counts of wire fraud for his role in an elaborate scheme involving fake emails and bank statements to obtain more than $8 million and attempt to secure another $20 million, the prosecutors said.Darden was arrested Wednesday after what a prosecutor described as a manhunt. He is the son of Calvin Darden Sr., a former vice president of U.S. operations at UPS.A lawyer for Darden, Xavier Donaldson, declined to comment. His father did not respond to requests for comment.In September, Alpha Media Group Inc, which is partially owned by Cerberus Capital Management, announced an agreement to sell Maxim to Darden Media Group, a company headed by Calvin Darden Sr. It was unclear from court documents whether Darden Jr. was involved in that deal, which did not go through.According to a criminal complaint, the younger Darden last year provided a fake bank account statement to an unidentified lender that showed stock holdings by his father in at least three companies for which the senior Darden served as a director.Darden's father serves on the board of directors of Target Corp, Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc and Cardinal Health Inc. After the lender put $5.5 million in escrow, Darden sent a fake email to the law firm holding the money authorizing the release of the funds, according to the complaint.As a result, the law firm, which was also unidentified, released $4.9 million of the funds, which was to be used toward the purchase of the men's magazine company, the complaint said.A second lender provided $3 million on the belief its loan was secured by the same stock after also receiving a bogus account statement, according to charging documents.Darden attempted to get $20 million from a third lender, which by December 2013 had agreed to be involved in the possible transaction as long as a cable channel was created based on Maxim's content, the complaint said. Darden, from the New York City borough of Staten Island, also tricked a Taiwanese company into paying him $500,000 after falsely claiming he would arrange an exhibition match by the New York Knicks basketball team, authorities said.""Everyone deserves the right to make an honest living, but not by lying, cheating, or at the expense of others,"" FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge George Venizelos said in a statement.James Pastore, an assistant U.S. attorney, called the case ""an audacious fraud. A search of Darden's home uncovered documents that appeared related to ""other similar frauds,"" he added.""We have the possibility of more victims,"" Pastore said. U.S. Magistrate Judge Andrew Peck set bail at $1 million and ordered home detention. Prosecutors had argued that Darden should be held in jail as a flight risk and danger to the community.Pastore said that Darden led federal agents on a manhunt on Wednesday, a day after authorities contacted his wife.Darden wasn't at home when federal agents went to arrest him shortly after 6 a.m., then lied by claiming he was in Long Island when he was in a New Jersey hotel, Pastore said.Agents who arrived at the hotel found Darden's car abandoned, Pastore said. Darden later surrendered to the Secret Service.Darden faces a maximum of 40 years in prison if convicted.This is not the first time Darden has faced criminal charges. In 2005, the former stock broker pleaded guilty to New York state charges that he stole almost $6 million from 11 people.Darden was sentenced to four to 12 years in prison. He was released in September 2008 and returned to jail in August 2010 for less than two months due to a parole violation, a spokeswoman for the New York State Department of Corrections said.

12,"  * Biggest purchase yet of propane vehicles* U.S. propane output at all-time high* Concerns have arisen about propane supply networkMarch 5 United Parcel Service Inc is spending $70 million to add 1,000 propane trucks to its delivery fleet, the biggest bulk purchase of propane-fired vehicles yet as output of the fuel in the United States hits record highs.The fleet, which UPS is buying from Daimler AG's  Freightliner Custom Chassis Corp, will replace gasoline and diesel vehicles in Louisiana and Oklahoma, UPS said in a statement on Wednesday. The investment will include 50 new fueling stations.The transition is expected to begin in the middle of this year and be completed early next year, UPS said. It also plans to introduce propane-fueled vehicles in other U.S. states. The fleet, which adds to 900 propane trucks the courier company already runs in Canada, is expected to displace about 3.5 million gallons of gasoline and diesel per year, UPS said.UPS, known for its brown delivery trucks, already has a fleet of about 3,150 alternative-fuel vehicles running on compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, biomethane and electricity. Propane is ""a clean-burning fuel that lowers operating costs and is readily accessible, especially on rural routes in the United States,"" said UPS Chief Operating Officer David Abney.Output of propane, which is produced alongside oil and gas and is traditionally used for heating, it at all-time highs in the United States thanks to a drilling boom. Propane is on average between $1.25 and $1.50 per gallon cheaper than gasoline at the pump, a UPS spokeswoman said.The cheap abundance has made propane a viable alternative to gasoline in recent years, rivaling natural gas and other niche fuels. There are currently about 200,000 propane-powered vehicles on U.S. roads. Last year, Home Satellite TV provider DISH Network Corp signed a deal to run 200 of its trucks on propane. Despite higher output, however, the delivery network came under severe strain as cold weather drove heating demand higher this winter. Propane suppliers struggled to deliver enough fuel to millions of homes and businesses leading to supply rationing which caused prices to spike higher. A lack of pipelines led to an over reliance on trucks and trains to ship the fuel amid some of the coldest weather in decades""We have identified some improvements that can be made in our infrastructure,"" said Roy Willis, president of the nonprofit Propane Education and Research Council, which expects 244,000 propane vehicles in the United States by 2020.""But this (UPS deal) is a good sign of confidence that the challenges we experienced this winter were a short-term, weather-driven phenomenon.""",2014-03-05,UPS,"Wed Mar 5, 2014 | 12:49pm EST","UPDATE 2-UPS to buy 1,000 propane-fueled delivery trucks for U.S. fleet",http://www.reuters.com//article/ups-fleet-propane-idUSL3N0M240720140305?type=companyNews

Deutsche Post has said customer response to the parcel boxes, which it started setting up earlier this year, were positive as books, electronic gadgets and other goods ordered from Amazon and other online retailers could easily be delivered right to their doorsteps.

28,"  (The opinions expressed are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)By John WasikCHICAGO, July 7 As North Americans hit the highways, airports and rails for vacations this summer, it's not hard to believe that some of the most robust stocks are in the transportation industry - particularly in an improving economy. Transportation stocks have proven to be long-haul winners and essential cogs in any growth portfolio.Transportation company performance is generally a bellwether of an economy's health. When consumer and industrial demand is rising, the greater the need to ship raw materials and finished products from various points of the globe.On the retail side, a combination of higher demand and the conflict in Iraq ratcheted up U.S. gasoline prices to the highest level in six years this past Fourth of July weekend, according to the American Automobile Association. Despite the higher prices, some 35 million Americans hit the road during the holiday weekend for trips of 50 miles or more.In the wake of the 2008 financial meltdown, transportation as a sector has been a solid performer. The S&P Transportation Select Industry Index has averaged an annualized return of nearly 29 percent over the past half-decade through July 4, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. That trounces the performance of the S&P 500 Index, which posted a 19 percent return over that period, by nearly 10 percentage points.For the 12-month period that ended July 4, the transportation index has been even stronger - up nearly 44 percent, compared with about 25 percent for the broad S&P 500 Index. WHERE TO INVEST The best way to capture returns from this vibrant sector is through a passive index fund like the iShares Transportation Average ETF, which holds transportation leaders including Union Pacific Corp, FedEx Corp and United Parcel Service Inc. The ETF has its largest holdings in air freight, logistics and trucking.The iShares fund is up 36 percent for the past 12 months through July 4, compared with 24 percent for the S&P Industrials index. The fund has averaged growth of nearly 23 percent a year for the past half-decade and charges 0.46 percent in annual expenses. A smaller though less-expensive and better-performing index fund in this sector is the SPDR S&P Transportation ETF, which charges 0.35 percent annually. It is up nearly 43 percent for the 12 months through July 4. It holds a broader group of transportation companies including Avis Budget Group Inc , Delta Air Lines Inc and Con-way Inc. This ETF has a higher stake in airlines and trucking than the iShares fund.LONG-TERM SUPPORT  To understand the sector, you need to consider its separate moving parts: logistics, shipping, trucking and rail. Airlines are a big part of the retail side of the industry. And there are companies including FedEx and UPS that straddle nearly every mode of transportation.All of these companies have one thing in common - when the economy is growing, their business improves.""The valuations of many logistics companies are likely to expand on improved investor sentiment should signs emerge that the U.S. and global economies are improving,"" said Jim Corridore, head of industrial equity research for S&P Capital IQ, in a recent commentary.Although the U.S. GDP shrank by 3 percent in the first quarter due to the awful winter in two-thirds of North America, growth is expected to pick up through the rest of this year.Most pundits predict the overall economy will expand about 2 percent this year. After a strong employment report last week, analysts are even dallying with the idea of a 4 percent rise in U.S. economic growth. The market has responded heartily to this optimism, with the Dow Jones Industrials Index closing above 17,000 last Thursday. The general mood of the market will depend upon earnings growth, which many analysts predict could reach into double digits in the second half of this year.Yet don't assume that transportation is going to be a smooth ride indefinitely. The sector is particularly sensitive to oil and fuel prices. With the ongoing turmoil in Iraq - and resulting spike in oil prices - it will be a good idea to keep a close eye on this sector.

Beersheba has become a hub for security research as Israel's military moves its headquarters to the southern city.Meanwhile, Israeli firms have attracted growing foreign investment over the past two years to develop cutting-edge tools for detecting and preventing cyberattacks, challenging U.S. and European giants who have long specialised in selling defensive tools which fall short in an age of military-grade attacks.Some Israeli start-up firms have already been acquired by top security companies and this year the pace of initial public share offerings has begun to pick up, the latest being Cyber-Ark Software, which is set to debut on Nasdaq on Wednesday.""The big drama within this space is the shifting of budgets,"" Gadi Tirosh, a partner with Cyber-Ark investor Jerusalem Venture Partners (JVP), said of the move away from perimeter defences such as firewalls to focus on detecting and preventing attacks before they can reach inside organisations. BATTLE-HARDENED START-UPS IBM, Cisco Systems and EMC have all snapped up local firms and set up research and development centres here, with Cisco's $5 billion purchase in 2012 of NDS, whose software enables TV companies to deliver encrypted content, the largest ever acquisition of an Israeli company.And since 2010 there has also been a large increase in the number of Israeli cyber security start-ups that have raised capital privately.Many of these firms focus on emerging threats to mobile phone users and the need to secure the dizzying array of interconnected devices, appliance, vehicles and sensor-laden equipment that have become known as the Internet of Things.""It's a market that's here to stay,"" the government's chief scientist, Avi Hasson, told Reuters. ""It's touching ever more aspects of our lives,"" he said.In 2013 35 companies raised $140.9 million, compared with 18 firms that raised $35.8 million in 2010, according to the Israel Venture Capital (IVC) Research Center, and in total cyber security firms have raised $388 million in the last four years. While for most of this period the majority of capital was invested by Israeli funds, in 2013 the trend shifted, with foreign and other investors accounting for 58 percent of private investment, according to IVC.A handful of start-ups have managed to go public so far, following in the footsteps of 21-year-old Check Point Software Technologies, now Israel's biggest tech firm with a market value of $13.5 billion. Check Point's shares have risen 70 percent in less than two years, hitting a 13-year high of $72.78 earlier this month as it sees growing demand for security products and wins market share from competitors.Imperva, founded by Shlomo Kramer, a co-founder of Check Point, went public in late 2011, while this year Varonis Systems has listed on Nasdaq and SafeCharge on London's junior AIM market.The latest market debutante, Cyber-Ark, is looking to raise about $80 million on Nasdaq in an offering expected to value the company at up to $500 million.Meanwhile the number of Israeli companies being acquired has also accelerated since the big purchases of NDS and Trusteer in 2012 and 2013. According to IVC's database there have already been seven acquisitions of cyber security software firms in 2014, the largest being Palo Alto Networks' purchase of Cyvera for $200 million.JVP, which owns 46 percent of Cyber-Ark, has also been wooed by 250 security firms seeking to raise money the past two years. That has unnerved some investors who believe there is a danger of a market bubble developing, while others say the sector remains in its infancy and demand will only grow as the world becomes increasingly connected via the Internet, facing more complex security threats as a result.MILITARY EXPERTISE Isaac Ben-Israel, the country's former top military scientist and now head of Tel Aviv University's cyber research centre and Netanyahu's adviser on the subject, said Israel's goal is to become one of the five leading cyber powers and already ranks among the top three in terms of cyber readiness, along with Finland and Sweden.""In a normal day we have 100,000 to 200,000 attacks per day. In times of emergency ... this goes up to 2 million a day. This drives us to develop protection technology,"" he said.The country now accounts for 7 percent of the $60 billion a year global cyber-security market and as much as 13 percent of new R&D in the sector. Four years ago these numbers were only a third of what they are now.A crucial factor behind the growth is Israel's compulsory military service with local firms benefiting from close cooperation with the defence forces and the talent that has emerged from elite military units.Technology units such as 8200, the army's surveillance arm, are given priority when recruiting the country's brightest high school graduates. Industry pioneer Gil Shwed, founder and CEO of Check Point, served in the 8200 unit.JVP, which has a third of its portfolio in cyber security, established its Cyber Labs for young start-ups in Beersheba, where several multinationals, including EMC and defence contractor Lockheed Martin, also have operations.""Israel is a desired location to establish a footprint and grow,"" said Haden Land, vice president for R&D at Lockheed Martin, which last month set up a separate subsidiary in Israel focused on technology and is working with EMC and Ben-Gurion University on joint cyber security research projects.""You have very good human capital in this discipline ... that can think the right way and can architect the right way to address these new areas,"" said Orna Berry, a top executive at EMC, which has invested over $2 billion in Israel since 2006.

43,"   By Scott Malone  Mass shootings have occurred in the United States with increasing frequency over the past 14 years, with 486 people killed in 160 incidents, according to a Federal Bureau of Investigation analysis released on Wednesday.There were an average of 16.4 active-shooter incidents from 2007 through 2013, more than double the 6.4 average from 2000 to 2006, the report found.Active shootings, which the report defined as incidents not directly linked to gang violence or drugs and where police and citizens had the time to influence the outcome, occurred most frequently in places of business, which saw 46 percent of the incidents, followed by schools, where 24 percent occurred.The report was released a day after a man who had recently been fired from his job at a United Parcel Service Inc distribution center in Birmingham, Alabama, shot dead two supervisors at the site before turning the gun on himself. That ending, the gunman taking his own life, was a common one in the events the FBI analyzed, with 40 percent of the shooters turning their guns on themselves. Police shot and killed the attacker in 13 percent of the cases analyzed.The deadliest incidents were the 2007 shooting at Virginia Tech University, where 32 people were killed, and the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, where 27 died excluding the gunman. FBI officials noted that many shooters had studied past incidents, particularly prominent ones like Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook or the 1999 attack at Columbine High School in Colorado, where two gunmen killed 12 students and a teacher.That incident was not included in the 160 counted by the FBI.""Many offenders look to past offenses, particularly notable ones such as Columbine and Virginia Tech and Sandy Hook, and they study and they research those attacks,"" Andre Simons, an FBI supervisory special agent, told a briefing in Washington. ""They look back to these past offenses and they oftentimes find inspiration and they oftentimes seek to emulate or copycat those particular offenses. So the copycat phenomenon is real,"" he said.In 13 percent of the cases, unarmed bystanders or school staffers confronted the gunman, ending the shooting by subduing the attacker until police could arrive.The FBI said that suggests both police and civilians would benefit from training on how to handle shooting incidents. ""It is important, too, that training and exercises include not only an understanding of the threats faced but also the risks and options available in active shooter incidents,"" the report found.Richard Parker, a lecturer at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, noted the numbers of mass shootings are minimal compared with the roughly 14,000 murders and 1.15 million violent crimes reported in the United States per year.""They get more attention than they statistically represent because they are so rare,"" Parker said. ""You have to ask where are the bulk of murders taking place, and this doesn't even qualify as a significant minority. This is a tiny, tiny fraction.""

49,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Determined not to repeat a holiday season that left millions of packages delivered too late and customers seething, United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N) are investing heavily in new infrastructure - but the continued dynamic growth of e-commerce will test those efforts. The world's two largest shipping companies are building new facilities, adding more temporary holiday workers and pushing retailers to help them avoid a recurrence of a pre-Christmas shipping logjam. Even so, the rise in shipping originating with e-tailers including Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Zappos could test even the new capacity levels. Peak days at both companies now equal roughly double their average daily volumes. Mark Wallace, vice president of engineering in the United States at UPS, said the company still has volume limits, despite substantial investment this year. ""There is only so much capacity in the network.""A late spike in demand last year caused by last-minute online promotions plagued express delivery companies. Some 2 million express packages were left stranded by delivery companies on Christmas Eve, according to shipment-tracking software developer ShipMatrix Inc. UPS experienced far more severe problems than FedEx.  This year, UPS has allocated $500 million to expand and improve facilities and is hiring 95,000 seasonal workers - or 10,000 more than last year - to handle 2014 holiday packages.During its second-quarter conference call, UPS Chief Executive David Abney said ""these projects will weigh on earnings in 2014"" but pay off long-term. A spokesman declined to comment further ahead of UPS's next quarterly earnings, expected to be released on Friday.  FedEx has said up to 90 percent of its $1.2 billion investments this year are to boost capacity. The company plans to hire 50,000 seasonal workers, up from 40,000 last year. Patrick Fitzgerald, senior vice president of marketing and communications at FedEx, said this year's capital investments would not affect the company's earnings forecast.The investment is designed to address the rapid growth of consumer goods ordered online. Through 2013, peak volume, referring to the busiest day of the year, had climbed 57 percent over five years at FedEx, to 22 million packages. It jumped 40 percent at UPS, to 31 million packages.  Deloitte LLP predicts sales growth of up to 14 percent this holiday season, and FedEx said on Wednesday it expected peak-day package volumes to reach 22.6 million this year. The peaks have become more pronounced closer to Christmas as last-minute online free shipping deals have proliferated. Unchecked, those peaks will only grow worse, experts said. ""The e-commerce shipping model isn't sustainable in its current form,"" said Yossi Sheffi, a professor of engineering systems and director of the Center for Transportation & Logistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). ""You cannot build a shipping network to operate 365 days a year based on a spike in packages three days before Christmas.""         PROTECTING THE CORE  In a bid to better manage the peak, the shipping giants have asked retailers for clearer estimates of 2014 holiday volumes and have encouraged earlier deadlines for consumer orders. ""We now have the kind of visibility we didn't before on what to expect from our largest customers,"" said UPS's Wallace.FedEx's Fitzgerald said customers could be disappointed if they offer last-minute sales without first consulting FedEx. ""If we don't have the right discussions up-front, we may not be ready to handle"" a sudden surge, Fitzgerald said.  In mid-August, Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) gave its carriers its peak forecast, both by day and by shipping facility, three weeks earlier than usual. Contingency plans include shipping from alternate Wal-Mart distribution centers or upgrading packages to faster services if ""deemed at risk"" of missing Christmas, said spokeswoman Jaeme Lazckowski.Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) has moved up its cutoff point for Christmas deliveries by three hours on Dec. 23, and UPS has agreed to additional last-minute flights for the company.   FedEx and UPS had no choice but to engage retailers in reducing peak loads and getting them to manage consumer expectations on realistic delivery deadlines, said veteran Cowan & Co analyst Helane Becker. ""They can't keep trying to squeeze more and more through such a narrow funnel,"" she said. Both FedEx and UPS are concerned about impact on their core business-to-business customers.  ""When packages went undelivered last year, that also affected high-volume business customers,"" said Rick Jones, a former UPS executive and now CEO of regional delivery company Lone Star Overnight. ""Have no doubt this is not about getting little Johnny his Christmas present. It's about protecting that core business.""Logistics experts say the 2014 adjustments are a temporary fix, and more changes are needed for the 2015 holiday season. A price hike might help tackle ubiquitous free shipping offers, and negotiations with Amazon, in particular, likely will occur.  ""What you will see is Amazon Prime with a little minus for the three days before Christmas - where free shipping doesn't apply,"" said MIT's Sheffi. ""And Amazon will be able to blame UPS for it anyway.""Amazon declined specific comment. ""We work very closely with all of our delivery partners and are confident in their ability to deliver for Amazon customers this holiday,"" the company said in a statement. FedEx's Fitzgerald said the company does not plan a 2015 price increase ""at this point.""

51,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO United Parcel Service Inc may charge major customers more for a surge in late, unplanned packages or turn down the business if it threatens disruptions during the peak holiday season, a top executive said on Friday, trying to avoid a repeat of last year's delivery meltdown. UPS (UPS.N) and main rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N), both considered U.S. economic bellwethers, are approaching their busiest time. Last year a last-minute surge in online consumer promotions left an estimated 2 million express packages stranded on Christmas Eve.""If it (a late surge) creates challenges and adds costs we would charge a premium,"" Chief Financial Officer Kurt Kuehn told Reuters. ""If it puts our service at risk, we would have to deny (the business)."" Kuehn spoke after UPS, the world's largest package delivery company, posted higher-than-expected third-quarter profit, driven by rising U.S. consumer and business demand plus strong growth in Asia.Kuehn said UPS remained concerned about U.S. railroad service problems - UPS is a major rail customer - saying ""they need to improve their service metrics."" The major railroad have struggled this year to meet demand due to a growing economy, rising oil-by-rail freight and a record harvest.The problems especially affected UPS, which has invested $500 million to boost its infrastructure to handle the coming holiday season. Like Memphis-based FedEx, UPS has worked with major retailers this year to get a clearer forecast for package volumes and online promotions to avoid a repeat of last year's debacle.FedEx has said if a major retailer decides to offer a last-minute online promotion without notifying the company, which threatens its service, the company won't be able to handle the business. UPS reported earnings per share of $1.32, up 14 percent from $1.16 a year earlier. Analysts expected $1.28 per share. UPS shares rose 1.1 percent to $101.57.Atlanta-based UPS confirmed its full-year profit outlook, predicting earnings per share of between $4.90 to $5.00. Analyst expected $4.95 per share.UPS said annual package shipments should increase 11 percent year over year in December.  The National Retail Federation predicted U.S. holiday retail sales will rise 4.1 percent this year to $616.9 billion.

52,"  (Adds CFO interview, analyst quote, details, background, updates stock action)By Nick CareyCHICAGO Oct 24 United Parcel Service Inc may charge major customers more for a surge in late, unplanned packages or turn down the business if it threatens disruptions during the peak holiday season, a top executive said on Friday, trying to avoid a repeat of last year's delivery meltdown.UPS and main rival FedEx Corp, both considered U.S. economic bellwethers, are approaching their busiest time. Last year a last-minute surge in online consumer promotions left an estimated 2 million express packages stranded on Christmas Eve.""If it (a late surge) creates challenges and adds costs we would charge a premium,"" Chief Financial Officer Kurt Kuehn told Reuters. ""If it puts our service at risk, we would have to deny (the business).""Kuehn spoke after UPS, the world's largest package delivery company, posted higher-than-expected third-quarter profit, driven by rising U.S. consumer and business demand plus strong growth in Asia.Kuehn said UPS remained concerned about U.S. railroad service problems - UPS is a major rail customer - saying ""they need to improve their service metrics."" The major railroad have struggled this year to meet demand due to a growing economy, rising oil-by-rail freight and a record harvest. The problems especially affected UPS, which has invested $500 million to boost its infrastructure to handle the coming holiday season.Like Memphis-based FedEx, UPS has worked with major retailers this year to get a clearer forecast for package volumes and online promotions to avoid a repeat of last year's debacle.FedEx has said if a major retailer decides to offer a last-minute online promotion without notifying the company, which threatens its service, the company won't be able to handle the business. UPS reported earnings per share of $1.32, up 14 percent from $1.16 a year earlier. Analysts expected $1.28 per share.UPS shares rose 1.1 percent to $101.57.Atlanta-based UPS confirmed its full-year profit outlook, predicting earnings per share of between $4.90 to $5.00. Analyst expected $4.95 per share. UPS said annual package shipments should increase 11 percent year over year in December.The National Retail Federation predicted U.S. holiday retail sales will rise 4.1 percent this year to $616.9 billion.

54,"  (Repeats Oct. 23 story for wider readership)By Nick CareyCHICAGO Oct 23 Determined not to repeat a holiday season that left millions of packages delivered too late and customers seething, United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp are investing heavily in new infrastructure - but the continued dynamic growth of e-commerce will test those efforts.The world's two largest shipping companies are building new facilities, adding more temporary holiday workers and pushing retailers to help them avoid a recurrence of a pre-Christmas shipping logjam.Even so, the rise in shipping originating with e-tailers including Amazon.com Inc and Zappos could test even the new capacity levels. Peak days at both companies now equal roughly double their average daily volumes.Mark Wallace, vice president of engineering in the United States at UPS, said the company still has volume limits, despite substantial investment this year. ""There is only so much capacity in the network.""A late spike in demand last year caused by last-minute online promotions plagued express delivery companies.  Some 2 million express packages were left stranded by delivery companies on Christmas Eve, according to shipment-tracking software developer ShipMatrix Inc. UPS experienced far more severe problems than FedEx.This year, UPS has allocated $500 million to expand and improve facilities and is hiring 95,000 seasonal workers - or 10,000 more than last year - to handle 2014 holiday packages.During its second-quarter conference call, UPS Chief Executive David Abney said ""these projects will weigh on earnings in 2014"" but pay off long-term. A spokesman declined to comment further ahead of UPS's next quarterly earnings, expected to be released on Friday.FedEx has said up to 90 percent of its $1.2 billion investments this year are to boost capacity. The company plans to hire 50,000 seasonal workers, up from 40,000 last year. Patrick Fitzgerald, senior vice president of marketing and communications at FedEx, said this year's capital investments would not affect the company's earnings forecast. The investment is designed to address the rapid growth of consumer goods ordered online. Through 2013, peak volume, referring to the busiest day of the year, had climbed 57 percent over five years at FedEx, to 22 million packages. It jumped 40 percent at UPS, to 31 million packages.Deloitte LLP predicts sales growth of up to 14 percent this holiday season, and FedEx said on Wednesday it expected peak-day package volumes to reach 22.6 million this year.The peaks have become more pronounced closer to Christmas as last-minute online free shipping deals have proliferated. Unchecked, those peaks will only grow worse, experts said.""The e-commerce shipping model isn't sustainable in its current form,"" said Yossi Sheffi, a professor of engineering systems and director of the Center for Transportation & Logistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). ""You cannot build a shipping network to operate 365 days a year based on a spike in packages three days before Christmas."" PROTECTING THE CORE In a bid to better manage the peak, the shipping giants have asked retailers for clearer estimates of 2014 holiday volumes and have encouraged earlier deadlines for consumer orders.""We now have the kind of visibility we didn't before on what to expect from our largest customers,"" said UPS's Wallace.FedEx's Fitzgerald said customers could be disappointed if they offer last-minute sales without first consulting FedEx. ""If we don't have the right discussions up-front, we may not be ready to handle"" a sudden surge, Fitzgerald said. In mid-August, Wal-Mart Stores Inc gave its carriers its peak forecast, both by day and by shipping facility, three weeks earlier than usual. Contingency plans include shipping from alternate Wal-Mart distribution centers or upgrading packages to faster services if ""deemed at risk"" of missing Christmas, said spokeswoman Jaeme Lazckowski.Nordstrom Inc has moved up its cutoff point for Christmas deliveries by three hours on Dec. 23, and UPS has agreed to additional last-minute flights for the company.FedEx and UPS had no choice but to engage retailers in reducing peak loads and getting them to manage consumer expectations on realistic delivery deadlines, said veteran Cowan & Co analyst Helane Becker. ""They can't keep trying to squeeze more and more through such a narrow funnel,"" she said.Both FedEx and UPS are concerned about impact on their core business-to-business customers.""When packages went undelivered last year, that also affected high-volume business customers,"" said Rick Jones, a former UPS executive and now CEO of regional delivery company Lone Star Overnight. ""Have no doubt this is not about getting little Johnny his Christmas present. It's about protecting that core business.""Logistics experts say the 2014 adjustments are a temporary fix, and more changes are needed for the 2015 holiday season. A price hike might help tackle ubiquitous free shipping offers, and negotiations with Amazon, in particular, likely will occur.""What you will see is Amazon Prime with a little minus for the three days before Christmas - where free shipping doesn't apply,"" said MIT's Sheffi. ""And Amazon will be able to blame UPS for it anyway.""Amazon declined specific comment. ""We work very closely with all of our delivery partners and are confident in their ability to deliver for Amazon customers this holiday,"" the company said in a statement.FedEx's Fitzgerald said the company does not plan a 2015 price increase ""at this point."" A UPS spokesman said the company has focused on fixing last year's problems instead of pricing.

Calvin Darden Jr., 40, pleaded guilty to two counts of wire fraud on Tuesday before U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in New York, less than two weeks before his criminal trial was scheduled to begin.Prosecutors had accused Darden of an elaborate scheme using fake emails and bank statements to secure more than $8 million to buy the men's magazine. He was also accused of a separate fraud in which he tricked a Taiwanese company into paying him $500,000 after falsely claiming he would arrange a New York Knicks exhibition basketball game in Taiwan.Darden’s father, also named Calvin, is the former vice president of U.S. operations for package delivery company UPS.The younger Darden is scheduled to be sentenced in April.

58,"   By Nick Carey | ATLANTA  ATLANTA United Parcel Service Inc's chief executive officer said on Monday the company's closer collaboration with major retailers should bring a smooth holiday season, but he said UPS would charge customers more or even refuse packages if last-minute sales by a major customer threaten the company's system.    ""With the changes we’ve made, I feel very comfortable about peak (season) this year,"" David Abney told Reuters in an interview at UPS headquarters in Atlanta.     Imposing additional charges or refusing delivery for existing customers would be ""the exception versus the rule,"" Abney said. The company has put in place a ""control tower"" system in which company experts manage the flow of packages and anticipate problems.     Last year a late surge in pre-Christmas online retail sales left an estimated 2 million express packages undelivered in the United States. UPS, the world's largest package delivery company, was badly affected by the last-minute flood of packages.FedEx Corp, the main rival of UPS, is also working with retailers to manage package volume forecasts. The Memphis-based company has made it clear that if a late, unplanned holiday sale threatened to derail its system, it could decline that business.  Peak day package volumes at UPS and FedEx in the run-up to Christmas have jumped 40 percent and 57 percent, respectively, since 2009. Those volumes are roughly double the average daily number of packages the companies haul. Deloitte LLP predicts U.S. e-commerce sales growth of up to 14 percent this holiday season, and robust online growth is expected to continue. Abney said the company’s brick-and-mortar and e-commerce retail customers are holding ""Black Friday"" sales earlier than normal this year and that UPS believes it is part of an effort by retailers to find ways to smooth out the pre-Christmas online ordering bulge. If a late e-commerce surge raises costs for UPS this year, Abney said, ""We certainly in 2015 and beyond will look very closely at what we need to do"" to offset those costs, including the possibility of holiday season price increases. The actual delivery of a package is the most cost- and labor-intensive part of what companies like UPS and FedEx do. Delivering to residential addresses is more expensive than to businesses, since businesses tend to receive multiple packages.

61,"   By Nick Carey | ATLANTA  ATLANTA Lower U.S. gasoline prices could boost consumer spending ahead of the holiday season, a critical period for the retail sector, a top executive at United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) said on Tuesday.""The impact of low fuel prices right now is it puts more discretionary dollars in consumers’ pockets,"" Chief Financial Officer Kurt Kuehn told Reuters at the company's Atlanta headquarters.""We do think that it is certainly not bad timing that all of the Santa Clauses around the country will maybe have a few more dollars in discretionary spending for the holidays.""Gasoline prices have recently fallen to a national average of below $3 per gallon. Kuehn said this will not affect spending on high-priced goods ""but an extra $20 or $30 a month can make a difference.""Any boost for retailers could be a boon for UPS and its main rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N) thanks to the ever-expanding Ecommerce market. Ecommerce accounts for around 45 percent of UPS' revenue and the company expects that to rise to 50 percent within five years.Kuehn said the world's largest package delivery company is ""fairly bullish"" on the U.S. economy, expecting annual growth of around 3 percent over the next two years, which should drive business growth and further lift consumer spending. Low gasoline prices will not deter UPS from continuing to invest in alternative fuel vehicles, Kuehn said. UPS currently has around 3,000 alternative fuel vehicles, predominantly natural gas. Kuehn said while it is more expensive to retrofit a truck to use natural gas, the lower cost of the fuel means the vehicles pay for themselves over the long term.""The economics are still pretty good even at these prices,"" he said. ""We’re very excited still about natural gas as a very viable replacement for traditional diesel engines for fleets.""UPS is gearing up for the holiday season, traditionally its busiest. The company fared poorly last year as a late major surge in Ecommerce packages overloaded its network, and extreme winter conditions hindered delivery.  Kuehn said UPS has focused on its top 40 retail customers, talking to them weekly to adjust shipping forecasts and embedding staff to better understand their customers' needs.

63,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Dec 24 Facing a slump in the mail it had been delivering since the days of America's Revolutionary War, in 2012 the U.S. Postal Service began aggressively targeting e-commerce and lapsed customers as the way to salvage its declining business.""Really it started almost at the level of cold-calling, talking to people who really hadn't spoken to us in a long time,"" said Nagisa Manabe, who joined the USPS in May 2012 as chief marketing and sales officer from Coca-Cola Co after a career in the private sector. ""And really trying to persuade them to consider us as a very viable alternative in the shipping market.""With further drops in its traditional bread-and-butter products ahead, the USPS wants to capitalize on e-commerce, which consulting firm Detroit LLP has predicted should grow 14 percent this holiday season alone. But industry experts question whether the USPS has enough space in its delivery vans and whether its unionized work force can handle a greater proportion of the e-commerce market.Over the past two years the USPS has rolled out real-time scanning for packages, a vital tool for online retailers and consumers alike to track their packages. It is also upgrading all of its delivery workers' handheld scanners.The rise of the Internet has taken a heavy toll on first-class mail, the USPS's most profitable product. That falling business played a significant role in the USPS's fiscal 2014 loss of $5.5 billion, its eighth consecutive year in the red.From 2009 to 2013, the volume of first-class mail deliveries dropped more than 20 percent. In the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, USPS deliveries declined to 155.4 billion pieces from 158.2 billion. First-class deliveries accounted for 2.2 billion pieces of that decline.But package deliveries rose to more than 4 billion pieces from 3.7 billion, accounting for $1.1 billion of the USPS's revenue growth of $1.9 billion. In the run-up to Christmas, the USPS has been doing Sunday deliveries for Amazon.com Inc  in a number of cities. Manabe adds that the agency will handle the online retailer's push into same-day and next-day deliveries ""in many markets.""EBay Inc is another major customer and Manabe says ""pretty much anyone who's in the e-commerce space at least does some volume with us."" FLEET OVERHAUL Many in the delivery industry are waiting to see how the USPS has handled surging e-commerce volumes in the days before Christmas.The USPS's competitive advantage lies in the fact that it already delivers to every house in America and analysts estimate it can do so for around a quarter of the cost charged by United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp, which are both competitors and customers of the USPS. ""The U.S. Postal Service has the ultimate last-mile delivery network, so it has a real opportunity here,"" said Vinnie DeAngelis, vice president of postal relations at Neopost USA, which provides tracking and other software for e-commerce retailers and delivery companies.According to shipment-tracking software developer ShipMatrix Inc, in 2013 the USPS accounted for 59.2 percent of e-commerce deliveries, while UPS accounted for 31.9 percent and FedEx 8.9 percent. The USPS has predicted holiday package volume growth of around 12 percent this year from Nov. 17 to Christmas.In the years ahead, the USPS expects 80 percent of U.S. ZIP codes will see ""significantly more business,"" Manabe said. But many of the USPS's current delivery vehicles are more than 25 years old and built for mail instead of larger packages.""They (the USPS) tend to operate smaller vehicles that really cube out (fill up) pretty quickly as opposed to the network we have in place,"" FedEx Executive Vice President Michael Glenn said during a Dec. 17 earnings conference call with analysts. Delivery companies measure their vehicles' three-dimensional space in cubes. The USPS plans to spend more than $10 billion over the next four years on a new fleet of vehicles. Manabe said that could mean three or four different sizes of vehicles to handle different package volumes in urban and rural areas.Some industry experts are concerned that the USPS, whose operations are dictated by Congress, may have trouble handling e-commerce growth due to its quasi-government unionized workers.""When I think about the USPS business model, I don't believe they are ever going to get the productivity of FedEx or UPS,"" said Brian Hancock, a board member of the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals.But Manabe insists the unionized work force is on board and recognizes the importance of e-commerce.The last few delivery days before Christmas have been a test for the USPS. After struggling with a late surge in online orders last year that left an estimated 2 million packages stranded on Christmas Eve, UPS and FedEx both made it clear this year that they would reject a last-minute flood of packages if it threatened their systems.Rick Jones, a former UPS executive and now CEO of regional delivery company Lone Star Overnight, says that for many retailers this holiday season, the USPS may have become the carrier of last resort.""The question is whether their smaller vehicles, which are designed for mail rather than packages, could handle the extra volume,"" he said.

64,"   By Deepa Seetharaman | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Dec 26 Major U.S. retailers missed fewer Christmas deliveries this year, according to two small, early surveys released on Friday, partly reflecting a year's worth of investments made to avoid 2013's last-minute shipping debacle.This year, 7 percent of packages ordered online did not arrive by their promised delivery date, compared with 12 percent in 2013, according to a survey of 160 orders placed by retail-intelligence firm StellaService.Separately, management consulting firm Kurt Salmon said 13 percent of the nearly 100 e-commerce orders it surveyed did not make it in time for Christmas, down from 15 percent in 2013.In 2013, some 2 million express packages were left stranded on Christmas Eve, according to shipment-tracking software developer ShipMatrix Inc. The reasons given were, in part, a surge in demand triggered by last-minute online promotions and bad weather.This year, retailers pushed back the cut-off date for Christmas delivery by one day, but most were still able to hit the mark because of improvements to their logistics infrastructure, better weather and fewer last-minute deals. ""We saw a lot less of the 11th-hour promotions,"" said Steve Osburn, director of supply chain for Kurt Salmon. ""They may have extended their deadline by about a day, but they were a little less aggressive about pushing those promotions.""Retailers set a Christmas cut-off delivery date between Dec. 19 and Dec. 20 this year, he said. The four retailers with the most aggressive cutoff date of Dec. 23 - Apple Inc, Dell Inc, Nordstrom Inc and Zappos, a unit of Amazon.com Inc - all made their deadlines, StellaService said.The better results also stemmed from the heavy investments by United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp, the world's two largest shipping companies. UPS allocated $500 million to expand and improve its 2014 holiday operations. Both built new facilities, added more temporary workers and pushed retailers for clearer estimates and earlier deadlines to avoid last year's missteps.The level of communication between carriers and retailers was ""significantly higher"" this year, Osburn said, pointing to a retail client who, in the run-up to Christmas, heard from one carrier two to three times a day. But both surveys found that some retailers still fell short of their promises, reflecting the difficulty of accurately calculating holiday demand as e-commerce orders grow rapidly.StellaService found nine of the top 40 retailers it tested missed delivery dates: Best Buy Co Inc, Costco Wholesale Corp, Crate & Barrel, J.C. Penney Co Inc, Kohl's Corp , Macy's Inc, Staples Inc, Toys 'R Us and Wayfair Inc.Best Buy declined to comment. The other retailers were not immediately available for comment.Both Staples and Toys 'R Us missed deliveries in multiple regions in the United States, and in one case, Staples canceled an order without notifying the shopper, StellaService said.Osburn found one case where a retailer fell behind on orders and attempted to upgrade shipping on packages to make the Christmas deadline. But the volume was three to four times higher than its previous estimates, and the retailer missed the Christmas deadline, Osburn said, declining to name the company.

65,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Dec 29 United Parcel Service Inc  and FedEx Corp are rolling out new pricing systems to curb online retailers' large package sizes, but industry experts warn many small firms are unprepared and could pay up to 50 percent more for shipping.Starting Monday, UPS will no longer charge for U.S. ground packages under 3 cubic feet by weight but by their ""dimensional weight.""Memphis-based FedEx will roll out the same change on Jan 5.Instead of simply weighing a box, retailers must multiply its length by its height and width, and then divide that by 166 to reach its dimensional weight. ""We believe this (dimensional weight pricing) will encourage customers to reduce their package sizes,"" Bill Smith, UPS vice president of marketing, told Reuters.UPS and FedEx announced the change in May and have worked to help customers adjust. But some small firms lack the resources to change packaging and may switch to the U.S. Postal Service (USPS), said Amine Khechfe, general manager of Endicia, which offers shipping solutions for e-commerce vendors.Under the new systems, according to Endicia, a woman's shoulder bag weighing 2 pounds - shipped in a box measuring 19 by 15 by 5 inches - will have a dimensional weight of 9 pounds and cost 45 percent more to ship. Atlanta-based UPS says retailers are shipping lighter goods, but have not shrunk the size of their packaging materials.""We need to charge a fair value for use of our asset, which in this case is space,"" FedEx spokesman Jess Bunn told Reuters. Online retailers such as Amazon are expected to be prepared. But smaller firms like Oregon-based Natura Health Products would struggle: It expects to pay 36 percent more for shipping many packages.Natura sells nutritional supplement products, many for cancer patients, and spends about $180,000 a year on shipping through FedEx and USPS, said logistics manager Chris Thorsen. To avoid such increases, the company will shift more shipping business in 2015 to USPS. The share shipped by USPS will rise to about 50 percent from 40 percent in 2014.The USPS still charges by weight. In July, it announced some price cuts to target e-commerce.Research firm Morningstar estimates e-commerce will grow at least 10 percent annually over the next five years. Analyst Keith Schoonmaker said such growth and the new pricing model will allow UPS and FedEx to let some of this low-yield business to USPS.   (Reporting By Nick Carey in Chicago. Editing by P.J.

UPS also reported that fourth-quarter profit fell from a year ago but forecast earnings within the range of estimates.UPS, the world's largest package delivery company, warned in late January it would report a fourth-quarter profit below its forecast and market expectations.The Atlanta-based company had mobilized more workers and equipment for an anticipated surge in holiday packages, but the extra business failed to materialize. The additional costs primarily affected the company's domestic ground package unit.As a result of the poor quarter, UPS Chief Executive Officer David Abney said on a conference call that the company would apply surcharges for residential packages in particular. The additional charges will be applied over several years as contracts with major customers are renegotiated.""These pricing strategies will be designed to ensure we are properly compensated for the value we provide,"" Abney said.  UPS went through a second consecutive challenging peak season. In 2013, the company was caught off-guard by a late rush of online packages that left an estimated 1.3 million parcels undelivered on Christmas Eve. UPS spent $500 million last year on network improvements and worked closely with retail customers to prevent a repeat of the miscues in late 2013, but the rising popularity of e-commerce made forecasting volumes a moving target.UPS forecast full-year 2015 earnings in a range of $5.05 to $5.30 per share. Analysts estimated $5.15 a share this year. UPS reported fourth-quarter net profit of $1.15 billion, down nearly 2 percent from $1.17 billion a year earlier.Earnings per share came in at $1.25, unchanged from a year earlier and matching the expectations of analysts. Quarterly revenue rose 6 percent to $15.9 billion from $15 billion a year earlier, including a 7.5 percent increase in revenue from its domestic ground package business.  Operating expenses jumped more than 20 percent to $9.2 billion from $7.65 billion, which caused a more than 60 percent drop in operating profit at the domestic ground package unit.On a GAAP basis, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of 49 cents due to pension-related charges.

86,"   By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday sided with a former driver for UPS Inc by giving her another chance to argue that the package delivery company discriminated against her when it refused to lighten her work duties while she was pregnant.In a 6-3 decision, the justices revived Peggy Young's  discrimination claim against the company by sending the case back to a lower court. A federal district court judge and an appeals court had earlier ruled in favor of UPS, which was backed by business groups in the case.""This is a big win for Peggy Young and other women in the workplace,"" said Sam Bagenstos, Young's lawyer.The case focused on whether, under a federal law called the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, employers must provide accommodations for pregnant workers who may have physical limitations on tasks they can perform. Young, who worked at a Maryland facility, became pregnant in 2006. She made her request for an accommodation after a midwife advised that she not be required to lift packages weighing more than 20 pounds (9 kg). Writing for the majority, liberal Justice Stephen Breyer said the lower court failed to consider the effects of UPS policies that covered non-pregnant workers who might have disabilities, injuries or otherwise might need accommodations.Breyer said there is a ""genuine dispute as to whether UPS provided more favorable treatment to at least some employees whose situation cannot reasonably be distinguished from Young's.""Bagenstos said the court ""made clear that employers may not refuse to accommodate pregnant workers based on considerations of cost or convenience when they accommodate other workers."" UPS said it was confident it would ultimately win the case.""UPS is pleased that the Supreme Court rejected the argument that UPS’s pregnancy-neutral policy was inherently discriminatory,"" a company statement said.Conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, joined by Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas, wrote a dissenting opinion accusing the court majority of coming up with ""an interpretation that is as dubious in principle as it is senseless in practice."" UPS said last October that starting this past January it would begin providing accommodations for pregnant women. The impact of the ruling could be limited in part because a 2008 amendment to the Americans with Disabilities Act could now protect women in Young’s situation. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has said employees must offer accommodations to pregnant women just as they do for other workers with similar physical limitations.The case is Young v.

92,"   By Toby Sterling and Thomas Escritt | AMSTERDAM  AMSTERDAM FedEx Corp (FDX.N) is to buy Dutch package delivery firm TNT Express TNTE.AS for an agreed 4.4 billion euros ($4.8 billion), stepping up the challenge to rivals United Parcel Service (UPS.N) and Deutsche Post (DPWGn.DE) in Europe.European regulators blocked a 2013 takeover of TNT by UPS due to concerns it would stifle competition, but analysts and executives said on Tuesday FedEx, with its strong air fleet, would complement TNT's sizeable European road network.""Europe, despite the fact that there has been low growth, is still an enormous market both for import and export,"" FedEx Corp. (FDX.N) Chief Executive Fred Smith told analysts.TNT gives FedEx access to pan-European service and the domestic UK and French markets, areas where it is not yet a big player, Smith said, while TNT customers will get access to FedEx's global distribution platform.ING analysts estimate Deutsche Post's DHL currently has a 19 percent market share in Europe, followed by UPS with 16 percent, TNT with 12 percent and FedEx at 5 percent -- meaning the deal could catapult FedEx to second place.FedEx will offer 8 euros in cash per ordinary TNT share -- a 33 percent premium on last week's close, though below UPS's 2013 offer of 9.5 euros. Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx is financing the deal with debt, the latest company to take advantage of low interest rates.TNT shares were up nearly 30 percent on Tuesday, close to FedEx's bid price, while FedEx stock rose 3.6 percent. ""FedEx has laid on the table an attractive offer price,"" said ABN Amro analyst Maarten Bakker, who has a ""hold"" rating on TNT shares. ""With FedEx having always been the most logical predator of TNT Express, we see the chances of a competing offer as slim.""FedEx finance chief Alan Graf said the company would ""be very aggressive on spending on integration in the first year,"" and the deal would create unspecified cost synergies.The deal has been unanimously recommended by TNT's supervisory board. TNT's largest shareholder, PostNL (PTNL.AS), also said it would tender its 14.7 percent stake to FedEx. PostNL shares rose 17 percent. ""SMART MOVE"" European regulators' decision to block UPS's bid for TNT dealt a blow to the Dutch firm, which had been counting on adopting much of UPS's logistics backbone. TNT, whose European market share has slumped by as much as 5 percentage points since that deal fell apart, has cut costs, sold operations and invested in its road network in an effort to hold on to customers in a weak European market for business package deliveries. ""There is no regulatory risk whatsoever,"" said Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Andre Mulder of the proposed FedEx deal, calling the offer fair in view of TNT's weaker market position.""FedEx made a smart move and their rivals can do virtually nothing,"" he added.FedEx's decision to bid followed a 17 percent drop in TNT shares over the past year, versus a 21 percent rise in the benchmark Dutch AEX index.

99,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Package delivery giant UPS does not expect to change its current expansion plan in Europe despite a recent acquisition bid by main rival FedEx that would knock the firm into third place on the continent, a top executive said on Tuesday.Last year UPS announced a four-year, $1 billion investment to grow its European network. Earlier this month, its main rival, FedEx Corp (FDX.N), announced it would buy Dutch package delivery firm TNT Express TNTE.AS. A 2013 UPS bid to buy TNT was blocked by European regulators.If FedEx's acquisition of TNT is approved, it would become the second-largest package delivery firm in Europe behind Deutsche Post's (DPWGn.DE) DHL but ahead of UPS. Speaking after UPS posted a better-than-expected quarterly net profit and reaffirmed its 2015 earnings outlook, chief financial officer Kurt Kuehn told Reuters that FedEx's bid for TNT had not changed UPS' plans.""We're continuing at full speed with our expansions plans,"" said Kuehn, who is due to retire this summer. ""Actually Europe was one of the stars of the show in the (first) quarter.""Export volumes in Europe at UPS rose over 9 percent in the quarter and Kuehn said the company's compound annual growth over the past decade has also been around 9 percent.  ""We're going to keep on doing what we can to compete in that environment,"" he said.While many publicly traded companies have complained about the impact of the strong dollar as overseas sales in foreign currencies translate into lower revenue at home, UPS said it had hedges in place on major currencies that should protect it until the end of 2016.  But Kuehn said that UPS is unprotected in minor currencies, which should be a slight drag for the company this year. At the start of 2015 UPS expected that would affect revenue by $50 million this year, but it now puts that figure at $70 million.What UPS is more concerned about moving forward is the impact of the strong dollar on U.S. exports, Kuehn said. Although he said it was hard to predict exactly how much its U.S. customers would be affected, the strength of the dollar would continue to act as a headwind for exports, he said.

UPS posted revenue of $14 billion, below Wall Street analysts' expectations of $14.3 billion. The company said it continues to expect earnings per share of between $5.05 and $5.30 for 2015. Analysts have predicted earnings per share of $5.15 for the year. UPS said it was on track to achieve long-term financial goals, previously stated as annual earnings per share growth between 9 percent to 13 percent. UPS' first-quarter profit beat came after a difficult fourth quarter in which the company overspent preparing for a holiday peak season package surge that failed to materialize.After that disappointing result, UPS said it would apply peak season surcharges. During an analyst call on Tuesday, the company said surcharges would apply to residential packages and were included in its full-year earnings guidance.

106,"   By Eric Auchard | FRANKFURT, June 25  FRANKFURT, June 25 The top executives of many a corporate giant must feel like the fictional character Gulliver, waking up to find themselves under attack from modern-day Lilliputians, small start-up companies which overwhelm their established rivals with new technologies.The old powers of market incumbents - massive scale, control over distribution, brand power, millions of customer relationships - are no longer seen as the obstacles they once were to agile rivals with innovative business models.A new survey finds business leaders believe four out of 10 top-ranked companies in their industries worldwide won't survive the next five years.They blame the accelerating change in technology, shifting business models and a need to merge to cut costs in order to ensure they don't become footnotes in someone else's corporate history.""Not just lone companies, but entire industries are being side-swiped by these effects,"" said James Macaulay, co-author of the study, which polled 941 business leaders from a dozen industries in the world's 13 biggest economies.""Digital disruption now has the potential to overturn incumbents and reshape markets faster than perhaps any force in history,"" the survey states. The report can be found at bit.ly/1IyV1cKThe survey was conducted by a research centre at top-ranked Swiss business school IMD, the International Institute for Management Development, with backing from Internet equipment maker Cisco, where Macaulay works as a consultant.INDUSTRIES AT RISK Industries with the highest number of top-rated companies at risk were hospitality/travel, media and entertainment, retail, financial services and consumer goods/manufacturing, in that order, the survey showed.Meanwhile, industries which still largely deliver physical products or services such as pharmaceuticals, utilities and the oil and gas sectors were rated the least likely to be disrupted.Michael Wade, another co-author of the survey, said there were some things software could not replace. ""Consumers are still unlikely to take an app if they get a headache,"" joked Wade, a professor of strategy at the Lausanne-based IMD business school. But even for industries such as pharmaceuticals, where regulatory protections, high capital costs and complex production processes still rule, Wade said new threats are coming from start-ups analysing ""big data"" to offer a personalised approach  to medicine, for example.Meanwhile in travel e-commerce aggregators have taken millions of customers from direct bookings with hotels and airlines already struggling with a decade of decline in business travel amid the economic and structural challenges.""Disruptive players are coming from out of nowhere,"" says Macaulay. ""Now it's individuals who want to rent their homes and vehicles,"" he said, referring to home rental service Airbnb, office-sharing firm LiquidSpace and similar ""sharing economy"" start-ups.Karl Ulrich Garnadt, chief executive of the German Airlines division of Deutsche Lufthansa AG, told venture investors in Berlin this month that his industry still spends too much time worrying about direct competitors in Asia or the Mideast.He noted how the industry missed the rise of mobile travel apps, the top dozen of which now collectively have a valuation around 88 billion euros ($99 billion), while the market capitalisation of Lufthansa, Europe's largest airline group, has shrunk to 5.5 billion euros from double that a decade ago.""Today we are too limited in our thinking. We need to widen our horizon, we need to think like the customer,"" the airline industry veteran said. Towards that end, Lufthansa is seeking ways to woo back customers who expect them to deliver more than boarding passes to their mobile phones. With free on-board Wi-Fi soon to be available on every plane, he wants flight attendants to use new apps to help frequent travellers make new travel bookings in mid-air.In banking big lenders are now all at giving board-level attention to the rapid growth of ""fintech"" start-ups in markets from mortgage-lending to wealth management to small business loans.In an era of cloud computing and services delivered to smartphones, fintech start-ups have no need to duplicate the retail branch networks that tied customers to banks. And new players aren't saddled with making heavy investments in creaky,  decades-old back-office banking systems.""Lending remains pretty much an archaic process for banks, largely based on paper forms that are designed to give customers a poor experience,"" said Martin McPhee, a senior vice president at Cisco who heads the company's consulting arm.""Research shows that four out of five banking customers will happily leave their banks for a better customer experience,"" he said. HUNT OR BE HUNTED In corporate circles, the most common sobriquet for these digital threats is Google or, less frequently, Amazon .But, depending on the industry, the big threat goes by different names: for automakers and transport companies, it is Tesla, the luxury electric car company, or Uber, the online taxi service. For hotels and airlines, it's Airbnb or Trivago, now majority owned by Expedia.Tesla has also hit the radar of utilities with its announcement in April on its ""energy storage"" business, which aims to produce batteries capable of solving the elusive problem of storing electrical energy produced at optimum times for use at other times.""Everyone thought (Tesla founder) Elon Musk was building a car company, but now we find he is building an alternative energy company,"" McPhee said.There is also mounting wave of digitally inspired, cross-border mergers, stepped-up corporate venture funding and a willingness to place bigger bets on risky business models that can undermine a company's existing activities.BMW-owned British carmaker Mini said this week customers would in the future be able to offer their private vehicles for car-sharing, mindful of a trend amongst younger drivers to not have their own cars.The challengers offer massive improvements in how customers use the products or services of established businesses. They combine that with finding ways to slash costs and enter markets without investing heavily to own physical assets or distribution infrastructure, says McPhee.Uber, the online taxi-hailing service is now applying similar strategies to sign up drivers to deliver everything from groceries to heavy equipment, in a challenge to logistics giants like FedEx and UPS.McPhee notes the historical parallel to what occurred after the advent of the Web in the mid 1990s: Just 25 percent of the Fortune 100 top U.S. companies were still in existence 15 years later.

129,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO After two years of disappointing profits from the holiday season, United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) is hoping a network of mom-and-pop retailers will help it avoid a third blue Christmas.Investors will be watching closely.The coming weeks will be a referendum on the expansion of UPS's Access Point network earlier this year to 8,000 locations in 100 cities from a few large test markets. The network, including 4,400 UPS stores and thousands of small retailers, is meant to give the company's drivers more places to leave packages for customers to pick up, avoiding multiple delivery attempts. UPS says it costs three times as much to deliver to a home as to a business.  In densely populated areas, Access Point will ""have a dramatic impact"" on UPS's ability to operate during the peak season, said Geoff Light, U.S. president of product development. UPS is also levying surcharges on packages delivered to homes. Handling holiday shipping profitably and effectively is critical to UPS, which has delivered underwhelming results for the past two Christmas seasons. In 2013, a last-minute pre-Christmas surge in e-commerce packages caught the company off-guard, and last year it overestimated demand and hired too many workers.Last year's fourth-quarter results underscored the hit from residential packages. UPS reported its lowest net income as a percentage of revenue for the quarter since the Great Recession in 2008. With e-commerce activity still unpredictable, it is not certain whether the solution lies in an expanded Access Point network.  It is clear, though, that if the world's largest package delivery company slips for the third consecutive holiday season, Wall Street will not take it well.“Heads would roll,"" said Greg Donaldson, founder of Donaldson Capital Management. Donaldson, whose Evansville, Indiana, firm holds UPS shares, said he was confident the company would do better this year.     Kent Winegar, portfolio manager of Austin, Texas-based asset manager Terry McDaniel & Co, which also owns the stock, stressed the importance of protecting the UPS brand. ""They need to ... make sure that every single package gets where it needs to go,"" he said.In particular, the quarter is a test for UPS Chief Executive Officer David Abney, who was chief operating officer before taking the top post in 2014. ""IN THE HOT SEAT""     If a driver cannot deliver a package in one trip, he or she drops it off at an Access Point for consumers to pick up, executives said. Retailers receive undisclosed ""nominal"" fees per package.UPS's Light said tests in markets like New York and Chicago during the 2014 peak were highly successful and that only a ""very small number"" of retailers since left the network.At Access Point store Fruit Paradise in Chicago, people who collect packages often buy its Mexican ice cream treats and snacks, said owner Gabriela Ortiz.""I'm not going to make money off the packages,"" Ortiz said.

Elizabeth Milito, senior executive counsel at the National Federation of Independent Business, said that while increased foot traffic should help small retailers, they could suffer if it distracts them from their regular customers.

131,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Package delivery company United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) posted a higher quarterly profit on Tuesday, despite its revenue being hurt by the strong U.S. dollar, and reiterated its full-year earnings outlook.During a conference call with analysts, executives at the Atlanta-based company said that package volumes during this year's key holiday peak season between Thanksgiving and New Year's should rise 10 percent. UPS said that on Dec. 22, its anticipated peak day, it expects to ship 36 million packages, or around double its daily average. After two years of disappointing fourth-quarter results, UPS is under pressure to deliver this Christmas.Chief Executive David Abney told analysts that thanks to additional capacity in its network and selective price increases to ""provide excellent service at an appropriate cost.""The world's largest package delivery company is often seen as a barometer of U.S. economic health. Abney said the company has seen some softness in the U.S. economy and that the strength of the U.S. dollar would continue to impact exports, as would soft global demand. UPS said that without the impact of the U.S. currency on its results, third-quarter revenue would have been up for the quarter. UPS also said that lower fuel surcharge revenue had weighed on results. UPS reported third-quarter net profit of $1.26 billion, or $1.39 per share, up 4 percent from $1.21 billion, or $1.32 per share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected earnings per share of $1.37.UPS said that it expects full-year earnings per share to come in at the high end of its previously-announced forecast of a range from $5.05 to $5.30. The company said earnings per share should rise in the ""low double digits"" in the fourth quarter versus the previous year.Revenue for the quarter fell slightly to $14.24 billion from $14.29 a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenue for the quarter of $14.43 billion. The company said on a currency-neutral basis, its revenue would have been up 1.8 percent. The strong U.S. dollar means that sales overseas are lower when translated into dollars.In pre-market trading, UPS shares were down 3 percent at $103.

132,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO After having difficulties getting its holiday peak season right for the past two years running, this year executives at United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) insist they have a winning formula. ""We are ready for peak season and we will deliver,"" Chief Financial Officer Richard Peretz told Reuters.Peretz spoke to Reuters after the world's largest package delivery company posted a better-than-expected quarterly net profit despite the impact of a strong U.S. dollar. The company's CFO said closer collaboration with an increasing number of retailers will allow UPS to better manage demand, and by staggering its seasonal workers it should be able to better manager costs associated with ecommerce packages in the run-up to the holidays.In 2013, a late surge of online packages hit both UPS and main rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N) leaving an estimated 2 million packages undelivered on Christmas Eve - the majority in UPS's network. Last year, the company over compensated and spent too much planning for packages that never materialized, hurting fourth-quarter earnings. As UPS tries to come up with a winning formula for Christmas, it has rolled out a network of small retailers who can hold packages for consumers in busy urban areas.This year UPS said it expects holiday volumes between Black Friday - traditionally the busiest U.S. shopping day of the year - and New Year's Eve to rise 10 percent to 630 million packages. On its expected peak day of Dec 22, UPS expects to deliver 36 million packages, or double its daily average of 18 million.  Memphis-based FedEx said on Monday it expects volumes to rise 12.4 percent to 317 million packages from Black Friday to Christmas Eve. Handling rising ecommerce volumes is a challenge for the industry, as UPS says it costs three times as much to deliver to a home as to a business. The National Retail Federation says 2015 online holiday sales could rise up to 8 percent.  UPS CFO Peretz said by working more closely with a larger number of retailers the company will have a clearer picture of pending package volumes, augmented with ""some ad hoc decision making.""He said UPS will ""help to shape demand"" by working with retailers to stagger volumes wherever possible rather than have them all enter its network at the same time. Peretz also said the 95,000 seasonal workers UPS plans to hire this year will be hired in waves to match the increase in demand as the holidays near.

139,"   By Ian Simpson | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Dec 13 As the holiday shopping season peaks, U.S. apartment complexes are being flooded with packages, from HD televisions to children's scooters, inundating lobbies and forcing building managers to take measures to extremes.With online shopping expected to reach a record this year, overwhelmed property managers are starting to put a cap on the size of the boxes they will accept, installing storage lockers or banning deliveries outright.Online purchases have spiked during this holiday season, with Americans buying $3.07 billion of goods on ""Cyber Monday,"" the first workday after the Thanksgiving holiday, a 16 percent increase year on year, according to the Adobe Digital Index Report.The Boston House, a 1950s-era apartment building in Washington that saw package deliveries grow from a couple of dozen to hundreds a week in a few years, has limited the size of boxes, said Liz Cullison, the building's general manager.""The packages got larger and larger and larger,"" Cullison said. ""That all overflowed out into the lobby. Now the lobby is overrun with packages.""Apartment buildings and complexes, home to about one in eight Americans, are being buffeted by the surge in online U.S. retail sales, which rose on an adjusted basis to $87.5 billion in the third quarter, up 15 percent from a year earlier, according to the Commerce Department. Apartment managers ""are looking at the future, and they are only seeing more packages,"" said Rick Haughey, vice president of industry technology initiatives at the National Multifamily Housing Council, an industry group.""You've got old systems in place that don't really reflect the structural changes that we've seen in retail,"" he said.HOLIDAY VOLUME  The number of U.S. packages shipped is soaring in tandem with online sales. United Parcel Service Inc, FedEx Corp  and the U.S. Postal Service all estimate an increase in the low double digits this year, in part because of one extra day in the holiday season between Thanksgiving and Christmas.UPS is forecasting 630 million deliveries during the holiday  season, up 43 percent from 2010. Deliveries for all carriers are expected to peak around Dec. 21, four days before Christmas.Boston House, where staff were already coping with deliveries of beds, furniture and other bulky items, reached its breaking point when a tenant who was moving across the country had his possessions delivered by UPS, with 40 of the carrier's biggest boxes piling up in the lobby, Cullison said. The building has limited the size of packages it will accept to 70 pounds (32 kg) and 120 inches (3.05 meters) in length and girth combined. It also has set up an overflow storage room in its basement, Cullison said.A 2014 survey of 2,768 apartment managers by the National Multifamily Housing Council found that the typical building or complex receives up to 100 packages a week and they take up to five hours a week of staff time to handle.Jose Vega, the assistant director of the 424-unit Elan City Lights, a Greystar Real Estate Partners LLC complex in Dallas, said packages were a significant burden on staff, especially during holidays.""It's extremely time-consuming just because (of) the quantity,"" he said. ""The age that we live in, you know, folks prefer to shop online and have something come to their front door.""Fed up with packages flooding its offices, Camden Property Trust, the 13th-biggest U.S. apartment owner, decided this year to refuse deliveries at its front desks. Carriers now must deliver to the customer's door.""We think this is a better customer service experience and the right decision long term,"" Julie Keel, a Camden marketing director, said in an email.

142,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) on Tuesday reported a significantly higher quarterly net profit on a strong performance during the crucial holiday season and gave a solid 2016 earnings outlook despite warning of uncertain economic conditions.The company's shares rose 1.6 percent in early trading to $95.60.Often seen as a bellwether of U.S. economic activity, UPS showed improved margins in all three of its business units. The Atlanta-based company was under pressure to deliver in the fourth quarter after two disappointing peak seasons in a row. In 2013, UPS was caught by a late surge in e-commerce packages, leaving many stranded on Christmas Eve. In 2014, the company overspent for a package surge that did not materialize. In the run-up to Christmas 2015, UPS worked to manage package flows, but to control its costs it also made clear to retail customers that if they missed key deadlines ahead of the holiday for ground deliveries, they would be charged more for moving those packages by air.  UPS posted fourth-quarter net income of $1.33 billion or $1.48 per share, nearly triple the $453 million or 49 cents per share it reported a year earlier.Analysts had on average expected earnings per share for the quarter of $1.42.Revenue in the quarter rose 1 percent to $16.1 billion from $15.9 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenue of nearly $16.3 billion. Excluding a $79 million non-cash, after-tax, mark-to-market pension charge, UPS reported earnings per share for the quarter of $1.57.Revenue at the company's core U.S. domestic package service rose 2.6 percent to $10.3 billion. Average daily shipments rose 2.4 percent on strong demand in the quarter from online retailers. Packages sent by air saw double-digit growth. The company's international package unit was more profitable in the quarter, thanks largely to a strong performance in Europe. ""Disciplined pricing, favorable customer and product mix, combined with improved operational performance"" to boost profitability, the company said. UPS said it expects full-year earnings per share for 2016 between $5.70 and $5.90. Analysts predicted earnings per share for the year of $5.73.""While we face uncertain macro-economic conditions, we are continuing to invest for profitable growth,"" chief financial officer Richard Peretz said in a statement.

143,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Despite signs of slowing growth and increasing pessimism from many in the corporate world about where the U.S. economy is headed, package delivery company UPS should continue to see growth in 2016 thanks to rising e-commerce sales and a continued focus on improving operations, a top executive said on Tuesday.""If you look at most economic forecasts ... they've come down from October to January,"" United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) chief financial officer Richard Peretz said in a phone interview. ""But online sales are still growing very substantially, so there's a lot of runway there and we think that's one of the things that fits our model very well.""""That moves us away from what's happening out in the broader macroeconomic environment,"" he added. U.S. retail ecommerce sales reached $340.61 billion in 2015, up 14.2 percent from 2014, research firm eMarketer estimates.  Peretz spoke after Atlanta-based UPS posted a better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit, boosted by e-commerce sales and improving margins as the company worked to smooth out network problems of the previous two peak holiday seasons.The prospects for the U.S. economy are unclear. Some areas are already struggling. U.S. railroads are talking loudly of a freight recession, driven primarily by plunging commodity prices. There have also been warnings that North American manufacturers face a possible industrial recession.But Peretz said UPS will build on its efforts to get its peak holiday season spending and package flows under control during the critical yet wildly unpredictable run-up to Christmas. On their busiest days, package volumes at UPS and rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N) tend to be double the average day and both companies have sought ways to better anticipate and manage spikes in traffic.  ""What we learned (in the fourth quarter) was no one's going to be a perfect forecaster,"" Peretz said. ""Let's face it, when you decide to get online and buy, is when you decide to get online and buy.""UPS spoke to retail customers ""early and often"" in 2015 and throughout peak season, pulling packages into its network sooner from retailers when it had extra capacity to avoid clogging the works. The company is now upgrading parts of its network for future volumes, which Peretz said would build on the company's performance improvements in 2015.""Even if growth isn't quite as strong on the industrial production side,"" Peretz said, ""we make up the economics, if you will, from the initiatives inside UPS.""

""This is an incremental negative for FDX and UPS as it will likely remove some higher yielding express freight and parcel volume from each of the respective networks,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst John Barnes wrote in a client note.UPS, the world's No. 1 package delivery company, operates about 240 large planes while FedEx has a fleet of about 370, Barnes noted. FedEx and UPS shares were down about 1.5 percent.FedEx said on Wednesday the announcement was not a surprise and called Amazon a valuable customer. ""We work closely with Amazon and have been aware for some time about their need for supplemental air capacity related to inventory management,"" said Patrick Fitzgerald, senior vice president of integrated marketing and communications at FedEx. The leased planes will start to go into operation on April 1, Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman said in an email.Amazon has been testing deliveries by drones but has not said when they would be in service. The duration of the leases will be five to seven years, lessor Air Transport Services Group Inc (ATSG.O) said.As part of the agreement, Amazon has the right to buy up to 19.9 percent of ATSG's stock over five years at $9.73 per share.ATSG's stock soared almost 27 percent to a record high of $14.90, before paring gains to about 16 percent.

""As long as we are able to do this and still have it be economically feasible, we're going to do it. If you have to stop and start again, it will be that much more difficult.""

155,"  * Rare opportunity for EU court to rule on EU M&A principles* UPS says EU antitrust regulators made manifest errorsBy Foo Yun CheeBRUSSELS, April 6 - Thwarted in its bid to acquire Dutch peer TNT three years ago, U.S. package delivery company UPS took its case to court on Wednesday, asking judges to overturn the EU veto because of ""manifest errors"" made by antitrust regulators.While TNT has since moved on with its tie-up with FedEx , the UPS challenge is important because it allows Europe's second-highest court to rule on key merger principles that could affect other problematic deals.The world's biggest package delivery company wanted to expand its presence in the fast-growing Asian and Latin American markets through the 5.2-billion-euro ($5.90 billion) deal. But the takeover was blocked by the European Commission because it said UPS had not offered sufficient concessions to fend off competition concerns. The EU competition enforcer in January this year cleared the FedEx and TNT deal without setting any conditions.The Commission's decision is riddled with mistakes and weak legal arguments, UPS is expected to tell the Luxembourg-based General Court. ""The Commission committed an error of law and a manifest error of assessment when examining the likely price effects of the concentration,"" the company said, according to a filing in the Commission's Official Journal.""By setting an arbitrary standard for verifiability of efficiencies, the Commission erred in law and diverged from the standard set by the case law.""UPS also accused the Commission of not giving it access to relevant and exculpatory evidence. Such merger appeals are rare, said Tobias Caspary, a partner at London-based Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson.""The merger would have resulted in a 4 to 3 (major industry players) scenario that often attracts substantial scrutiny by the EC (Commission). Interestingly, TNT's subsequent acquisition by FedEx was cleared unconditionally. Comparing these two scenarios offers an interesting insight into which cases fall across the prohibition line and which don't,"" he said.The court is expected to rule in the coming months.

Those are ""important reasons we’re winning and expanding margins,"" he said.Ecommerce poses a conundrum for package delivery firms because it costs more to deliver often just a single box to a home.

""But if this thing gets long drawn out and real complicated, that never helps anything.""The CEO of the world's largest package delivery company said the referendum result will have no impact on UPS's five-year, $2 billion expansion in the EU, set to end in 2019, including investments in the UK. On a daily basis, UPS moves an estimated 2 percent of global gross domestic product in its network.""Hopefully this thing doesn't have any real effect on the overall economy,"" he said, ""but we're just going to have to let things sort themselves out.""  During the campaign ahead of the UK's June 23 referendum, UPS was one of many companies that argued that continued EU membership was in the country's economic interest.Abney said that he believes the best opportunity for Congress to pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership, one of the world's biggest multinational trade deals, will be during the lame-duck session after the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8. Abney also said that during recent visits to China and Mexico he has heard concerns about the rhetoric on international trade that has come up frequently in both the Republican and Democratic campaigns for the U.S. presidency. ""There is a core group of Republicans and Democrats that support trade, and the present administration is pushing it,"" Abney said. ""I can't put odds on it, but we remain optimistic that it will be discussed and we're going to give it our full support."" ""The thing that's concerning is that other countries can take some of these things very literally and then they start to wonder if the U.S. values the relationship,"" he said. ""So when I travel to China and Mexico do you hear concerns? You absolutely do."" Abney said that UPS's focus for this year's crucial pre-holiday peak season will be to work more closely with retailers to manage ecommerce flows. He said collaboration with customers was key to success ahead of Christmas 2015. ""This year we're going to increase that collaboration even more,"" he said. ""We've got our systems connected to our customers even more and we've added capacity.""

U.S. District Judge Margo Brodie on Tuesday denied UPS's motion for summary judgment rejecting the Atlanta-based delivery giant's argument that the EEOC's delay of nearly 10 years between the initial filing of a worker's administrative charge and the agency's commencement of the lawsuit was unreasonable and damaged its ability to oppose the claims.

180,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) reported a higher quarterly net profit on Friday that met analyst expectations as revenue grew across its business units, and the company reaffirmed its full-year earnings outlook despite global economic uncertainty.Chief Executive David Abney told Reuters UPS is adding capacity to its network and will work more closely with retailers ahead of this year's crucial holiday peak season. The company had put in a solid a performance during the 2015 peak season after two years of struggling to handle holiday demand and the costs associated with it.""We think it's going to be a repeat of last year,"" Abney said. ""We just have more tools in our toolbox this year.""Often seen as a bellwether of U.S. economic activity, UPS revenue at its core U.S. domestic package business rose 2.4 percent on the year to just over $9 billion. Lower fuel costs and technology improvements helped UPS cut costs by 0.2 percent per package in the second quarter.Like other package delivery companies, UPS has benefited from a rapid rise in ecommerce, but has also struggled to bring down the extra costs associated with making stops at individual residential addresses rather than at businesses.  UPS, a long-standing proponent of free trade, reiterated concerns over anti-trade rhetoric in this year's U.S. presidential election, arguing that U.S. businesses benefit from trade deals.""It's not big companies that benefit; small and medium-sized enterprises need to compete and trade deals can make all the difference in the world to them,"" Abney told Reuters.UPS said second-quarter margins at its more lucrative international package business were boosted by volume growth, strong pricing and improved network efficiency gains.  The package delivery company posted second-quarter net income of $1.27 billion, or $1.43 per share, up more than 3 percent from $1.23 billion, or $1.35 per share, a year earlier. Analysts had, on average, expected earnings per share for the quarter of $1.43. Total revenue grew nearly 4 percent to $14.63 billion, from $14.1 billion in the second quarter of 2015. Analysts expected quarterly revenue of $14.62 billion.  UPS reiterated its 2016 full-year profit outlook, expecting  earnings per share in a range of $5.70 to $5.90.The company was optimistic of meeting that target despite continued softening of the U.S. economy, thanks to investments in improving network efficiency.UPS shares were down 1 percent at $107.69 in morning trading.

Royal Mail said in a statement that its GLS unit was under investigation, but did not elaborate on the allegations.FedEx said in an emailed statement that it has been notified by Spanish authorities of the investigation, but did not provide details. A UPS spokeswoman said the company was aware of the investigation but had no comment. Reuters was not immediately able to reach a Deutsche Post representative for comment, while DHL did not immediately respond to an emailed request.

195,"   By Nick Carey | LOUISVILLE, Ky.  LOUISVILLE, Ky. United Parcel Service plans to expand its 3D printing service to Asia and Europe, the U.S. shipping company has told Reuters, in a bid to fully embrace and get ahead of a trend that threatens to eat away a small but lucrative part of its business. Aside from its main package delivery service, UPS gets an undisclosed portion of its revenue from storing and shipping parts for manufacturers. If those customers were to switch to 3D printing their own parts, that business would face a drastic reduction.To counter that threat, UPS has chosen to get on board the 3D revolution, and is now looking to offer a service in which UPS will print out plastic parts - anything from nozzles to brackets to prototype soap dispensers or multi-faceted moving parts - around the world and deliver them.""3D printing is a great opportunity for us, but it's also a threat,"" Alan Amling, UPS vice president for corporate strategy, told Reuters.The dynamic - welcoming rather than fighting a threatening new technology - is not unlike automakers such as Toyota Motor Corp and Volkswagen AG teaming up with ride-hailing services Uber and Gett, respectively.Amling said UPS is looking at either Singapore or Japan for an Asian 3D printing factory. He did not say where the company might open a European facility, though UPS's operational hub in Europe is in Cologne, Germany.UPS has already got into the business in its home market. In May, it launched a U.S.-based 3D printing service with Fast Radius, a 3D printing company based outside Atlanta, where UPS is headquartered. UPS bought an unspecified stake in Fast Radius, which has a 3D printing factory at UPS's Louisville, Kentucky, hub. There are also now 3D printers at 60 UPS stores in the United States that print parts using industrial grade thermoplastics. Customers can upload images for printing at the Fast Radius factory or at one of those UPS stores and have the printed products shipped to any location.HOW IT WORKS  A 3D printer works by laying down successive levels of material, mostly plastics at this point, to create an object. Quality printers that make metal parts cost over $500,000, while printers that use thermoplastics can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Prices are expected to come down as the technology advances.While 3D printing is still slow compared to high-speed production lines, the technology has progressed so it can be used effectively for prototypes or some components that are not needed in high volumes. Larger firms such as General Electric Co are incorporating 3D-printed parts into production.That progress is a mixed blessing for UPS. As the cost of 3D printers drops and processes improve, that could undermine UPS's efforts to develop 3D printing as a service - because customers could buy just buy their own printers.""Why wait a day for a part to arrive (from UPS) when you'll be able to innovate six times a day on your own?"" said Richard D'Aveni, a professor of strategy at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College.A QUIET CORNER  What Fast Radius calls its ""digital manufacturing factory"" is a quiet operation occupying space in a corner of the UPS building in Louisville, without any of the grime, noise or bustle associated with a standard factory. Instead, a handful of machines work noiselessly, printing parts of varying sizes and shapes. During a recent visit to the operation by Reuters, Fast Radius CEO Rick Smith said that because of 3D printing, manufacturing is about to transform from ""being about where it's made to where it's needed."" One of the printers was close to completing a black plastic prototype hydraulic pump for a manufacturing customer in Germany - a process that takes about 72 hours. Smith said the job illustrates the need for UPS to expand its service beyond the United States.      Another customer, action camera maker GoPro Inc, is making use of Fast Radius' printers, coupled with UPS's ability to deliver a prototype the next day.Previously, if GoPro wanted to try out new designs, it would take weeks or even months to make a mock-up, senior GoPro product designer Ryan Harrison said. Now the company can innovate much quicker. ""3D printing allows you to fail quicker or to stumble on moments of genius,"" Harrison said.   BRACING FOR DISRUPTION      UPS does not break out how much it makes from its supply chain services, including warehouse storage. But in 2015 it reported about $6 billion in ""forwarding and logistics"" revenue, or about 10 percent of its total sales. An unknown portion of that came from its warehousing operations.UPS's biggest rival, FedEx Corp, is less focused on supply-chain services and has not dipped into 3D printing. But  if UPS succeeds, analysts said, FedEx could follow suit. The company declined to comment on 3D printing.  German competitor DHL, a unit of Deutsche Post AG, issued a report earlier this year warning the technology could upend traditional mass-production manufacturing, in which goods are shipped around the world. UPS's foray into 3D printing is not its first experiment in other disruptive industries. In October 2015, it invested in drone maker CyPhy Works, and this February bought a stake in same-day delivery company Deliv - in both instances to understand and harness potentially industry-shaking technologies.Morningstar analyst Keith Schoonmaker said while 3D printing has not yet proved itself on a mass scale, it makes sense for UPS to incorporate a technology ""that could supplement or replace its services.""

197,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK  NEW YORK New York state and city authorities took United Parcel Service Inc to trial on Monday, urging a federal judge to make the company pay more than $872 million for making illegal deliveries of more than 683,000 cartons of untaxed cigarettes.The non-jury trial before a federal judge in Manhattan came in a lawsuit by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and New York City as part of the state's ongoing efforts to combat smuggling of cigarettes from lower-tax areas.Lilia Toson, a lawyer for the city, told U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in her opening statement that UPS repeatedly ignored red flags that many of its shipments from American Indian reservations contained untaxed cartons of cigarettes.""The evidence will show a sufficiently large number of contraband shipments to suggest that UPS is turning a blind eye,"" Toson said. She urged the judge to appoint a monitor to ensure UPS's compliance with the law, and argued the world's largest package delivery company should be forced to pay over $872 million in penalties and damages.The size of the potential penalties appeared to catch UPS's lawyers off-guard. Carrie Cohen, an attorney for UPS, complained the state had given it no notice that was the potential figure, having only previously said damages could be $180 million. Cohen urged Forrest to reject the state and city's ""misleading"" allegations, as the evidence would should it complied with the law and that authorities had mistaken cartons of legally shippable ""little cigars"" as cigarettes.""The plaintiffs' case is devoid of evidence that UPS knew it was delivering cigarettes,"" she said. Filed in February 2015, the lawsuit contends that since 2010, UPS illegally shipped over 683,000 cartons of untaxed cigarettes mostly from smoke shops situated on Indian reservations throughout New York state.The deliveries to residences, unlicensed wholesalers and unlicensed retailers were made despite a 2005 agreement between UPS and New York in which the company agreed to stop cigarette shipments to consumers and unlicensed dealers, the lawsuit said.The lawsuit followed a similar case the state and city against FedEx Corp, accusing it of similarly illegally delivering contraband cigarettes to people's homes.

198,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK  NEW YORK New York state and city authorities took United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) to trial on Monday, urging a federal judge to make the company pay more than $872 million for making illegal deliveries of more than 683,000 cartons of untaxed cigarettes.The non-jury trial before a federal judge in Manhattan came in a lawsuit by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and New York City as part of the state's ongoing efforts to combat smuggling of cigarettes from lower-tax areas.Lilia Toson, a lawyer for the city, told U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in her opening statement that UPS repeatedly ignored red flags that many of its shipments from American Indian reservations contained untaxed cartons of cigarettes.""The evidence will show a sufficiently large number of contraband shipments to suggest that UPS is turning a blind eye,"" Toson said.She urged the judge to appoint a monitor to ensure UPS's compliance with the law, and argued the world's largest package delivery company should be forced to pay over $872 million in penalties and damages.

""The plaintiffs' case is devoid of evidence that UPS knew it was delivering cigarettes,"" she said.Filed in February 2015, the lawsuit contends that since 2010, UPS illegally shipped over 683,000 cartons of untaxed cigarettes mostly from smoke shops situated on Indian reservations throughout New York state.The deliveries to residences, unlicensed wholesalers and unlicensed retailers were made despite a 2005 agreement between UPS and New York in which the company agreed to stop cigarette shipments to consumers and unlicensed dealers, the lawsuit said.

202,"  (Repeats to additional subscribers with no changes to text)By Nick CareyLOUISVILLE, Ky., Sept 19 United Parcel Service  plans to expand its 3D printing service to Asia and Europe, the U.S. shipping company has told Reuters, in a bid to fully embrace and get ahead of a trend that threatens to eat away a small but lucrative part of its business.Aside from its main package delivery service, UPS gets an undisclosed portion of its revenue from storing and shipping parts for manufacturers. If those customers were to switch to 3D printing their own parts, that business would face a drastic reduction.To counter that threat, UPS has chosen to get on board the 3D revolution, and is now looking to offer a service in which UPS will print out plastic parts - anything from nozzles to brackets to prototype soap dispensers or multi-faceted moving parts - around the world and deliver them.""3D printing is a great opportunity for us, but it's also a threat,"" Alan Amling, UPS vice president for corporate strategy, told Reuters.The dynamic - welcoming rather than fighting a threatening new technology - is not unlike automakers such as Toyota Motor Corp and Volkswagen AG teaming up with ride-hailing services Uber and Gett, respectively.Amling said UPS is looking at either Singapore or Japan for an Asian 3D printing factory. He did not say where the company might open a European facility, though UPS's operational hub in Europe is in Cologne, Germany.UPS has already got into the business in its home market. In May, it launched a U.S.-based 3D printing service with Fast Radius, a 3D printing company based outside Atlanta, where UPS is headquartered. UPS bought an unspecified stake in Fast Radius, which has a 3D printing factory at UPS's Louisville, Kentucky, hub.There are also now 3D printers at 60 UPS stores in the United States that print parts using industrial grade thermoplastics. Customers can upload images for printing at the Fast Radius factory or at one of those UPS stores and have the printed products shipped to any location. HOW IT WORKS A 3D printer works by laying down successive levels of material, mostly plastics at this point, to create an object. Quality printers that make metal parts cost over $500,000, while printers that use thermoplastics can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Prices are expected to come down as the technology advances.While 3D printing is still slow compared to high-speed production lines, the technology has progressed so it can be used effectively for prototypes or some components that are not needed in high volumes. Larger firms such as General Electric Co  are incorporating 3D-printed parts into production.That progress is a mixed blessing for UPS. As the cost of 3D printers drops and processes improve, that could undermine UPS's efforts to develop 3D printing as a service - because customers could buy just buy their own printers.""Why wait a day for a part to arrive (from UPS) when you'll be able to innovate six times a day on your own?"" said Richard D'Aveni, a professor of strategy at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College. A QUIET CORNER What Fast Radius calls its ""digital manufacturing factory"" is a quiet operation occupying space in a corner of the UPS building in Louisville, without any of the grime, noise or bustle associated with a standard factory.Instead, a handful of machines work noiselessly, printing parts of varying sizes and shapes. During a recent visit to the operation by Reuters, Fast Radius CEO Rick Smith said that because of 3D printing, manufacturing is about to transform from ""being about where it's made to where it's needed.""One of the printers was close to completing a black plastic prototype hydraulic pump for a manufacturing customer in Germany - a process that takes about 72 hours. Smith said the job illustrates the need for UPS to expand its service beyond the United States. Another customer, action camera maker GoPro Inc, is making use of Fast Radius' printers, coupled with UPS's ability to deliver a prototype the next day.Previously, if GoPro wanted to try out new designs, it would take weeks or even months to make a mock-up, senior GoPro product designer Ryan Harrison said. Now the company can innovate much quicker.""3D printing allows you to fail quicker or to stumble on moments of genius,"" Harrison said.BRACING FOR DISRUPTION UPS does not break out how much it makes from its supply chain services, including warehouse storage. But in 2015 it reported about $6 billion in ""forwarding and logistics"" revenue, or about 10 percent of its total sales. An unknown portion of that came from its warehousing operations.UPS's biggest rival, FedEx Corp, is less focused on supply-chain services and has not dipped into 3D printing. But  if UPS succeeds, analysts said, FedEx could follow suit. The company declined to comment on 3D printing.German competitor DHL, a unit of Deutsche Post AG , issued a report earlier this year warning the technology could upend traditional mass-production manufacturing, in which goods are shipped around the world.UPS's foray into 3D printing is not its first experiment in other disruptive industries. In October 2015, it invested in drone maker CyPhy Works, and this February bought a stake in same-day delivery company Deliv - in both instances to understand and harness potentially industry-shaking technologies.Morningstar analyst Keith Schoonmaker said while 3D printing has not yet proved itself on a mass scale, it makes sense for UPS to incorporate a technology ""that could supplement or replace its services.""

204,"   By Nick Carey and Nandita Bose  United Parcel Service Inc's launch this week of drone test flights simulating emergency medical-supply deliveries highlights a race for data to prove such deliveries can be performed safely. UPS's medical emergency at the Children's Island summer camp off the Massachusetts coast was fictional. But gathering data about the drone's flight and others like it is a vital part of a new effort to convince U.S. regulators to loosen the reins on using robotic aircraft for deliveries.UPS's test flight was handled by drone maker CyPhy Works, in which it owns a stake. ""The technology for drones is there and it's moving extremely fast,"" said CyPhy founder Helen Greiner. ""But it's also true that we need to prove we can operate them safely and reliably.""     The UPS-CyPhy test comes amid a burst of U.S. drone activity, including companies focusing on package delivery. Amazon.com Inc is focusing on tests abroad, but UPS and others want to win over the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, whose primary concern is safety. The Obama administration estimates the commercial drone industry could generate more than $82 billion for the U.S. economy and support up to 100,000 new jobs by 2025.The FAA's rules published on Aug. 29 dictate conditions for commercial drones. The aircraft must weigh under 55 pounds (25 kg), may not fly over people not involved in operations and must remain within the operator's line of sight. Drone makers, retailers and package delivery companies are now angling for waivers, largely to operate out of the line of sight, using small tests to collect data on everything from air speed to operating in bad weather and the frequency of accidents. To obtain an FAA waiver exempting them from certain rules, companies must spell out a business case and use data to prove their drones are safe.  Some drone proponents have chafed at how slowly the FAA has moved to regulate drones, said Logan Campbell, CEO of drone consulting firm Aerotas. ""The only way things could move more quickly is if everyone were to share their data,"" he said. ""But ... no one wants to lose their competitive edge so that's not going to happen.""An FAA spokeswoman said the agency grants waivers ""if we find the proposed operation can be safely conducted using risk mitigation strategies."" Ben Marcus, CEO of drone software provider AirMap, said the ""big burden is being shifted from regulators ... to actual operators and developers"" to demonstrate their technology can function safely.  STEP BY STEP The FAA's cautious approach has encouraged some companies to test package delivery drones overseas. Amazon is testing deliveries in the United Kingdom, where it can fly drones out of the line of sight. Since the FAA's most recent guidance, more is happening in the U.S. market. PrecisionHawk is developing a system enabling drones to detect objects in the air and on the ground to avoid collisions - technology that could help deliver packages.Vice President Tyler Collins said PrecisionHawk received an FAA waiver last month to operate out of the line of sight, based on years of data from crop inspections, as doing so would save farmers time and money.  Package delivery vehicles maker Workhorse Group has developed the HorseFly drone which launches from a vehicle's roof. In current testing, the driver must stand and watch the drone. CEO Steve Burns said Workhorse has applied for an FAA waiver in a few rural ZIP codes to allow the driver to continue his route while the drone is in the air. Once Workhorse proves its case, it will seek a waiver for more ZIP codes.Burns said the HorseFly costs only 2 cents per mile to operate versus package delivery vehicles, some of which get 5 miles to the gallon - making traditional vehicles far more expensive to run.""What we're doing is of interest to people who deliver things - we have their attention,"" Burns said. UPS is using drones to manage inventory in warehouses, as is Walmart Mart Stores Inc, which can also gather data. Adam Shaw, CEO of drone seller Maverick Drone Systems, has seen an uptick in company requests for drones to scan barcodes in warehouses.Fred Smith, CEO of FedEx Corp, UPS's main rival, said this week FedEx has robotics programs under way including drones, but declined to provide details.

205,"   By Nick Carey | BEVERLY, Mass., Sept 23  BEVERLY, Mass., Sept 23 United Parcel Service Inc said it began testing the use of drones for emergency deliveries of medical supplies this week with a flight in rural Massachusetts, which the company hopes will eventually lead to federal approval of drones as a regular delivery option.The test flight on Thursday was handled by CyPhy, a Danvers, Massachusetts-based drone maker in which UPS, the world's largest package delivery company, owns a stake.The drone delivered a small package from Beverly, located about 25 miles northeast of Boston, to Children's Island, a summer camp for children three miles off the Atlantic coast. The drone, painted brown and with a UPS logo on the front, made the journey in about 8 minutes.""This demonstrates a drone is the best and most efficient way to deliver a package in a medical emergency in a remote location,"" Helen Greiner, chief technology officer and founder of CyPhy, told Reuters. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) last month published rules that restrict the use of drones to within the line of sight of the operator.Mark Wallace, UPS senior vice president of global engineering, said the company hopes to persuade the FAA to allow UPS to expand on its tests and eventually offer emergency deliveries by drone as part of its services. Earlier this year UPS announced it was backing a start-up using drones in Rwanda to transport life-saving blood supplies and vaccines.Drones are seen as having great potential to deliver packages, once FAA concerns over safety have been addressed.Online retailer Amazon.com Inc has been testing drones in the United Kingdom, Canada and Denmark, while Wal-Mart Stores has been using them to manage inventory at warehouses.

214,"   By Alwyn Scott and Nick Carey | NEW YORK/CHICAGO  NEW YORK/CHICAGO United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) said on Thursday it ordered 14 Boeing (BA.N) 747-8 cargo jets, a deal worth $5.3 billion at list prices that potentially breathes new life into an aircraft Boeing had warned it might cancel.The UPS order, which includes options for 14 more of the hump-backed planes, reflects growing demand the freight company is seeing for air cargo after years of anemic growth, Chief Executive Officer David Abney said in an interview.""We have the demand and these aircraft will allow us to handle the demand on a very scheduled basis,"" he said as UPS reported third-quarter results. The purchase adds significantly to Boeing's order book at a time when it and rival Airbus (AIR.PA) have struggled to sell widebody aircraft.Slow sales of the 747-8, the latest version of the four-engine plane that first flew in 1969, prompted Boeing to recently cut production to six a year and to warn in July it might stop making the plane. Similar-sized two-engine planes that are more fuel efficient have largely eclipsed the 747's passenger mission. Sales have also slowed for Airbus' large four-engine A380 passenger jet.But the 747-8 freighter's special hinged nose gives it a unique ability to carry large cargo. Boeing has said it expects 747 demand to recover when air cargo traffic growth resumes and when a wave of older 747s are retired beginning around 2019. On Wednesday, Boeing predicted 4.2 percent annual growth in air cargo traffic over then next 20 years, driven largely by e-commerce traffic and express delivery in China. ""Markets linked to Asia will lead all other international markets in average air cargo growth,"" Boeing said, citing a need by 2035 for 550 large, 747-size freighters. UPS plans to use its 747-8s on important ""trunk routes... connecting Europe to Asia, Asia to the U.S.,"" Abney said.

234,"   By Robert Iafolla  United Parcel Service Inc violated federal labor law when it fired a driver in Pennsylvania for his union activities and criticism of the company on social media, a National Labor Relations judge in Washington D.C. ruled on Friday. Administrative Law Judge Geoffrey Carter rejected UPS' argument that it would have fired Robert Atkinson for his poor performance in the absence of his organizing and criticism, finding that the company's decisions were ""tainted"" by its unlawful goal of removing a vocal leader and union activist from the workplace.

235,"   By Nick Carey and Nandita Bose | ADDISON, Ill.  ADDISON, Ill. In an unassuming building in the Chicago suburb of Addison, United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) engineers design custom boxes for retailers as part of a joint effort to tackle a vexing issue: the high cost of delivering e-commerce packages. Online retail sales are expected to reach $392.5 billion this year, according to research firm eMarketer, but with U.S. consumers now demanding free shipping on most packages, shippers and retailers are facing a squeeze. Shippers' margins are falling or stagnating, despite steady price increases, because homes are roughly three times as expensive to deliver to as business addresses. And retailers cannot pass along the cost, because they must offer free shipping in order to compete.The shared solution: design new, space-saving packages that can help improve package density on delivery trucks. This cuts costs for retailers and raises margins for shippers. Up to 60 percent of requests handled by UPS's package laboratory are for smaller packages to cut shipping rates, the company told Reuters.""In most cases we are able to get retailers a better rate,"" says Quint Marini, who runs the lab. The average rate reduction is around 20 percent, he said. Main rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N) has a similar facility in Memphis.The UPS lab puts new packaging through rigorous tests, piling weights on boxes, then simulating the jolts of a delivery truck traversing a bumpy road. On a recent morning, the load was too much for a box containing a furniture shipment, spilling weights over the floor as it collapsed. ""If the box can't hold the weights, we'll have to fail this one,"" said Jonathon McWherter, a UPS engineer conducting the test. RATES UP, MARGINS NOT      The stakes are growing. E-commerce shipments accounted for 46 percent of UPS's total volume last year, up from 36 percent in 2009. UPS expects the e-commerce share to hit 51 percent by 2019.  To counter rising costs, UPS and FedEx have raised package rates by between 4.9 percent and 5.9 percent annually since 2009. They also have levied surcharges on retailers for residential addresses and rural deliveries. Rates for a 5-pound (2.3-kg) box traveling up to 1,400 miles (2250 km) by UPS Ground or FedEx Home Delivery have nearly doubled since 2006, to $14.18, according to SJ Consulting Group.Despite the increases, profit margins at UPS and FedEx's U.S. domestic business have stagnated or declined in recent years, in part because they have invested billions of dollars to handle rising volumes. (See a graphic of UPS and FedEx's rates and margins here tmsnrt.rs/2h1ig9u)UPS and FedEx have sought new ways to cut costs, such as dropping batches of packages at urban retailers, where customers can retrieve them. Now they are focusing more on packaging, charging a fee for design services while also levying what they call 'dimensional weight' surcharges for boxes that take up too much room in relation their weight.   Retailers are hemmed in by their need to match Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). The world's largest online retailer offers free shipping to customers who pay a $99 annual fee to join its Amazon Prime program — a revenue stream most retailers have not been able to replicate. ""Amazon has forced everybody into free shipping,"" said John Haber, head of logistics consultancy Spend Management Experts. Amine Khechfe, co-founder of Endicia, which provides shipping services to e-commerce companies, said retailers are squeezed. ""They've got the pressures of free shipping, which isn't really free, and their costs are going up,"" he said.'CONSUMERS DON'T CARE WHAT IT COSTS'  Many retailers have responded by procuring 'on-demand' packaging machines, which custom-tailor shipping boxes. Hanko Kiessner, CEO of Packsize International, which makes such machines and the software that drives them, estimates 16 percent of U.S. retailers are using on-demand machines, and predicts a majority will do so within three years. Packaging ""is now front and center and a glaring opportunity for improvement,"" Kiessner said. Packsize also collaborates on projects with UPS.Office supply retailer Staples Inc (SPLS.O) said it has cut the weight of corrugated cardboard it uses in packaging by 65 percent, but declined to detail the cost savings.Car accessory and electronics retailer Crutchfield Corp has saved several million dollars with on-demand packaging since August 2014, chief fulfillment officer Chris Groseclose said. Companies like Monster Moto have worked with the UPS lab. The mini-bike maker has cut shipping costs up to 50 percent on bikes that sell for between $249 to $749, said CEO Alex Keechle.""That was a real expense to us, and because of free shipping, we had to eat it,"" he said.SJ Consulting founder Satish Jindel said retailers need to seek cost savings while also finding ways to pass on costs, such as minimum orders or membership fees.""Any retailer who wants to be an e-commerce player and thinks consumers will have to recognize that shipping costs money and they need to pay for it, will be out of business,"" Jindel said. ""The consumer doesn't care what it costs.""
