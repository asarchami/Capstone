0,"   By Deena Beasley  Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc on Thursday said a combination of its cystic fibrosis drug Kalydeco and an experimental compound was shown to improve lung function in a mid-stage trial, sending its shares up nearly 8 percent.The study found that treatment with Kalydeco and the experimental drug VX-661 for 28 days resulted in a 4.6 percentage point improvement in mean lung function for patients with two specific genetic mutations.VX-661 would be the second drug from Vertex that works by treating the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis, a rare genetic disease that impairs the lungs and digestive system.The disease is caused by defective or missing CF transmembrane conductane regulator (CFTR) proteins. Kalydeco is designed for patients with the most common CFTR mutation, while VX-661 aims to treat patients with a different mutation that affects protein function.The Phase 2 trial involved patients with both mutations who were already taking Kalydeco. ""It is good data and some believe it does have an incremental positive read-through to the all-important Phase 3 data later this summer,"" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee.That trial will answer the question of whether a combination of Vertex drugs is effective in patients with two copies of the gene mutation not currently addressed by Kalydeco - a market representing about half of the 30,000 cystic fibrosis patients in the United States.A positive result ""would be transformative to the cystic fibrosis community,"" Yee said. The most common side effects seen during the Phase 2 trial included cough, headache and upper respiratory tract infection.But ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum cautioned that Vertex has not disclosed results from the mid-stage trial for patients treated with a placebo.Vertex also announced that first quarter sales of Kalydeco totaled $100 million, which fell short of the average analyst estimate of $107 million, according to Wells Fargo Securities. Separately, The company reported an adjusted first quarter loss of $1.00 per share, also below the average analyst per-share loss estimate of 67 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Vertex said it would discontinue research into treatments for hepatitis C, a market now dominated by sales of Gilead Sciences Inc's Sovaldi. Vertex late last year sold off its non-North America royalty rights to hepatitis C drug Incivek.Shares of Vertex, which closed at $68.95 in regular Nasdaq trading, were up $5.30 at $74.25 after hours.

The combination also led to small but statistically significant increases in body mass index. That is viewed as a beneficial as CF patients have trouble gaining weight.Kalydeco (ivacaftor) and lumacaftor address the underlying cause of CF rather than just symptoms of the disease, in which a missing or defective protein called CFTR results in poor flow of salt and water into and out of cells in the lungs. That causes a buildup of thick, sticky mucus that can lead to chronic lung infections, progressive lung damage and death at an early age.The two studies involved a total of about 1,100 patients with each trial having two active treatment dosing regimens and a placebo group.Among those who received the combination, 4.2 percent dropped out due to adverse side effects compared with a 1.6 percent dropout rate in the placebo group.

Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges said the expanded approval could add about $160 million to annual Kalydeco sales and 50 cents to 55 cents in earnings per share. Kalydeco was the first drug approved that addresses the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis rather than just the symptoms of the life threatening disease. It helps improve breathing by clearing mucus from the airways.Vertex is testing other drugs in combination with Kalydeco in hopes of being able to treat a larger portion of the CF population, which affects about 75,000 people in North America, Europe and Australia.Vertex shares rose 1.6 percent to $109.95 in extended trading from their Nasdaq close at $108.16.

15,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, November 21 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of RPI  Finance Trust (RPI FT), including the 'BBB-' Issuer Default Rating (IDR),  following the acquisition of royalty-bearing assets linked to Vertex  Pharmaceutical Inc.'s (Vertex) cystic fibrosis treatment Kalydeco. The rating  action applies to approximately $3.3 billion of debt outstanding as of Sept. 30,  2014. The Rating Outlook is Stable.  A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release.   KEY RATING DRIVERS -- The acquisition of certain rights to the Kalydeco franchise for $3.3 billion,  while leveraging, is consistent with RPI FT's strategy to invest in long-term  attractive royalty-bearing assets. The purchase mitigates pressure on revenues  as patents lapse for pharmaceuticals that underlie nearly 32% of the company's  royalty stream over the next three years.  -- As a result of the transaction, Fitch expects debt leverage (total debt to  EBITDA) to rise to 4.5x at the end of 2014 from below 2.5x currently. Absent  further-leveraging asset purchases, Fitch sees leverage dropping to below 4x in  2015 and 3x in 2016 driven by a combination of EBITDA growth and rapid debt  reduction facilitated by an excess cash flow recapture provision in the  company's credit facilities.    -- A new investment horizon is approaching and it is expected that by the end of  2015, RPI FT's structure may once again change. It is unknown whether another  division in assets may occur akin to 2011, but initial work toward addressing  the event will likely begin over the near term. RATING SENSITIVITIES An upgrade is unlikely for RPI FT given the company's business strategy is  reliant on active asset purchasing that can stretch leverage to a level no  longer consistent with the current 'BBB-' rating. Uncertainty surrounding the  approaching investment event in 2015 also limits ratings upside.   A downgrade would result from an intention to completely wind down the  royalty-bearing assets, most probable during the investment event, expected to  occur in 2015. A fall in cash flows such that the anticipated total no longer  matches the outstanding debt level would pressure the rating as well. In  addition, downward action would result from an inability or unwillingness to  reduce high debt leverage rapidly following leveraging asset acquisitions. Portfolio life extended by acquisition: Fitch's concern about patent expirations of pharmaceuticals over the next few  years that drive RPI FT's revenues has been addressed by the addition of rights  to the Kalydeco franchise, including developmental projects, as well as  higher-than-expected milestone payments related to sales of Biogen IDEC Inc.'s  multiple sclerosis medicine Tecfidera.  Maturing drugs over the next three years  represented 32% of the company's royalty stream at the end of 2013. Fitch now  sees mid-double-digit revenue and earnings increases over the ratings horizon.  The transaction also increased the average weighted life of the company's  royalty-bearing asset portfolio to around 11 years from eight years.  Leverage temporarily increases: RPI FT's debt leverage will rise to 4.5x at the end of 2014 from approximately  2.3x currently, in conjunction with incremental debt needed to fund the recent  $3.3 billion acquisition. Fitch believes that gross debt leverage will quickly  fall to below 4x in 2015 and below 3x in 2016 driven by debt paydown required by  excess free cash flow recapture in the company's secured term loan B facilities.  The provision calls for 50% or 25% of excess cash flow to be applied to debt  reduction if gross leverage is above or below 3.5x, respectively.  Investment event nearing: An investment event dictated by RPI FT's guidelines must take place in 2015 or  all investment activity will cease. The strategy for the prior event in 2011  resulted in a split (a highly lengthy process) of Royalty Pharma into two new  finance subsidiaries: Royalty Pharma Investments (RPI) and Royalty Pharma Select  (RP Select). It is unknown whether another division in assets may occur, but  initial work toward addressing the event will begin in the near term. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings of RPI FT: --IDR at 'BBB-'; --Senior secured bank loan rating at 'BBB-'.

The disease currently affects 70,000 people worldwide.Kalydeco treats certain underlying genetic mutations behind cystic fibrosis (CF), while Resunab aims to manage the inflammation the disease causes.""We're not focusing on a particular subset of patients, like Vertex's drug,"" Chief Executive Yuval Cohen said.Kalydeco, which was granted fast-track status by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, received approval in 2012, six years after the company started an early stage trial.Kalydeco, which had sales of about $464 million in 2014, is being tested in combination with other drugs to expand its use. It is expected to generate peak sales of $1.1 billion in 2020, according to Thomson Reuters Cortellis.Resunab could bring in more than $2 billion in U.S. sales treating CF patients, Zacks Investment Research analyst Jason Napodano said.Still, Corbus has a long way to go. ""It's too soon to know how significant Resunab will be ...,"" said a CF Foundation spokeswoman.CF is caused by a missing or defective gene that makes the body produce a thick, sticky mucus resulting in inflammation and bacterial infections. This then causes ""abnormal inflammation,"" which leads to fibrosis, and, eventually, death.""Theoretically, we're targeting all CF patients, because the one thing that all these mutations share is that every single one of them exhibits abnormal inflammation,"" Cohen said. Cohen had helped develop five anti-inflammatory drug candidates as co-founder of Celsus Therapeutics Plc.Since Resunab aims to bring down the abnormal inflammation by mimicking a natural process, Cohen expects it will have a ""good safety profile"". Existing anti-inflammatory drugs are typically associated with serious side-effects and suppress the immune system.Resunab is also being tested to treat scleroderma, an inflammatory skin disorder.

18,"  * FDA slated to make decision on treatment on July 5* Analysts say they still expect approval* Vertex's stock up 1.7 pct in afternoon trade   (Recasts, adds details; updates shares)By Natalie Grover and Vidya L NathanMay 8 Staff reviewers from the U.S. FDA questioned whether Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc's  experimental combination therapy for cystic fibrosis had an added benefit over the company's already approved therapy, Kalydeco, in patients with the most common genetic mutation behind the deadly disease.Vertex's combination of Kalydeco and an experimental compound called lumacaftor was tested against a placebo in patients aged 12 and above with a type of genetic mutation known as F508del, carried by about half of all CF patients. Kalydeco is not currently approved to treat this mutation.If the combination, Orkambi, is approved, Vertex will be eligible to treat about 8,500 patients in the United States, up from the 2,000 Kalydeco currently addresses, said Zachry Barber, the company's senior director of corporate communications.The FDA is slated to make a decision on Orkambi by July 5. U.S. Food and Drug Administration reviewers noted Orkambi's ""relatively small"" treatment effect, but said they were satisfied with its safety profile, in briefing documents released on Friday, (1.usa.gov/1ceMWB6)The combination was tested against a placebo, rather than against its individual components as is typically the case, the reviewers said.This raises the question of whether lumacaftor contributes any added benefit over Kalydeco as a standalone drug, as well as whether Kalydeco by itself has a positive effect on the patient population, they said. Analysts said they still expect the FDA to approve the drug.CF is caused by a missing or defective gene that makes the body produce a thick, sticky mucus resulting in inflammation and recurrent bacterial infections. Most patients die in their mid-twenties.Patients must take a cocktail of vitamins, painkillers and antibiotics to maintain daily functioning. The disease affects about 30,000 people in the United States.A panel of independent advisers to the FDA will make a recommendation on Orkambi on Tuesday. The agency typically follows the panel's recommendations.Vertex's stock was up 1.2 percent in afternoon trading. The shares rose as much as 5 percent to a session high of $131.42 earlier.

The FDA usually follows the recommendations of its advisory panels but does not have to.""Is the drug going to be approved?

Vertex estimates that Orkambi would initially be used to treat about 8,500 patients with the F508del mutation, or 28 percent of U.S. cystic fibrosis sufferers. Kalydeco, the first medicine to address the underlying cause of CF rather than just symptoms, is currently used to treat about 2,000 patients who suffer from a different mutation.  Worldwide, there are an estimated 70,000 CF patients, about half of whom have the F508del mutation Orkambi is designed to treat.    Those patients who were not eligible for Kalydeco are currently treated with a cocktail of vitamins, pain killers and antibiotics to maintain daily functions.Before reaching its final decision, a divided panel was unable to say that lumacaftor had a positive effect when used in  combination with Kalydeco because the data was insufficient to demonstrate the efficacy of Orkambi's separate components.     Agency staff offered a mixed review of the combination last week, raising questions about whether it had an added benefit over Kalydeco alone.The committee also heard compelling and often tearful public testimony from nearly two dozen CF patients, their relatives and advocates, who pleaded that it recommend Orkambi on the hope the treatment could slow or even reverse progression of the disease for some.

Cystic fibrosis is caused by defects in the CFTR gene that disrupts the function of the lungs and digestive system, producing a build-up of thick, sticky mucus leading to inflammation and recurrent bacterial infections.Half of the people with cystic fibrosis live longer than 28 years, according to the World Health Organization.(bit.ly/1OqUj6Z) Kalydeco, which brought in revenue of $632 million in 2015, is already approved to treat CF patients aged 2 and older with 10 different mutations in the CFTR gene.The company was exploring the use of the drug in the group of 23 residual function mutations, also known to carry the CFTR protein.Vertex said it had filed for an application based on studies of these mutations in preclincal trials and an exploratory mid-stage study.The FDA informed Vertex that it cannot approve the application in its present form. The company said it would meet with the regulator to determine the path forward.

31,"  LONDON, March 23 A new cystic fibrosis treatment from Vertex Pharmaceuticals has been rejected as too expensive by Britain's healthcare cost agency NICE.The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) said on Wednesday that Orkambi, priced at an annual 104,000 pounds ($149,000) per patient, was not a cost-effective use of state healthcare resources, even though it offers clinical benefits. Vertex said it believed the evaluation process used by NICE in reaching its draft decision was not appropriate for rare diseases like cystic fibrosis, as it did not take into account the full benefits that medicines like Orkambi could offer. Cystic fibrosis is caused by a genetic defect that causes the lungs and digestive system to become clogged with sticky mucus. There is currently no cure.

36,"   By Carl O'Donnell and Ransdell Pierson  Medivation's MDVN.O $14 billion sale to U.S. drug giant Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) for a hefty premium, the largest U.S. biotechnology acquisition so far this year, had investors on Monday speculating about more dealmaking in the sector.Shares of Incyte Corp (INCY.O) and Seattle Genetics (SGEN.O), rose as much as 11 percent and 4 percent, respectively. Incyte and Seattle Genetics, which have respective market capitalizations of $15.4 billion and $6.7 billion, focus on innovative cancer treatments and, like Medivation, are already producing revenue.For the other companies that also bid for Medivation, including Sanofi SA (SASY.PA), Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N), Celgene Corp (CELG.O) and Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O), such targets could serve as coveted consolation prizes.  Major drug makers are vying for a foothold in oncology because the sector promises to be among the single biggest contributors to sales growth over the next five years, according to data from consultancy Ernst and Young. Large pharmaceutical companies have been itching to make big deals all year. The most deal-hungry are wrestling with generic competition, or are rushing to gain a leadership position in a burgeoning therapeutic area, such as cancer or rare diseases. This acquisition drive could spell deals even for other promising biotechnology companies outside the oncology sector. Shares of BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc (BMRN.O) for example, a $16.7 billion market capitalization company that focuses on rare diseases, rose as much as 7 percent on takeover speculation.Pfizer's acquisition of Medivation for $81.50 per share in cash, represents a close to 120-percent premium to Medivation's stock price before Reuters reported on March 30 that the company was working with JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) to field takeover approaches.It is a rich valuation by most metrics. The deal values Medivation at 17.9 times its revenue, versus a 12.8 times average for deals in the sector in the last eight years, according to a research note by BMO Capital Markets.  The deal could be a much needed shot in the arm for dealmaking in the biotech sector, which has been tepid ever since the Nasdaq Biotech Index .NBI plunged more than 30 percent late last year, largely due to heightened political pressure on drug prices.So far this year, dealmaking activity in life sciences is down 64 percent from this time last year, according to data from Thomson Reuters.  But that could change as the corporate boards of mid-sized biotech companies, which have been hesitant to seriously consider a sale in a down market, are tempted by the prospect of juicy premiums, investors, analysts and investment bankers said.""Given the scarcity of mid-cap biotech, we believe the remaining companies could see increasing interest, as large pharma continues to look toward biotech as a source of growth,"" Do Kim, an analyst for BMO Capital Markets, wrote in his note.Other companies to watch for as possible acquisition targets include Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc (VRTX.O), Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc (ALXN.O), Neurocrine Biosciences Inc (NBIX.O) and Intercept Pharmaceuticals Inc (ICPT.O), Kim noted.

37,"  Sept 28 Vertex Pharamceuticals Inc said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration expanded the use of its cystic fibrosis drug to treat a new subgroup of patients with the rare genetic disorder.The company, however, cut its 2016 sales forecast for the drug, Orkambi, sending its shares down as much as 4 percent in after-market trading on Wednesday.Vertex cited a slower-than-anticipated launch in Germany and slower refills during July and August for the cut.The company said it now expects Orkambi revenue of $950 million to $990 million, down from $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion it had previously forecast. The FDA approved the use of Orkambi in children with cystic fibrosis aged 6-11 who have a type of the mutation. The drug is already approved for use in patients aged 12 and older with a similar mutation. ""(The) approval in people ages 6 through 11 will drive growth in the U.S. in the fourth quarter,"" the company said.Cystic fibrosis is a life-threatening condition, where a defective gene disrupts the function of the lungs and digestive system, producing a build-up of thick, sticky mucus leading to inflammation and recurrent bacterial infections. The company's shares recouped some of their losses to be down less than a percent in extended trading.
