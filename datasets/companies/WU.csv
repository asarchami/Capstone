0,"   By Neha Dimri  Western Union Co (WU.N) said it expects the high compliance costs that hit its earnings in the fourth quarter to ease in 2014, helping to push up the company's shares after the bell.The world's largest money-transfer company reported a 27 percent drop in quarterly profit, largely due higher costs linked to tightened regulations to prevent money laundering.""We expect (compliance) costs in 2014 to be 3.5 to 4 percent of our revenue ... That is (also) probably the pickable range for 2015,"" interim Chief Financial Officer Raj Agrawal told Reuters after the company announced results on Tuesday.Western Union said in October that it did not expect earnings growth in 2014 due to higher compliance costs, which it pegged at 3.5-4.5 percent of revenue.""The tighter range on compliance costs reflects management getting a somewhat better handle on how the new regulatory requirements will affect the company going forward,"" BTIG analyst Mark Palmer said.Western Union, which gets most of its business from migrant workers sending money home, said it expected earnings of $1.40 to $1.50 per share in 2014, based on low-to-mid-single digit percentage growth in revenue on a constant-currency basis. The guidance met expectations that were cut sharply after the company's comments accompanying its third-quarter results in October.Western Union, which also announced a $500 million share buyback, said it expected to be less aggressive with price cuts for its money-transfer products in 2014.Smaller rival Money Gram International Inc (MGI.O) reported a stronger-than-expected profit earlier on Tuesday, but warned of incremental compliance-related and restructuring costs.""We continue to view Western Union as well-positioned to take market share from competitors unable to adjust to the industry-wide compliance cost increases,"" Palmer said. PROFIT MISSES ESTIMATES Western Union has cut prices and invested heavily in its online and mobile businesses to better compete with fast-growing rivals such as MoneyGram, Xoom Corp XOOM.O and Boom Financial Inc.Agrawal said he did not expect Western Union to be as aggressive with price cuts as it was in 2013, although he added that ""if pricing is required to be adjusted we will do it."" Western Union's net income fell to $173.4 million, or 31 cents per share, in the quarter ended December 31, from $237.9 million, or 40 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue dropped marginally to $1.42 billion.Transaction volumes rose 9 percent to 64.19 million in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, while remittances increased to $21.5 billion from $20 billion.Analysts on average had expected the company to earn 32 cents per share on revenue of $1.43 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Western Union's stock had dropped about 18 percent up to Tuesday's close since the company's last quarterly results.The company's shares rose 2 percent in extended trading after closing at $15.88 on the New York Stock Exchange.(Editing by Ted Kerr)",2014-02-11,WU,"Tue Feb 11, 2014 | 6:57pm EST",Western Union sees lower regulatory expenses in 2014,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-westernunion-results-idUSBREA1A24A20140211?type=companyNews

7,"   By Phil Wahba  Wal-Mart Stores Inc is launching a money transfer service in a direct challenge to the dominance of Western Union Co. and MoneyGram, aiming to broaden the financial services it offers to low-income customers and increase store traffic.Wal-Mart said on Thursday that Euronet Worldwide Inc's Ria Money Transfer subsidiary would begin running the service, called ""Walmart-2-Walmart,"" next week.The new service, which Wal-Mart says will charge lower fees than those currently offered by competitors, will enable shoppers to send and receive cash from family members and friends at more than 4,000 U.S. discount stores.Wal-Mart, which will not offer the service online or in its international stores, hopes consumers will turn around and spend at least some of that money at the stores.Daniel Eckert, senior vice president of services for Walmart U.S., said Walmart-2-Walmart ""challenges the status quo and drives down prices.""After the news, Western Union shares were down 4 percent, while those of MoneyGram International Inc, which currently provides such services for Wal-Mart shoppers, plummeted 15.6 percent. Euronet was up 4.4 percent.""This significant foray casts a pall over Western Union's pricing model and long-term organic revenue growth outlook,"" Andrew Jeffrey, an analyst at SunTrust Robinson, said in a research note.For Western Union, U.S. domestic money transfer represents about 8 percent of its total 2013 revenue. When asked about the new Walmart service, Western Union said it was well-positioned in the business, saying it offered services through a network of about 46,000 agents in the United States alone.Sterne Agee analyst Jennifer Dugan said she thought the new Walmart service would not have a significant impact on Western Union's market share and average pricing.""We believe Western Union's agent locations in the U.S. are ... more convenient to the majority of those sending and receiving money transfers,"" she wrote in a research note.LITTLE ACCESS TO BANKING SERVICES  The new service is another effort to boost finance revenues from Wal-Mart customers, many of whom have little access to banking services, into stores that are experiencing declining traffic.According to a 2011 survey by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, 8.2 percent of U.S. households are ""unbanked"" and another 20.1 percent are ""underbanked,"" making money transfers an important personal finance tool for them.Walmart-2-Walmart customers can transfer up to $50 for a fee of $4.50, compared with between $4.75 and $5 at rival services, Wal-Mart said. Transferring $900 will cost $$9.50, compared with $73 via MoneyGram.""The bigger loser is MoneyGram as they have a bigger threat as they have 27 percent revenue that came from Walmart in 2013,"" said Rahul Agarwal at Guggenheim Partners. ""MoneyGram gets a quarter of their revenue through that agreement."" The Walmart service will limit customers to $900 in transfers a day; higher amounts would require the sender to provide much more information, adding a level of complexity that would compound costs, Eckert told Reuters, noting there will little demand anyway for transfers above $1,000.Consumers can still transfer money through MoneyGram. MoneyGram also facilitates online money transfers, while WalMart-2-Mart will strictly transfer cash from store to store.Western Union said its online domestic money transfer service was growing fast.Wal-Mart has long been interested in taking a bigger piece of the financial services market. It had applied for a bank charter but withdrew it in 2007 after opposition from banks and labor unions.Wal-Mart U.S. last year generated about 1 percent of annual sales from financial services such as money orders, prepaid cards, wire transfers, check cashing and bill payments, according to its latest annual report. The company offers those services at its Walmart MoneyCenter locations and customer service desks.Wal-Mart shares were up 0.6 percent to $77.70 in afternoon trading.(Reporting by Phil Wahba in New York.

16,"   By Patrick Graham | LONDON  LONDON Working out of a shared office near London's Euston station, Michael Kent is part of a revolution that may be driven on by this year's row over alleged currency market manipulation by major banks.Kent's online business, Azimo, and more than 30 others in the United Kingdom are building on the success of firms like Western Union (WU.N) and MoneyGram International (MGI.O) in carving out a chunk of the market in international money transfers, travel money and card payments.Their pitch is simple: in the era of electronic money, the 4-12 percent fees banks charge consumers for any transaction involving foreign currency is ludicrously expensive. Today, to transfer 100 pounds to Germany, British high street bank Halifax would charge 9.5 pounds and use a rate 3.06 eurocents per pound worse than those the financial world's biggest players charge each other, totaling around 12 percent. Halifax points to the costs of running secure, wide-ranging operations and says the percentage falls for larger amounts.Currency market majors HSBC and Barclays charge less and costs on foreign currency transactions on credit cards often go below 5 percent, but the fee at Azimo is 1 pound, the spread less than 1 cent, and the overall cost less than 2 percent.""This is money that the banks do not need to charge people and we just set out to change that,"" says Kent. ""We are in the middle of a worldwide downturn and these people are making supernormal profits. It is money people do not need to pay.""REPLAY Azimo's original raison d'etre was to reduce the cost for  migrant workers of sending money home by streamlining the sort of service Western Union or Moneygram International were already providing at cheaper rates than western banks.  Across London, in trendy e-business hub Shoreditch, market veterans Brian Jamieson and Daniel Butcher are seeking to take the game one stage further with another start-up, Centtrip.As financial markets went electronic in the 1990s, they were among entrepreneurs making the most of the large spreads banks charged companies for day-to-day currency purchases.Such firms helped drive corporate costs over interbank rates down from several cents to a few pips, or hundredths of a cent. Centtrip is now seeking to do the same for ordinary consumers.Customers sign up online, get sent a Mastercard and pay into it at a cost of 0.5 percent. They can then use the card for 14 currencies, with a spread of just 4 hundredths of a eurocent to interbank rates, compared to Halifax's 3 whole eurocents.Centtrip's initial target is business travelers, but Jamieson says it could take just five years for a mass audience of smart-phone users to clock on to the model.  One key ingredient, he says, is convincing households their money is as safe with small web-based firms as with their bank.""After what happened in 2008, we've got to the point where we have lost trust and faith in the banks,"" he says. ""That has opened up the door for people like us to disrupt the market.""Since the global financial crisis laid bare excessive risk-taking at banks, their reputation has suffered further from allegations traders fleeced their biggest clients by manipulating foreign exchange rates, though there is no suggestion of any manipulation of retail rates.UNDER THE RADAR  Banks do not break out their retail forex business in their results and there are no overall figures for the sector, but official data shows Britons spent $23.6 billion while on business and holiday trips abroad last year.Numbers from the Bank of International Settlements show global flows worth $78 billion a day through retail foreign exchange brokers, and $188 billion a day in flows from companies outside the financial sector, although much of that is from big multinationals going through their banks. ""If travel money is billions then the market in these ordinary bank transfers will be at least 100 times that,"" says Ian Strafford-Taylor, chief executive of one of the earliest players in the consumer space, FairFX.FairFX is worth just under 40 million pounds according to its listing on London's AIM market, and made almost 3 million pounds on revenues of more than 300 million last year.The relative size of the newcomers shows there is some way to go. Eesha Mohindra, analyst at consumer finance website Moneysavingexpert.com, said more transparency was needed. ""Without knowing it, most people waste big money when spending cash abroad by using the wrong card,"" she said. A handful of senior bank managers who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity said the challenge to them in the retail segment was under serious consideration for the first time, but it was not yet considered big enough to force widespread change in a market seen as more lucrative even than the United States.""Clearly some of the banks still see this as a captive client base and it is coming closer to that point where these sort of nimble startups will force us to change,"" said the head of electronic trading with one large European bank.""Banks are already investing in some of these companies. Then when they see that they are really succeeding, they will buy some of them out.""

39,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Paymap Inc, a unit of Western Union Co, agreed to pay $38.4 million to settle U.S. regulatory charges that it deceived consumers into signing up for a program advertised as a way to help them pay off their mortgages faster and save on interest payments.The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Tuesday said Paymap, a payment processor, will pay a $5 million civil fine, and return $33.4 million in fees to 125,000 consumers who had enrolled since July 2011 in the Equity Accelerator Program.LoanCare LLC, a residential mortgage servicer, will pay a related $100,000 civil fine. Neither company admitted or denied the CFPB's charges.The CFPB said Paymap and LoanCare advertised online, by mail and by phone that typical consumers who signed up for the Equity Accelerator Program would save more than $33,000 in interest by making mortgage payments biweekly rather than monthly. Instead, the program did not make the more frequent payments, and no more than a ""tiny"" percentage of enrollees realized the promised savings, the CFPB said.Consumers typically paid $295 to enroll in the program, and a $2.50 transaction fee for each debit, the CFPB said.

50,"  CAIRO Jan 12 Money transfers from Egypt to China via Western Union have been curbed in recent weeks to stop importers bypassing capital controls in place at Egyptian banks to manage a dollar shortage, banking and Western Union sources in Egypt said.The restriction is the latest measure taken in Egypt, which relies heavily on imports, to tackle a shortfall in hard currency needed to finance its purchases.The central bank has rationed dollars, giving priority to the import of essential goods over luxuries.To prevent importers from sourcing their dollar needs on the black market, the central bank has limited the amount of dollars companies are allowed to deposit in banks to $50,000 a month, making it harder to open letters of credit and clear cargoes. That has driven some importers to pay for purchases of cheap consumer goods from China via Western Union, a money wiring service typically used by low-wage expatriate workers in Egypt to remit salaries to their home countries.Two banking sources and two Western Union sources in Egypt said on Tuesday that a client could now transfer no more than $3,000 a day from Egypt to China via Western Union, down from a previous limit around $7,000. Calls to Western Union's head office in Egypt went unanswered. Western Union in Egypt transfers funds through the Arab African International Bank and Bank of Alexandria. ""There was an agreement with both banks and the company to lower the limit of daily dollar transfers to China to $3,000 instead of around $7,000 with the aim of lowering the arbitrary imports to Egypt,"" one of the banking sources said.""It is in the interest of the banks to transfer funds and benefit from the commission but they discovered that the transfers to China were made to import products and weren't regular transfers.""The limit to transfer through Western Union from Egypt to any other country is still around $7,000, the source added.

51,"  ASHGABAT Feb 1 Turkmenistan, hit hard by the slump in the price of energy and commodities, has limited the amount of money its citizens can send abroad through the popular Western Union money transfer service, transfer clerks said.The move follows an effective ban on the sales of cash foreign currency introduced last month as the Central Asian nation sticks to a fixed exchange rate, unlike its neighbours who have allowed sharp depreciations.Clerks at two Western Union agents in the Turkmen capital Ashgabat told a Reuters correspondent on Monday that under new regulations they were required to check the sender's payslips and make sure the transfer did not exceed his monthly pay. The central bank could not be reached for comments on Monday and has not published new regulations. Turkmenistan, whose main export is natural gas, devalued its manat currency by about 19 percent to 3.50 manats per dollar from Jan. 1, 2015, but other energy exporters have made bigger exchange rate adjustments. Neighbouring Kazakhstan, also an exporter of hydrocarbons, has allowed its currency, the tenge, to lose almost half its value against the dollar since last August.

The Commission is checking allegations that Western Union colluded with banks to drive out smaller rivals in the money transfer market, Bloomberg cited two unnamed sources as saying.Western Union said there was strong competition in the market coming from digital operators, mobile operators, mail and courier services, prepaid cards, travel cards as well as ATM transfers. The World Bank last year forecast a 0.4 percent rise in global money transfers to $586 billion for 2015 compared with a 4.1 percent increase this year to $610 billion.

68,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 28 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Long-Term Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured debt ratings of The Western Union Company  (Western Union) at 'BBB+' and the Short-Term IDR at 'F2'. The Rating Outlook is  Stable. See the full list of ratings at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Strong Competitive Position: Fitch believes Western Union operates from a strong  competitive position, particularly with regard to the receiving end of its  traditional cash-based remittance business. While there is some encroachment on  the money transfer business in the developed economies from mobile and digital  platforms, Western Union is investing in these platforms as well, and expanding  markets where it can make account-based deposits. Western Union is strongly  positioned as the largest provider with an extensive domestic and international  agent base. The company is the largest operator in a fragmented market, with  more than 500,000 agents located in 200 countries and territories. The company  has an approximate 15% share in the global remittance business, with its next  largest competitor having approximately one-fourth the revenues of Western  Union. Consumer-to-Consumer Segment: With approximately 79% of consolidated revenues,  this segment is Western Union's core business. At times, the company has  experienced greater price competition in the domestic money transfer business  related to higher principal amounts, and at times may take targeted pricing  actions where competitors have been active. For the past couple of years,  pricing pressures have not been as significant as in 2013. On an overall basis  revenues grew 3% in 2015 on a constant currency basis, the same as 2014. Volume  growth in 2015 decelerated to 3% from 5% in 2014. In 2013, revenues on a  constant currency basis declined 3% on 5% volume growth. New Payment Technologies: New payment technologies are challenging Western  Union's business in developed markets but are having a slower impact on the  traditional remittance services to developing countries. The company is  directing resources to compete in these areas, and has been expanding the forms  of remittance through digital and mobile platforms as technology advances and as  consumers adopt such platforms. For example, the company offers Apple Pay as a  means of funding global transfers in some markets and domestic bill payments. Foreign Currency Exposure: Given the broad diversification of the company's  revenue, foreign currency exposure is significant. The company's greatest  exposure is with settlements and this is largely eliminated by forward  contracts, and also by the fact that the majority of money transfer transactions  are paid the next day and agent settlements occur within a few days in most  instances. The company also hedges revenue to provide cash flow predictability.  The hedges only partly offset the revenue impact but have a much greater  offsetting impact to profits. Additionally, there are natural hedges in the cost  structure (commissions paid in local currencies) that protect the company's  profitability as a percentage of revenue. Compliance Costs: Compliance costs have risen over the past several years, from  approximately $60 million in 2011 to about $200 million in 2015. These costs are  largely unavoidable. Some compliance costs may be fixed, which may prove to be  an advantage for Western Union, given its scale. To partly offset compliance  cost increases, the company has been controlling costs by shifting certain  operations from higher cost areas to lower cost areas. Leverage Expectations: Fitch expects leverage to be approximately 2.3x and 2.2x  at year-end 2016 and 2017, respectively. At the current 'BBB+' rating the  company has moderate financial flexibility.  FCF: Western Union generates solid FCF (cash from operations less capex and  dividends), and Fitch expects FCF to decline to a range of $400 million to $450  million in 2016 from $488 million in 2015. Fitch expects a modest rise in  technology-related capital spending to just under $300 million, and there is the  potential for a $100 million tax settlement, which may fall partly or entirely  in 2016.  Capital Allocation: In February 2016, the company raised its dividend 3.2% (well  below the 24% increase the prior year). As of March 31, 2016, the company had  $472 million remaining on its $1.2 billion common share repurchase program  authorized in February 2015 (effective through December 2017). In 2015, Western  Union returned $817 million to shareholders. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Relatively flat revenue growth in 2016 and 2% for 2017. Western Union  experienced constant currency revenue growth of 4% in both 2014 and 2015, and  Fitch assumes a similar level in 2016. Constant currency revenue declined (1%)  in 2013 when aggressive pricing actions were taken. --The remaining payment of approximately $100 million on a settlement with the  IRS is included. The company has paid approximately $94 million of the $190  million settlement. --The EBITDA margin declines modestly in 2016, and Fitch assumes is rises  slightly in 2017 and beyond. --Capital spending reflects additional amounts in 2016 for technology-related  spending, and declines to a normal level of 4% of revenue thereafter. --Compliance costs range 3.5% to 4.0% in the forecast. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive Rating Action: Potential positive ratings drivers include a sustained  rebound in EBITDA margins coupled with high single-digit revenue growth over  several years, combined with leverage of approximately 2.0x. Negative Rating Action: Potential rating drivers that could negatively impact  the rating include the potential for Western Union to increase leverage above  2.5x to fund future acquisitions or shareholder-friendly actions. In addition,  the ratings could be downgraded if EBITDA profit margins decline further from  additional pricing pressures, which would suggest a more significant and  prolonged competitive challenge than is currently factored into the ratings. LIQUIDITY Strong Liquidity Profile: Liquidity as of March 31, 2016 was bolstered by cash  balances of $1.16 billion and availability on its $1.65 billion senior unsecured  revolving credit facility. Approximately $750 million was held by foreign  entities at March 31, 2016, down from $950 million at the end of 2015.  Repatriating foreign earnings would have tax consequences in many instances.  Offshore cash has been used to fund acquisitions outside the U.S. and to provide  initial funding of principal transactions under C2C and Business Solutions  transactions. The credit facility supports Western Union's $1.5 billion  commercial paper program. The revolving facility expires in September 2020.  Further support to liquidity is provided by FCF, which over the LTM ending March  31, 2016 was $481 million. As of March 31, 2016, debt totalled $3.2 billion consisting principally of  senior unsecured notes: $1 billion at 5.93% due October 2016; $500 million at  2.875% due December 2017; $400 million at 3.65% due August 2018, $250 million at  3.35% due May 2019; $325 million at 5.253% due April 2020; $500 million at 6.2%  due November 2036; and $250 million at 6.2% due June 2040. The company has a $575 million senior unsecured delayed-draw term loan in place  to refinance a portion of the $1 billion due in October 2016. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings, with a Stable Outlook: The Western Union Company --Long-Term IDR at 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured at 'BBB+'; --$1.65 billion senior unsecured credit facility at 'BBB+'; --Short-Term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial paper program at 'F2'.
